Our services offer clients a more cost-effective, secure and responsive infrastructure that can be scaled and adapted to their business needs.
Business Process Outsourcing Our business process outsourcing growth platform provides business process services that help clients drive business value, achieve higher levels of performance and results, and/or reduce costs. Through our BPO services, we manage specific business processes or functions for clients, providing solutions that are more efficient and cost-effective than if the functions were provided in-house while also providing business insight to drive business outcomes.

We also offer industry-specific BPO services designed to address the unique needs of client organizations and deliver business outcomes. We provide these services on a global basis and across all industry sectors through our Global Delivery Network.
Global Delivery Model A key Accenture differentiator is our strategic global delivery model, which allows us to draw on the benefits of using people and other resources from around the worldincluding scalable, standardized processes, methods and tools; specialized business process and technology skills; cost advantages; foreign-language fluency; proximity to clients; and time-zone advantagesto deliver high-quality solutions. Emphasizing quality, productivity, reduced risk, speed to market and predictability, our global delivery model enables us to provide clients with price-competitive services and solutions that drive higher levels of performance.
Our Global Delivery Network continues to be a competitive differentiator for us. We have more than 50 delivery centers around the world. As of August31, 2011, we had approximately 141,000 people in our network globally.
Alliances We have sales and delivery alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own, either by, among other things, enhancing a service offering, delivering a new technology or helping us extend our services to new geographies. By combining our alliance partners products and services with our own capabilities and expertise, we create innovative, high-value business solutions for our clients. Most of our alliances are non-exclusive. These alliances can generate significant revenues from services to implement our alliance partners products. We also receive some direct payments, which are not material to our business, from our alliance partners as compensation for marketing and other assistance.
Research and Innovation We are committed to developing leading-edge ideas. Research and innovation have been major factors in our success, and we believe they will help us continue to grow in the future.We use our investment in research and developmenton which we spent $503million, $384million and $435 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectivelyto help create, commercialize and disseminate innovative business strategies and technology solutions.
11 Table of Contents Our research and innovation program is designed to generate early insights into how knowledge can be harnessed to create innovative business solutions for our clients and to develop business strategies with significant value.One component of this is our research and development organization, Accenture Technology Labs, which identifies and develops new technologies that we believe will be the drivers of our clients growth and enable them to be first to market with unique capabilities.
We also promote the creation of knowledge capital and thought leadership through the Accenture Institute for High Performance.In addition, we spend a significant portion of our research and development investment directly through our operating groups and our consulting, technology and outsourcing growth platforms to develop market-ready solutions for our clients.
Employees Our most important asset is our people. The diverse and global makeup of our workforce enables us to serve our diverse and global client base. We are deeply committed to the continued development of our employees, who receive significant and focused technical, functional, industry, managerial and leadership skill development and training appropriate for their roles and levels within our company throughout their careers with us. We seek to reinforce our employees commitments to our clients, culture and values through a comprehensive performance management system and a career philosophy that rewards both individual performance and teamwork. We strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces collaboration, motivation and innovation and is consistent with our core values and Code of Business Ethics.
As of August31, 2011, we had approximately 236,000 employees worldwide.
Competition We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services competitive with those we offer. Our competitors include:  off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India, the Philippines and China, that offer services similar to those we offer, often at highly competitive prices and on more aggressive terms;  large multinational providers, including the service arms of large global technology providers (hardware and software), that offer some or all of the services that we do;  niche solution or service providers or local competitors that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including companies that provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models;  accounting firms that are expanding or building their provision of some consulting services, including through acquisitions; and  in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide.
Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, medium-sized companies, governments, government agencies and other enterprises. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include:  skills and capabilities of people;  innovative service and product offerings;  ability to add business value and improve performance; 12 Table of Contents  reputation and client references;  price;  ability to deliver results reliably and on a timely basis;  scope of services;  service delivery approach;  technical and industry expertise;  quality of services and solutions;  availability of appropriate resources; and  global reach and scale.
Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis.
Intellectual Property We provide value to our clients based in part on a differentiated range of proprietary inventions, methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital, and other intellectual property. We recognize the increasing value of intellectual property in the marketplace and create, harvest, and protect this intellectual property. We leverage patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property. We have also established policies to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties, such as Accentures clients, partners, and others.
As of August31, 2011, we had 2,718 patent applications pending in the United States and other jurisdictions and had been issued 600 U.S. patents and 524 non-U.S. patents.

Organizational Structure On September1, 2009, Accenture Ltd completed a transaction in which Accenture plc, organized in Ireland, became the parent holding company of Accenture. This transaction is described below under History.
Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company with no material assets other than ClassI common shares in its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares (Accenture SCA). Accenture plcs only business is to hold these shares. Accenture plc owns a majority voting interest in Accenture SCA. As the general partner of Accenture SCA and as a result of Accenture plcs majority voting interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc controls Accenture SCAs management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCAs results in its Consolidated Financial Statements. We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture SCA. Accenture SCA generally reimburses Accenture plc for its expenses but does not pay Accenture plc any fees. Accenture plc was elected the general partner of Accenture SCA in place of Accenture Ltd at the November16, 2009 shareholder meeting of Accenture SCA.
History Prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001, we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners. In connection with our transition to a corporate structure, our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares or, in the case of partners in certain countries, 13 Table of Contents Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA. Generally, partners who received Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd ClassX common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights. The combination of the Accenture Ltd ClassX common shares and the Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares.
In fiscal 2005, we replaced the internal use of the partner title with the more comprehensive senior executive title and applied the senior executive title to our highest-level employees, including those previously referred to as partners. However, for proper context, we continue to use the term partner in certain situations and particularly when discussing our reorganization and the period prior to our incorporation.
On June10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction). On August5, 2009, the shareholders of Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, voted in favor of the Transaction. The Transaction was subsequently completed on September1, 2009, following approval from the Supreme Court of Bermuda, at which time Accenture Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company. In the Transaction, all of the outstanding ClassA and Class X common shares of Accenture Ltd were cancelled and Accenture plc issued ClassA and Class X ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the cancelled Accenture Ltd ClassA and Class X common shares, as applicable (and cash for any fractional shares). Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December29, 2009.
ClassA ordinary shares of the Irish company, Accenture plc, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September1, 2009 under the symbol ACN, the same symbol under which ClassA common shares of Accenture Ltd, its predecessor, were previously listed.
The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report with respect to periods prior to September1, 2009 reflect the consolidated operations of Accenture Ltd (the predecessor registrant of Accenture plc) and its subsidiaries. The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report reflect the ownership interests in Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain of our current and former senior executives as noncontrolling interests. The noncontrolling ownership interests percentage was 9% as of August31, 2011.
Accenture plc ClassA and ClassX Ordinary Shares Each ClassA ordinary share and each ClassX ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc. A ClassX ordinary share does not, however, entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc. As described above under History, Class X ordinary shares generally provide the holders of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares with a vote at Accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shareholders, while their economic rights consist of interests in Accenture SCA Class I common shares or in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares.
Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any ClassX ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the ClassX ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share. Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture CanadaHoldings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any ClassX ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of ClassX ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the 14 Table of Contents number of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder. Accenture plc will redeem ClassX ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of ClassX ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. ClassX ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.
A transfer of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. Other transfers of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the ClassA ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer.
Accenture SCA ClassI Common Shares Only Accenture and our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees hold Accenture SCA ClassI common shares. Each ClassI common share entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to the shareholders of Accenture SCA and entitles its holder to dividends and liquidation payments. As of October11, 2011, Accenture holds a voting interest of approximately 91% of the aggregate outstanding Accenture SCA Class I common shares entitled to vote, with the remaining 9% of the voting interest held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees.
Accenture SCA is obligated, at the option of the holder, to redeem any outstanding Accenture SCA ClassI common share at a redemption price per share generally equal to its current market value as determined in accordance with Accenture SCAs articles of association. Under Accenture SCAs articles of association, the market value of a ClassI common share that is not subject to transfer restrictions will be deemed to be equal to (i)the average of the high and low sales prices of an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other designated market on which the ClassA ordinary shares trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs, or (ii)if Accenture plc sells its ClassA ordinary shares on the date that the redemption price is determined (other than in a transaction with any employee or an affiliate or pursuant to a preexisting obligation), the weighted average sales price of an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other market on which the ClassA ordinary shares primarily trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs. Accenture SCA may, at its option, pay this redemption price with cash or by delivering Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. In order to maintain Accenture plcs economic interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc generally will acquire additional Accenture SCA common shares each time additional Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares are issued.
Except in the case of a redemption of ClassI common shares or a transfer of ClassI common shares to Accenture plc or one of its subsidiaries, Accenture SCAs articles of association provide that Accenture SCA ClassI common shares may be transferred only with the consent of the general partner of Accenture SCA. In addition, all holders of ClassI common shares (except Accenture) are precluded from having their shares redeemed by Accenture SCA or transferred to Accenture SCA, Accenture plc or a subsidiary of Accenture plc at any time or during any period when Accenture SCA determines, based on the advice of counsel, that there is material non-public information that may affect the average price per share of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares, if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law, during an underwritten offering due to an underwriters lock-up or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by Accenture SCA or its affiliates for Accenture SCA ClassI common shares until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer (other than to tender the holders Accenture SCA ClassI common shares in the tender offer).
15 Table of Contents Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share entitles its holder. The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture or the other shareholders of Accenture SCA.
ITEM1A.RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies, including us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.
Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity.
Global economic conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve, and volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability. Volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets could undermine business confidence, both in those markets and other markets and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new technologies or initiatives or terminate existing contracts, which would negatively affect our business. Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate, for an extended period of time. Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve may affect demand for our services. A material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in Europe and North America. Weakening in these markets as a result of high government deficits, credit downgrades or otherwise, could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations. Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty affects our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand beyond the short term and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting. This could result, for example, in us not having the level of appropriate personnel where they are needed, and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations.
Our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services with favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product. As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic conditions could negatively affect client demand for our services and solutions. In addition, developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, could shift demand to services and solutions where we are less competitive, or might require significant investment by us to upgrade, enhance or expand our services 16 Table of Contents and solutions to meet that demand. Companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting, systems integration and technology, or outsourcing services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation. Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30days notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated profits lost upon termination of the contract. If a client is dissatisfied with our services and we are unable to effectively respond to its needs, the client might terminate existing contracts, or reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a clients strategy also are all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays. For example, in fiscal 2009, we experienced a higher volume of contract terminations and restructurings as a result of challenging economic conditions and clients being acquired, which negatively affected our results of operations. It could also result in pressure to reduce the cost of our services. For example, during fiscal years 2009 and 2010, challenging economic conditions led to our moving work more quickly into our Global Delivery Network than planned in order to respond to client demand to reduce costs, which resulted in our revenues being less than anticipated.
If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is intense. We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology and industry developments and grow and manage our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. As we expand our services and solutions, we also hire and must retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than the majority of our personnel. If we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work in those industries may suffer.
We are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses. This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense. Our geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets depends on our ability to attract, retain and integrate both local business leaders and people with the appropriate delivery skills.
17 Table of Contents Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis. If we are unable to effectively mobilize our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our ability to perform our work profitably could suffer. If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects. If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer. The costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant. The mobility of our employees also contributes to the effective operation of our global business model. Increased regulation of immigration or work visas, including limitations placed on the number of visas granted,limitationson the type ofwork performed or location in which it can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, could make it more difficult to deploy our employees on client engagements and could increase costs.
There is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if demand were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs. At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies. In these situations, we must evaluate voluntary attrition and use increased involuntary terminations and reduced levels of new hiring as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in those geographies.
The consulting and outsourcing markets are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
The markets in which we offer our services are highly competitive. Our competitors include:  off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India, the Philippines and China, that offer services similar to those we offer, often at highly competitive prices and on more aggressive contractual terms;  large multinational providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers (hardware and software), that offer some or all of the services that we do;  niche solution or service providers or local competitors that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including companies that provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models;  accounting firms that are expanding or building their provision of some consulting services, including through acquisitions; and  in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide.
Some competitors are companies that may have greater financial, marketing or other resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals.
Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients. Some competitors are more established in certain emerging markets, and that may make our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging. Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work. Our future performance is largely 18 Table of Contents dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, while expanding into additional markets. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
In addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector, through strategic mergers or acquisitions. Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint, or offerings that are more attractive than ours. For example, there has been a continuing trend toward consolidation among hardware manufacturers, software developers and vendors, and service providers, which has resulted in the convergence of products and services. Over time, our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation. Additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider, more integrated services (software and hardware) to clients than we can, and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients. If buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to such competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.
We could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and Accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached.
We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, alliance partners, and vendors. The breadth and complexity of this infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches. Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
In providing services to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the European Union Directive on Data Protection and various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or Accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including an attack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, could result in negative publicity, legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
Our business model is dependent on our Global Delivery Network, which includes Accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world. While these delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery network in India, where we 19 Table of Contents have the largest number of people in our delivery network located, and the Philippines, where we have the second largest number of people located. Concentrating our Global Delivery Network in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control. India and the Philippines have experienced natural disasters and are subject to pandemics, severe weather conditions, including earthquakes, volcanoes, cyclones, typhoons, floods and other storms, which may occur again and could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities. Additionally, both countries have experienced political instability and worker strikes. India in particular has experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries, including Pakistan. Military activity or civil hostilities in the future, as well as terrorist activities, natural disasters and other conditions, which are described more fully below, could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur. If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.
As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
We have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 54 countries around the world. One aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand globally, and particularly to seek significant growth in our priority emerging markets. We cannot guarantee that our growth strategy will be successful. If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates, international hostilities, natural disasters, security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected. In addition, emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets. Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us.
Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Although we report our results of operations in U.S.dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S.dollar. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S.dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S.dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items originally denominated in other currencies. These changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S.dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods.
As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services. An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee, against the U.S.dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency. There can be no assurance that our contractual provisions will offset their impact, or that our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, will be successful. This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing 20 Table of Contents delivery center resources. In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk. These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts and risks related to currency fluctuations. We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact our underlying exposures, perhaps eliminating them. Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place, not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure.
We could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies.
In some countries, we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations. This risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in emerging markets, which are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets.
International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations.
Acts of terrorist violence, political unrest, armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, natural disasters, like the earthquake and resulting tsunami in Japan in March 2011, global health risks or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us. These events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients. By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients. Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients. We might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars. If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.
We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and labor relations. This includes in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations. Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights.
In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010. Our employees, subcontractors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners 21 Table of Contents and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.
Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions. For example, because outsourcing and systems integration represent a significant portion of our business, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our government work, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations. Such changes may result in contracts being terminated, or work being transferred on-shore, resulting in greater costs to us and could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients.
Our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable us to meet our profitability expectations.
If we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing for our services to enable us to meet our profitability, our revenues and profitability expectations could materially suffer. The rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including:  general economic and political conditions;  the competitive environment in our industry, as described below;  our clients desire to reduce their costs;  our ability to accurately estimate, attain and sustain contract revenues, margins and cash flows over the full contract period, which includes our ability to estimate the impact of inflation and foreign exchange on our margins over long-term contracts; and  procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.
The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways, all of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities, with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider. In addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer. Increased competition from companies located in lower-cost locations has reduced the prices we can charge for some of our services, particularly in the outsourcing and systems integration markets. Competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share. Further, if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity, they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices.
If our pricing estimates do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or third parties upon which we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be unprofitable.
Our pricing for our services and solutions is highly dependent on our forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver such services and solutions, which might be based on 22 Table of Contents limited data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing projects to a clients satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned, or be unprofitable. Our pricing, cost and profit margin estimates on our consulting work and frequently on our outsourcing work, include anticipated long-term cost savings for the client that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract. We may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts. This could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
If we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale projects or enterprises. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on relationships with our clients and on our results of operations.
Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities. Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:  Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, the government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls, uncertainties or other debt constraints, such as those recently experienced in the U.S. and certain countries in Europe, could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.
Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts. If these audits conclude that the costs are not reimbursable, then we will not be allowed to bill for them, or the cost must be refunded to the government if it has already been paid to us. Findings from an audit also could result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed rates for our work, may affect our future profitability or may prevent us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time. In the U.S., pending final audit determinations, the government may require us not to bill a 23 Table of Contents percentage of our costs, and we may be subject to such requirement with respect to current open audits or future audits. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs and compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards, and conduct system reviews, investigations and other inquiries of our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts. In addition, if the government auditors find, and the Defense Contract Management Agency (which has administrative authority over our U.S. government contracts) concludes, that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs or may have to refund money that has already been paid to us.
If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.
U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations. Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of credible evidence of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government. Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level. Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
Because we are incorporated in Ireland, our U.S. federal practice operates under a separate agreement with the U.S. federal government in order to perform classified work for the U.S. government. We may be required by the government to amend the agreement from time to time, and we are currently in discussions with the U.S. government regarding proposed amendments. Depending on the outcome of those discussions, we might be required to adjust our current operations and/or incur additional costs in order to continue to perform certain services for the U.S. government, and we cannot predict at this time the total costs or whether the changes will adversely affect us.
Government contracts, and the proceedings surrounding them, are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than contracts with commercial clients. Negative publicity related to our government contracts, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.
Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.
Terms and conditions of government contracts tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate than those for commercial contracts. For example, government contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches, less favorable payment terms, and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.
24 Table of Contents  Legislative proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States in the future. Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States. While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way to negatively affect Accenture.
The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients. If any of the risks discussed above were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.
Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions.
We could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, or otherwise breach obligations, to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients. We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines. In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace. We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss. If we cannot or do not perform our obligations, we could face significant legal liability, and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope of our potential liability, because a third party may allege fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections. A failure of a clients system based on our services or solutions could subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations. If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide such solutions and services, and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, or if liability limitations are not enforced, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition to expense, litigation can be lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations, and litigation results can be unpredictable. While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities, and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and amount of our recovery.
Our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants.
Our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Current areas of significant change include mobility, cloud-based computing and the processing and analyzing of large amounts of data. Technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our 25 Table of Contents clients. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation for our core business as well as through new business initiatives beyond our core business that will enable us to differentiate our services and solutions. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected.
In addition, we operate in a quickly evolving environment, in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants. New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive, when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
Outsourcing services subject us to different operational risks than our consulting and systems integration services.
Outsourcing services, which represented approximately 41% of our net revenues in fiscal 2011, present different operational risks, when compared to our consulting and systems integration services. Our outsourcing services involve taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients businesses, which may include the operation of functions that are critical to the core businesses of our clients. In fiscal 2011, we expanded our outsourcing services and solutions into new areas, such as care management and mortgage processing, and we expect to continue to do so. Expanding into new areas may expose us to additional regulatory or other risks specific to such new areas. We could also incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to the services we provide clients.
We may also face exposure in our outsourcing business if we contribute to internal controls issues of a client. If a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures at the client or impair our clients ability to comply with its own internal control requirements, there is a risk that we could face legal liability. Many of our clients request that we obtain an audit under Statement on Auditing Standards No.70 (SAS 70) of the control activities we perform for them when we host or process data belonging to them (effective June15, 2011, SAS 70 was retired and replaced with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No.16 and International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3402). If we receive a qualified opinion, or do not deliver the audit reports timely, our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed.
Our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.
We cannot be sure that our services and solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cost us money or prevent us from offering some services or solutions. Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant time and effort over an extended period of time. In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client. Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, injure our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients. If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we cannot substitute alternative technology, our operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and firms have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of asserting claims of 26 Table of Contents infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies. If a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients, an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages.
We could lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others. Third-party suppliers of software, hardware or other intellectual assets could be acquired or sued, and this could disrupt use of their products or services by Accenture and our clients. If our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
We have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success.
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property. Existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours. Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.
Depending on the circumstances, we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do. In certain situations, we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create, which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients. Any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects.
Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches or service outages, internal control deficiencies, or other delivery failures. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, employees, competitors, vendors and alliance partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, government regulators, as well as members of the investment community and the media. There is a risk that negative information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.
27 Table of Contents Our alliance relationships may not be successful or may change, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own. A very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers which are our alliance partners. See BusinessAlliances. The priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours. As most of our alliance relationships are non-exclusive, our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors. One or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor, or key alliances partners might merge with each other, either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners. If we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
We may not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating other businesses.
We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions, intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions, or enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets. Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions. We may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates. We also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations. Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire. Ongoing business may be disrupted and our managements attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities. In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations. We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions. We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we undertake. We might not achieve our expected return on investment, or may lose money. We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from an acquired company, including from terminated employees, current or former clients, or other third parties, and may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company, which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.
Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability through improvements to cost-management to the degree we have done in the past.
Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity, optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues. We have also taken actions to reduce certain costs, and these initiatives include, without limitation, ongoing global consolidation of our office space and re-alignment of portions of our non-client-facing workforce to lower-cost locations. There is no guarantee that these, or other cost-management efforts will be successful, that our efficiency will be enhanced, or that we will achieve desired levels of 28 Table of Contents profitability. Over time, we have seen an improvement in general and administrative costs. Because of the significant steps taken in the past to reduce costs, we may not be able to continue to deliver efficiencies in our cost management, to the same degree as in the past. If we are not effective in reducing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to absorb or pass on increases in the compensation of our employees by moving more work to lower-cost locations or otherwise, our margins and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Many of our contracts include performance payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels. This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.
Many of our contracts include performance clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms. Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service levels. We also have a number of contracts, in both outsourcing and consulting, in which a portion of our fees or incentives depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate. These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.
Changes in our level of taxes, and audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in our treatment as an Irish company, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, or may take increasingly aggressive positions with respect to the judgments we make. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control. For example, Ireland faces continuing economic uncertainty, including in connection with its outstanding debt obligations. These uncertainties have led to discussion regarding a potential increase to the corporate tax rate. Increases in the tax rate in Ireland or any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a negative impact on our profitability. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable, particularly in less developed markets, and could become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the U.S. and Ireland, there can be no assurance that legislative or diplomatic action will not be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty. Our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or 29 Table of Contents significant additional expense. Congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could subject us to increased taxation. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with the United States. These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or these other jurisdictions.
If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
As of August31, 2011, we had approximately 236,000employees worldwide. Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges. It might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge. It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations. Finally, the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances. For example, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired.
If we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed. We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. In limited circumstances, we also extend financing to our clients. We have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services. Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. Recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.
Our share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict.
Our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors. These factors include:  changes in macroeconomic or political factors unrelated to our business;  general or industry-specific market conditions or changes in financial markets;  announcements by us or competitors about developments in our business or prospects; 30 Table of Contents  projections or speculation about our business or that of competitors by the media or investment analysts;  our ability to generate enough free cash flow to return cash to our shareholders at historical levels or levels expected by our shareholders; and  our failure to meet our growth and financial objectives, including with respect to our overall revenue growth and revenue growth for our priority emerging markets and earnings per share growth.
Our results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, making them difficult to predict. Some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include:  the business decisions of our clients to begin to curtail or reduce the use of our services, including in response to changes in macroeconomic or political conditions unrelated to our business or general market conditions;  periodic differences between our clients estimated and actual levels of business activity associated with ongoing work, as well as the stage of completion of existing projects and/or their termination or restructuring;  contract delivery inefficiencies, such as those due to poor delivery or changes in forecasts;  our ability to transition employees quickly from completed to new projects and maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our workforces;  acquisition, integration and operational costs related to businesses acquired;  the introduction of new products or services by us, competitors or alliance partners;  changes in our pricing or competitors pricing;  our ability to manage costs, including those for our own or subcontracted personnel, travel, support services and severance;  changes in, or the application of changes in, accounting principles or pronouncements under U.S.generally accepted accounting principles, particularly those related to revenue recognition;  currency exchange rate fluctuations;  changes in estimates, accruals or payments of variable compensation to our employees;  global, regional and local economic and political conditions and related risks, including acts of terrorism; and  seasonality, including number of workdays and holiday and summer vacations.
As a result of any of the above factors, or any of the other risks described in this Item1A, Risk Factors, our share price could be difficult to predict and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future. In addition, if litigation is instituted against us following declines in our share price, we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation, and our share price could be materially adversely affected.
Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.
The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over 31 Table of Contents financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.
We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S.federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S.courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. The laws of Ireland do however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts. Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the United States judgment. The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy. Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland. Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
Some companies that conduct business in the United States but are domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over U.S. companies. Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company, and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations. Nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our current incorporation in Ireland.
Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Acts 1963 to 2009 of Ireland (the Companies Acts). The Companies Acts differ in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S.corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.
32 Table of Contents Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances. Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company. Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries. If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.
We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders ownership interest in us.
We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:  take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion;  acquire other businesses or assets;  repurchase shares from our shareholders;  develop new services and solutions;or  respond to competitive pressures.
Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders ownership percentage in us. Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.

As previously reported, in April 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice intervened in a civil qui tam action previously filed under seal by two private individuals (relators) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas against Accenture and several of its indirect subsidiaries.The complaint as 33 Table of Contents amended alleged that, in connection with work we undertook for the U.S. federal government, we received payments, resale revenue or other benefits as a result of, or otherwise acted improperly in connection with, alliance agreements we maintain with technology vendors and others in violation of contracts with the U.S. government and/or applicable law or regulations.Similar suits were brought against other companies in our industry.On September9, 2011, we entered into an agreementto settle the lawsuit. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to pay the United States$63.675 million, in consideration for the release of all claims alleged by the government and the relators against us in the matter, and we expressly denied any wrongdoing.The relators will petition the court for attorneys fees and costs associated with the matter, and we expect to have to litigate the basis for and amounts of those fees and costs.
We currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate, including coverage for professional liability, general liability and management liability. We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form10-K.
We use the terms Accenture, we, the Company, our and us in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August31. For example, a reference to fiscal 2011 means the 12-month period that ended on August31, 2011. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
We use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year periods foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
Overview Our results of operations can be affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, credit market conditions and levels of business confidence. Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
Revenues before reimbursements (net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $6.69 billion, compared with $5.42 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 23% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency. Net revenues for fiscal 2011 were $25.51 billion, compared with $21.55 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 18% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. This very strong growth during fiscal 2011 contrasts with a 2% local currency revenue decline during fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009. All of our operating groups experienced year-over-year revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, with very strong growth in Resources and Products. Based on new contract bookings over the last several quarters, we expect growth to continue in most areas of our business. We also expect the level of year-over-year growth will moderate, particularly in consulting, and vary across operating groups and geographic regions. There continues to be significant volatility in markets around the world, as well as economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Such volatility and uncertainty, should it continue, could adversely affect our clients and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate. We continue to monitor our costs closely in order to respond to changing conditions and to manage any impact to our results of operations.
In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $3.88 billion, compared with $3.09 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 25% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency. Consulting net revenues for fiscal 2011 were $14.92 billion, compared with $12.37 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency. All five operating groups experienced year-over-year consulting revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, driven by very strong growth in Resources and Products. In our consulting business overall, clients continue to focus on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.
42 Table of Contents Compared to fiscal 2010, we are providing a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network and we expect this trend to continue in the medium term. While the business environment remains competitive, pricing is stable with some improvement in certain areas of our business.
In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $2.81 billion, compared with $2.33 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency. Outsourcing net revenues for fiscal 2011 were $10.58 billion, compared with $9.18 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency. All five operating groups experienced year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, led by Communications& High Tech and Financial Services. Clients continue to be focused on projects that will improve operational effectiveness. Growth in outsourcing is driven by higher volumes, scope and geographic expansions and new work at existing clients, as well as services for new clients. As with systems integration consulting, compared to fiscal 2010 we are providing a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network.
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower. When compared to fiscal 2010, the U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies during fiscal 2011. This resulted in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue results that were approximately 9% and 3% better than our results in local currency for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2011, respectively.
The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with new outsourcing contracts. Utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals time spent on billable work. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was approximately 85% and within our target range. This level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network and in most countries. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand.
We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 236,000 as of August31, 2011, compared with approximately 223,000 as of May31, 2011 and 204,000 as of August31, 2010. This 16% year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services, including those delivered through our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was 14%, compared with 15% in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and 17% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We adjust levels of new hiring, evaluate voluntary attrition and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand. In addition, we also adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees, and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2012 became effective September1, 2011. As in prior fiscal years, we strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins 43 Table of Contents could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand, mobilize our employees globally on a timely basis, manage attrition, recover increases in compensation and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was 33.1%, compared with 34.0% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Gross margin for fiscal 2011 was 32.9%, compared with 33.6% for fiscal 2010. Our contract profitability for fiscal 2011 was lower than fiscal 2010, as we continued our efforts to absorb higher annual compensation increases and subcontractor costs with improved pricing and a more efficient resource mix. Gross margin also includes the impact of higher recruiting and training costs from the addition of a large number of new employees to meet demand.
Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 19.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, compared with 20.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 19.3% for fiscal 2011, compared with 20.1% for fiscal 2010. Sales and marketing is driven primarily by compensation costs for business-development activities, investment in offerings, and marketing- and advertising-related activities. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate, to maintain or lower these costs as a percentage of revenues.These actions include performing a greater proportion of general and administrative activities in lower-cost locations. For fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 0.2%, while general and administrative costs decreased 0.6% as a percentage of net revenues. The decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues was due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues, as well as a reduction in the bad debt reserve, partially offset by a provision for litigation matters. While we continue to manage these costs, we expect the reduction in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues to moderate in fiscal 2012. Our margins could be adversely affected if our cost-management actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues.
Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was $923 million, compared with $714 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Operating income for fiscal 2011 was $3,470 million, compared with $2,915 million for fiscal 2010. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was 13.8%, compared with 13.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Operating margin for fiscal 2011 was 13.6%, compared with 13.5% for fiscal 2010.
Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for net revenues. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Bookings and Backlog New contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $8.44 billion, with consulting bookings of $4.16 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.28 billion. New contract bookings for fiscal 2011 were $28.83 billion, with consulting bookings of $15.41 billion and outsourcing bookings of $13.42 billion.
44 Table of Contents We provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. However, new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. Clients continue to seek flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting consulting work, which is resulting in smaller initial total contract values than in the past. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. New contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New contract bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.
Revenue Recognition Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.
We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Our contracts for technology integration consulting generally span one to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
45 Table of Contents Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB101), as amended by SABNo.104, Revenue Recognition (SAB104). We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SAB101, as amended by SAB104. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs.
Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the elements relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future 46 Table of Contents delivery of another element. The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value of each element. VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.
Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.
Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.
We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with FASB guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.
47 Table of Contents No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings.
As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.
Revenues by Segment/Operating Group Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications& High Tech, Financial Services, Health& Public Service, Products and Resources. Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.
From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.
While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does 48 Table of Contents not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.

We conduct business in the following countries that individually comprised 10% or more of consolidated net revenues within fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009: Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 United States 35 % 36 % 36 % United Kingdom 10 10 10 49 Table of Contents Net Revenues The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010: Operating Groups  Communications& High Tech net revenues increased 14% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, with the exception of Electronics& High Tech in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, with the exception of Electronics& High Tech in EMEA.
Financial Services net revenues increased 18% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth in Banking and Insurance in EMEA and all industry groups in Americas, partially offset by a decline in Banking in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues reflected significant growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Americas and EMEA.
Health& Public Service net revenues increased 7% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected growth in Americas and Asia Pacific, with significant growth in Health, partially offset by a decline in Public Service in EMEA. The increase in consulting revenues was significantly impacted by a delivery inefficiency on a consulting contract in Public Service in Americas in fiscal 2010, which negatively affected revenues in that period. Outsourcing revenues increased due to growth in Americas, partially offset by a decrease in Public Service in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues also reflected revenues recognized upon favorable resolution of billing holdbacks on certain contracts with United States government agencies. In addition, the uncertainty and challenges in the public sector, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom and several other countries, continue to have a significant impact on demand in our public service business. This had a negative impact on our revenues and new contract bookings in our public service business during fiscal 2011, and we expect this trend to continue.
Products net revenues increased 16% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected significant growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Consumer Goods& Services and Automotive. Outsourcing revenues increased, driven by growth across all geographic regions and most industry groups, led by Retail in Americas and Asia Pacific and Air, Freight& Travel Services in Americas and EMEA.
Resources net revenues increased 21% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected very significant growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Natural Resources and Energy. Outsourcing revenues increased, driven by growth in Energy and Natural Resources in Americas and Utilities and Energy in EMEA. Lower client demand for outsourcing services resulted in moderation of outsourcing revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and a shift in the mix of work towards consulting. This trend is expected to continue for the near term.
Geographic Regions  Americas net revenues increased 17% in local currency, led by the United States, Brazil and Canada.
EMEA net revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by growth in local currency in most countries, led by the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa and Switzerland.
50 Table of Contents  Asia Pacific net revenues increased 23% in local currency, led by Japan, Australia, Singapore, China and India.
Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2011 were $23,882 million, an increase of $3,703 million, or 18%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 87.3% from 87.4% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2011 were $22,037 million, an increase of $3,401 million, or 18%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.4% from 86.5% during this period.
Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2011 was $18,966 million, an increase of $3,123 million, or 20%, over fiscal 2010, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.3% from 68.6% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2011 was $17,120 million, an increase of $2,820 million, or 20%, over fiscal 2010, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.1% from 66.4% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2011 decreased to 32.9% from 33.6% during this period. Our contract profitability for fiscal 2011 was lower than the same period in fiscal 2010, as we continued our efforts to absorb higher annual compensation increases and subcontractor costs with improved pricing and a more efficient resource mix. Gross margin also includes the impact of higher recruiting and training costs from the addition of a large number of new employees to meet demand.
Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2011 was $3,094 million, an increase of $436 million, or 16%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 12.1% from 12.3% during this period.
General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2011 were $1,820 million, an increase of $152 million, or 9%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 7.1% from 7.7% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues, as well as a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services due to better than expected bad debt experience, partially offset by a provision for litigation matters of $75 million.
51 Table of Contents Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2011 was $3,470 million, an increase of $556 million, or 19%, over fiscal 2010, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 13.6% from 13.5% during this period. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal Increase(1) 2011 2010 Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications& High Tech $ 728 13 % $ 615 13 % $ 113 Financial Services 898 17 772 17 126 Health& Public Service 318 8 287 8 32 Products 680 11 592 12 88 Resources 846 17 649 17 197 Total $ 3,470 13.6 % $ 2,915 13.5 % $ 556 (1) May not total due to rounding.
We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income during fiscal 2011 was similar to that disclosed for Net revenues. During fiscal 2011, each operating group benefited from our management of general and administrative costs at a growth rate lower than that of our net revenues, as well as a reduction in the bad debt reserve. In addition, in fiscal 2011 each operating group experienced higher recruiting and training costs from the addition of a large number of new employees to meet demand and recorded a portion of the provision for litigation matters. The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2011, compared with fiscal 2010, exclusive of these impacts.
Communications& High Tech operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.
Financial Services operating income increased, primarily due to very strong revenue growth, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability.
Health& Public Service operating income increased due to revenue growth, including revenues recognized upon favorable resolution of billing holdbacks on certain contracts with United States government agencies, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability.Fiscal 2010 operating income included the negative impact of inefficient delivery on a few consulting contracts in Public Service.
Products operating income increased, primarily driven by revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability. Products operating results in both periods were also impacted by expected lower margins on certain contracts.
Resources operating income increased, primarily driven by significant consulting revenue growth.
Interest Income Interest income for fiscal 2011 was $41million, an increase of $11million, or 37%, over fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates and cash balances.
52 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net for fiscal 2011 was $17 million, an increase of $32 million over fiscal 2010. The change was driven by net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2011, compared with net foreign exchange losses during fiscal 2010.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 27.3%, compared with 29.3% for fiscal 2010. The effective tax rate was lower in fiscal 2011 due to a number of factors that impact our geographic mix of income, partially offset by a net increase in reserves related to ongoing tax audits.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See BusinessOrganizational Structure. The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2011 was $276 million, a decrease of $4 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2010. The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 10% for fiscal 2011 from 13% for fiscal 2010, partially offset by an increase in Net income of $493 million.
Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $3.40 for fiscal 2011, compared with $2.66 for fiscal 2010. The $0.74 increase in our earnings per share was due toincreases of $0.42 from higher revenues and operating results in local currency, $0.11 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, $0.09 from a lower effective tax rate, $0.08 from favorable foreign currency exchange rates and $0.04 from higher non-operating income, compared with fiscal 2010. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Net Revenues The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenues changes in aggregate for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009: Operating Groups  Communications& High Tech net revenues decreased 7% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined significantly in local currency, primarily due to declines across all industry groups in EMEA and Asia Pacific. While the fiscal 2010 consulting revenues reflected a decline, strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter partially offset revenue declines in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. The consulting revenue decline reflected some clients continuing to seek flexibility by shifting to a more phased approach to contracting work and focusing on managing 54 Table of Contents the scope of existing projects. Outsourcing revenues declined modestly in local currency, primarily due to a significant decline in Communications in Americas, partially offset by growth in Electronics& High Tech in Americas and Asia Pacific and Media& Entertainment in EMEA and Americas. Client strategy changes, which began in fiscal 2009, particularly in Communications, resulted in a number of contract modifications, which had a negative impact on outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2010.
Financial Services net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 more than offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Consulting revenues increased in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Banking across all geographic regions and Capital Markets in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by declines in Insurance in EMEA and Americas. Outsourcing revenues declined significantly in local currency, primarily due to declines in Banking in EMEA and Americas, partially offset by growth in Insurance in EMEA. Modest year-over-year outsourcing growth in the fourth quarter partially offset revenue declines in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. Client consolidations and strategy changes that resulted in contract terminations in fiscal 2009 had a negative impact on our outsourcing revenue in fiscal 2010.
Health& Public Service net revenues declined 4% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined in local currency, primarily due to a decline in Public Service in Americas, principally due to the impact of inefficient delivery on a contract, and declines in Health in Americas and EMEA and Public Service in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues increased modestly in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Americas in Health and Public Service. In addition, the growing uncertainty and challenges in the public sector, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom and several other countries in Europe, continued to have a significant impact on demand in our public service business throughout the world. The uncertainty of the economic situation resulted in longer sales cycles and a shift to a more phased approach to contracting work, with a focus on near-term cost savings rather than large transformational projects.
Products net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 more than offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Consulting revenues declined modestly in local currency, primarily due to declines in EMEA and Americas across all industry groups except Consumer Goods& Services, which experienced significant growth in Americas. Consulting revenues reflected the continuation of the more conservative spending patterns of our clients, which began in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. In addition, consulting revenues were negatively impacted by a significant reduction in revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 at two large clients as a result of completing several large projects and transitioning from front-end consulting to outsourcing services. Outsourcing revenues increased in local currency, primarily driven by growth across all geographic regions and across all industry groups except Retail in Americas and Asia Pacific.
Resources net revenues decreased 2% in local currency. While the fiscal 2010 net revenues reflected a decline, year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 partially offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Consulting revenues declined modestly in local currency, primarily due to declines in EMEA across all industry groups and in Utilities in Americas and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in Energy in Americas. Consulting revenues were impacted by our clients continued caution in launching new programs as well as their focus on slowing the pace of existing projects. Outsourcing revenues increased modestly in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Energy in Americas and Natural Resources in Asia Pacific, partially offset by declines in Utilities and Chemicals in Americas.
55 Table of Contents Geographic Regions  Americas net revenues decreased 1% in local currency. While the fiscal 2010 net revenues reflected a decline, year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010, particularly in the United States, partially offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. We experienced declines in local currency across most countries in Americas, principally due to decreases in the United States and Brazil.
EMEA net revenues decreased 4% in local currency. While the fiscal 2010 net revenues reflected a decline, year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 partially offset revenue declines in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. We experienced declines in local currency across many countries in EMEA, principally due to decreases in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy and France. These declines were partially offset by growth in several countries, led by the United Kingdom.
Asia Pacific net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 more than offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Growth in local currency was principally driven by our business in Singapore and Malaysia, partially offset by declines in Australia and Japan.
Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2010 were $20,179 million, a decrease of $348 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 87.4% from 88.6% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2010 were $18,636 million, a decrease of $297 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.5% from 87.7% during this period.
Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2010 was $15,843 million, a decrease of $487 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 68.6% from 70.5% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2010 was $14,300 million, a decrease of $436 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 66.4% from 68.3% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2010 increased to 33.6% from 31.7% during this period. The primary driver for the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2010 was a change related to the implementation of our sales-effectiveness model, which directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business-development activities and streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities.
Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2010 was $2,658 million, an increase of $499 million, or 23%, over fiscal 2009, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 12.3% from 10.0% during this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by a change related to the implementation of our sales-effectiveness model, which directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business-development activities and streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities.
56 Table of Contents General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2010 were $1,668 million, a decrease of $120 million, or 7%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 7.7% from 8.3% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the $72 million bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, as well as expense savings resulting from the global consolidation of office space in fiscal 2009.
Reorganization and Restructuring Costs, net We recorded net reorganization costs of $10million for fiscal 2010, compared with net reorganization benefits of $3million for fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. For additional information, refer to Note3 (Reorganization and Restructuring Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
We recorded restructuring costs of $253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. These costs included $111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and $142 million related to realignment of our workforce, primarily at the senior-executive level, to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future.
Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2010 was $2,915 million, an increase of $271 million, or 10%, over fiscal 2009, and increased as percentage of net revenues to 13.5% from 12.3% during this period. The restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs in fiscal 2009, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2010 increased 10 basis points compared with fiscal 2009. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications& High Tech $ 615 13 % $ 608 13 % $ 7 Financial Services 772 17 467 11 305 Health& Public Service 287 8 480 13 (193 ) Products 592 12 531 11 61 Resources 649 17 558 14 91 Total $ 2,915 13.5 % $ 2,644 12.3 % $ 271 57 Table of Contents Operating Income and Operating Margin Excluding Restructuring Costs (Non-GAAP) FY10 Operating Income as Reported (GAAP) compared to FY09 Operating Income Excluding Restructuring Costs (Non-GAAP) Fiscal (Decrease) Increase(1) 2010 2009 Operating Income Operating Margin Restructuring Costs(2) OperatingIncome Excluding Restructuring Costs Operating Margin (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications& High Tech $ 615 13 % $ 49 $ 657 14 % $ (42 ) Financial Services 772 17 53 521 12 252 Health& Public Service 287 8 46 525 14 (239 ) Products 592 12 58 589 12 3 Resources 649 17 46 604 16 45 Total(1) $ 2,915 13.5 % $ 253 $ 2,896 13.4 % $ 18 (1) May not total due to rounding.
(2) Represents restructuring costs related to reducing excess real estate capacity and to realign the workforce incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. We have presented Operating income and operating margin excluding restructuring costs, because the restructuring costs meaningfully affect the comparability of our results of operations between periods. We believe that providing investors with this information gives additional insights into our ongoing results of operations.
We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income during fiscal 2010 was similar to that disclosed for Net revenues. In fiscal 2009, each operating group recorded a portion of the $72 million bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter and the $253 million restructuring cost recorded in the fourth quarter. Additionally, in fiscal 2010, each operating group experienced expense savings resulting from the global consolation of office space in fiscal 2009. See General and Administrative Costs and Reorganization and Restructuring Costs, net. The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009, exclusive of foreign currency exchange rates, bad debt provision and restructuring cost impacts.
Communications& High Tech operating income decreased, primarily due to revenue declines and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, offset by improved outsourcing contract profitability.
Financial Services operating income increased, primarily driven by consulting revenue growth, improved utilization and outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by a decline related to lower outsourcing revenues.
Health& Public Service operating income decreased, primarily due to inefficient delivery on a few consulting contracts, higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues and lower consulting contract profitability. In addition, fiscal 2009 results were favorably impacted by the resolution of a contract termination.
Products operating income was flat, as an increase related to higher outsourcing revenues was offset by a decline related to lower consulting revenues, lower consulting contract profitability and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues.
Resources operating income increased, primarily driven by improved utilization, partially offset by a decline related to lower consulting revenues.
58 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income was $30million in fiscal 2010, a decrease of $20million, or 40%, from fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates.
Other Expense, net Other expense, net was $16 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $12 million over fiscal 2009. The change was driven by higher net foreign currency exchange losses during fiscal 2010.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates for fiscal 2010 and 2009 were 29.3% and 27.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate increased in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of lower benefits related to adjustments to prior-year tax liabilities in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009, partially offset by changes in the geographic distribution of income.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $280 million in fiscal 2010, a decrease of $68 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 13% for fiscal 2010 from 17% for fiscal 2009.
Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.66 for fiscal 2010, compared with $2.44 for fiscal 2009. The $0.22 increase in fiscal 2010 earnings per share compared with fiscal 2009 earnings per share was primarily due to the following: a $0.24 increase reflecting the impact of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009; a $0.07 increase from a lower share count; and a $0.06 increase from favorable foreign exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by the following: a $0.04 decrease from lower revenue and operating income in local currency; a $0.01 decrease from lower reorganization benefits; a $0.03 decrease from lower non-operating items; and a $0.07 decrease from a higher effective income tax rate. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to:  take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion;  acquire complementary businesses or technologies;  develop new services and solutions; or  facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of Accenture shares.
As of August31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents was $5.7billion, compared with $4.8 billion as of August31, 2010.
59 Table of Contents Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 2011to2010 Change(1) (in millions of U.S. dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,442 $ 3,092 $ 3,160 $ 350 Investing activities (703 ) (274 ) (245 ) (430 ) Financing activities (2,122 ) (2,429 ) (1,850 ) 308 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 246 (92 ) (126 ) 338 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 863 $ 297 $ 939 $ 566 (1) May not total due to rounding.
Operating activities: The $350million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income and changes in other operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by an increase in net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services and deferred revenues).
Investing activities: The $430million increase in cash used was primarily due to increased spending on business acquisitions and property and equipment. For additional information, see Note6 (Business Combinations and Goodwill) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Financing activities: The $308 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower cash dividends paid as a result of our transition to semi-annual dividend payments. For additional information, see Note13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.
60 Table of Contents Borrowing Facilities As of August31, 2011, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities (inmillionsofU.S.dollars) Syndicated loan facility(1) $ 1,200 $  Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities(2) 480  Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit(3) 169  Total $ 1,849 $  (1) This facility, which matures on July31, 2012, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit.

Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares, Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees. As of August31, 2011, our aggregate available authorization was $1,042 million for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and these other share purchase programs.
Our share purchase activity during fiscal 2011 was as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture SCA Class I CommonSharesandAccentureCanada HoldingsInc.ExchangeableShares Shares Amount Shares Amount (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Open-market share purchases(1) 24,348,140 $ 1,306  $  Other share purchase programs   11,744,554 572 Other purchases(2) 6,665,101 293   Total(3) 31,013,241 $ 1,600 11,744,554 $ 572 (1) We conduct a publicly announced, open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares.

61 Table of Contents We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2012. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted, and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.
Other Share Redemptions During fiscal 2011, we issued 6,837,070 Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the registration statement). The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees.
Subsequent Developments On September26, 2011, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.675 per share on our ClassA ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October14, 2011. Accenture plc will cause Accenture SCA to declare a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.675 per share on its ClassI common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October11, 2011. Both dividends are payable on November15, 2011.
On September26, 2011, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved $5.0 billion in additional share repurchase authority bringing Accentures total outstanding authority to approximately $6.0 billion.
62 Table of Contents Obligations and Commitments As of August31, 2011, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Contractual Cash Obligations(1)(2) Total(5) Lessthan 1 year 1-3years 3-5years Morethan 5 years (in millions of U.S. dollars) Long-term debt $ 4 $ 4 $  $  $  Operating leases 1,842 427 543 317 556 Retirement obligations(3) 113 12 24 23 55 Purchase obligations and other commitments(4) 241 112 93 21 14 Total $ 2,200 $ 555 $ 660 $ 361 $ 625 (1) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, refer to Note9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
(2) In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August31, 2011, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $307 million, of which $295 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12months. The reorganization liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and/or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note3 (Reorganization and Restructuring Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
(3) Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May15, 2001.
(4) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.
(5) May not total due to rounding.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.
Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the clients claim. Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.
For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
63 Table of Contents Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In September2010, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. The guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation in previous guidance; requires that arrangement considerations be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price; and requires a vendor to use estimates of a selling price developed in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis for all deliverables that meet the remaining separation criteria when vendor-specific objective evidence and third-party evidence, respectively, do not exist as estimates of selling price. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
ITEM7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.
Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.
Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedgesprimarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar and U.S. dollar/Norwegian kroneare intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedgesU.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Euro/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three yearsare intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by Accentures Global Delivery Network.
For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of Services. As of August31, 2011, it was anticipated that $9million of the net gains, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into Cost of Services within the next 12months.
We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S.dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $358million and $218million as of August31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
64 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August31, 2011 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.
Equity Price Risk The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We also have audited Accenture plcs internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Accenture plcs management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A(b)). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Accenture plc maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The Company, as of September1, 2009, adopted guidance on noncontrolling interests and business combinations.

F-8 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business Accenture plc is one of the worlds leading management consulting, technology services and outsourcing organizations and operates globally with one common brand and business model designed to enable it to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service. Drawing on a combination of industry expertise, functional capabilities, alliances, global resources and technology, Accenture plc delivers competitively priced, high-value services that help clients measurably improve business performance. Accenture plcs global delivery model enables it to provide a complete end-to-end delivery capability by drawing on its global resources to deliver high-quality, cost-effective solutions to clients under demanding timeframes.
Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture plc, an Irish company, and its controlled subsidiary companies (collectively, the Company). Accenture plcs only business is to hold Class I common shares in, and to act as the sole general partner of, its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares. The Company operates its business through Accenture SCA and subsidiaries of Accenture SCA. Accenture plc controls Accenture SCAs management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCAs results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
The shares of Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than the Company are treated as a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The noncontrolling interest percentages were 9% and 11% as of August31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Purchases and/or redemptions of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares are accounted for at carryover basis.
All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to the Companys fiscal year, which ends on August31. For example, a reference to fiscal 2011 means the 12-month period that ended on August31, 2011. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of the Companys fiscal year.
Reincorporation in Ireland On June10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of the Companys parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction). On August5, 2009, the shareholders of Accenture Ltd, the Companys predecessor holding company, voted in favor of the Transaction. The Transaction was subsequently completed on September1, 2009, following approval from the Supreme Court of Bermuda, at which time Accenture Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became the Companys parent holding company. Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December22, 2009.
Use of Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.
F-9 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Reclassifications Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2011 presentation. In addition, on September1, 2009, the Company streamlined its approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities. This resulted in a greater amount of payroll costs for the Companys client-services personnel being recorded in Sales and marketing rather than Cost of services. The Company has not reclassified fiscal 2009 amounts to conform to the fiscal 2011 and 2010 presentation, as it would be impractical to do so.
Revenue Recognition Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where the Company designs/redesigns, builds and implements new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for its clients are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Contracts for technology integration consulting generally span one to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If the Companys estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB101), as amended by SABNo.104, Revenue Recognition (SAB104). The Company considers amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, the Companys efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, the Company recognizes revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, the Company hires client employees and becomes responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the F-10 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SAB101, as amended by SAB104. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, the Companys effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $547,308 and $508,829 as of August31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Deferred transition revenues were $553,232 and $496,646 as of August31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in non-current Deferred revenues relating to contract costs.
The Company enters into contracts that may consist of multiple elements. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the elements relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value of each element. VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with the Companys accounting policies for the separate elements, as described above. Elements qualify for separation when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Companys control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as the Company also sells those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
F-11 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Revenues before reimbursements (net revenues) include the margin earned on computer hardware and software, as well as revenues from alliance agreements. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. The Company reports revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
Employee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.
Income Taxes The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company establishes liabilities or reduces assets for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes those tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged. Each fiscal quarter, the Company evaluates these uncertain tax positions and adjusts the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances.
Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts Assets and liabilities of non-U.S.subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S.dollar are translated into U.S.dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including money market funds of $1,150,000 and $425,000 as of August31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As a result of certain subsidiaries cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash payables. Such negative balances are classified as Current portion of long term debt and bank borrowings.
Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances The Company records its client receivables and unbilled services at their face amounts less allowances. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its receivables and unbilled services and establishes allowances based on historical experience and other currently available information. As of F-12 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) August31, 2011 and 2010, total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $73,296 and $104,753, respectively. The allowance reflects the Companys best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables and unbilled services. In limited circumstances, the Company agrees to extend financing to certain clients. The terms vary by contract, but generally payment for services is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestones.
Concentrations of Credit Risk The Companys financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments, client receivables and unbilled services, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducts ongoing evaluation of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business. Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.
Investments All liquid investments with an original maturity greater than 90days but less than one year are considered to be short-term investments. Investments with an original maturity greater than one year are considered to be long-term investments. Marketable short-term and long-term investments are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale investments. Available-for-sale investments are reported at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Quoted market prices are used to determine the fair values of common equity and debt securities that were issued by publicly traded entities. Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in Interest income. Realized gains and losses on securities are determined based on the First In, First Out method and are included in (Loss) gain on investments, net. The Company does not hold these investments for speculative or trading purposes.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: Buildings 20 to 25 years Computers, related equipment and software 2 to 7 years Furniture and fixtures 5 to 10 years Leasehold improvements Lesser of lease term or 15 years Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future net cash flows. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.
F-13 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Operating Expenses Selected components of operating expenses were as follows: Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 Training costs $ 810,387 $ 591,229 $ 794,218 Research and development costs 503,222 383,700 434,937 Advertising costs 69,767 71,157 77,315 (Release of) provision for doubtful accounts(1) (24,361 ) 3,345 75,008 (1) For additional information, see Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In September2010, the Company adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. The guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation in previous guidance; requires that arrangement considerations be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price; and requires a vendor to use estimates of a selling price developed in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis for all deliverables that meet the remaining separation criteria when vendor-specific objective evidence and third-party evidence, respectively, do not exist as estimates of selling price. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
On September1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance issued by the FASB on business combinations. The guidance establishes principles and requirements for: recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; expensing acquisition-related costs as incurred; and determining what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The Companys adoption of the guidance on business combinations did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
On September1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance issued by the FASB on noncontrolling interests, which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, previously referred to as minority interest, to be presented as a separate component in the shareholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As required, the guidance on noncontrolling interests was applied prospectively with the exception of presentation and disclosure requirements, which were applied retrospectively for all periods presented.
Subsequent Events The Company has evaluated events and transactions subsequent to the balance sheet date. Based on this evaluation, the Company is not aware of any events or transactions (other than those disclosed herein) that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date but prior to filing that would require recognition or disclosure in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
F-14 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 2.EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows: Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 Basic Earnings per share Net income attributable to Accenture plc $ 2,277,677 $ 1,780,656 $ 1,589,963 Basic weighted average ClassA ordinary shares 645,631,170 637,170,234 623,007,198 Basic earnings per share $ 3.53 $ 2.79 $ 2.55 Diluted Earnings per share Net income attributable to Accenture plc $ 2,277,677 $ 1,780,656 $ 1,589,963 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.(1) 243,575 257,636 330,080 Net income for diluted earnings per share calculation $ 2,521,252 $ 2,038,292 $ 1,920,043 Basic weighted average ClassA ordinary shares 645,631,170 637,170,234 623,007,198 ClassA ordinary shares issuable upon redemption/exchange of noncontrolling interests(1) 69,326,725 92,279,826 127,461,437 Diluted effect of employee compensation related to ClassA ordinary shares(2) 27,096,115 36,825,333 36,284,449 Diluted effect of share purchase plans related to ClassA ordinary shares 130,530 303,585 138,260 Diluted weighted average ClassA ordinary shares 742,184,540 766,578,978 786,891,344 Diluted earnings per share(2) $ 3.40 $ 2.66 $ 2.44 (1) Diluted earnings per share assumes the redemption of all Accenture SCA Class I common shares owned by holders of noncontrolling interests and the exchange of all Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares, on a one-for-one basis. The income effect does not take into account Net income attributable to noncontrolling interestsother, since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares.
(2) Fiscal 2010 and 2009 diluted weighted average Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares and earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the impact of the issuance of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units in connection with the payment of cash dividends. This did not result in a change to previously reported Diluted earnings per share.
For fiscal 2011, there were no options excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise price would render them anti-dilutive. For fiscal 2010 and 2009, 110,294 and 193,143 options, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise prices would render them anti-dilutive.
F-15 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 3.REORGANIZATION AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS, NET Reorganization In fiscal 2001, the Company accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with its transition to a corporate structure. These liabilities included certain non-income tax liabilities, such as stamp taxes, as well as liabilities for certain individual income tax exposures related to the transfer of interests in certain entities to the Company as part of the reorganization. These primarily represent unusual and disproportionate individual income tax exposures assumed by certain, but not all, of the Companys shareholders and partners in certain tax jurisdictions specifically related to the transfer of their partnership interests in certain entities to the Company as part of the reorganization. (Prior to fiscal 2005, the Company referred to its highest-level employees with the partner title and the Company continues to use the term partner to refer to these persons in certain situations related to its reorganization and the period prior to its incorporation.) The Company identified certain shareholders and partners who may incur such unusual and disproportionate financial damage in certain jurisdictions. These include shareholders and partners who were subject to tax in their jurisdiction on items of income arising from the reorganization transaction that were not taxable for most other shareholders and partners. In addition, certain other shareholders and partners were subject to a different rate or amount of tax than other shareholders or partners in the same jurisdiction. When additional taxes are assessed on these shareholders or partners in connection with these transfers, the Company has made and intends to make payments, and in one country has contractually committed, to reimburse certain costs associated with the assessment either to the shareholder or partner, or to the taxing authority. The Company has recorded reorganization expense and the related liability where such liabilities are probable. Interest accruals are made to cover reimbursement of interest on such tax assessments.
The Companys reorganization activity was as follows: Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 Reorganization liability, beginning of period $ 271,907 $ 296,104 $ 308,694 Final determinations(1)  (1,999 ) (23,479 ) Changes in estimates   7,297 Benefits recorded  (1,999 ) (16,182 ) Interest expense accrued 1,520 11,537 12,889 Payments (3,873 )   Foreign currency translation adjustments 37,732 (33,735 ) (9,297 ) Reorganization liability, end of period $ 307,286 $ 271,907 $ 296,104 (1) Includes final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations.
As of August31, 2011, reorganization liabilities of $294,798 were included in Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months, and reorganization liabilities of $12,488 were included in Other non-current liabilities. Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and/or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution. Final resolution, through settlement, conclusion of legal proceedings or a tax authoritys decision not to pursue a claim, will result in payment by the Company of F-16 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) amounts in settlement or judgment of these matters and/or recording of a reorganization benefit or cost in the Companys Consolidated Income Statement. It is possible the aggregate amount of such payments in connection with resolution of all such proceedings could exceed the currently recorded amounts. As of August31, 2011, only a small number of jurisdictions remain that have active audits/investigations or open statutes of limitations, and only one is significant (which is the country referenced above). In that country, current and former partners, and the Company, are engaged in disputes with tax authorities in connection with the corporate reorganization in 2001, some of which have resulted, and others of which are expected to result, in litigation. These individuals and the Company intend to vigorously defend their positions.
Restructuring The Company recognized restructuring costs of $252,566in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs included $110,338 principally related to global consolidation of office space and $142,228 related to realignment of the Companys workforce, primarily at the senior executive level. The restructuring costs were allocated to the reportable operating segments as follows: $49,192to Communications& High Tech; $53,155 to Financial Services; $45,818 to Health& Public Service; $58,091 to Products; and $46,310 to Resources. The restructuring liabilities as of August31, 2011 were $71,250, of which $17,815 was included in Other accrued liabilities and $53,435 was included in Other non-current liabilities. The restructuring liabilities as of August31, 2010 were $94,558, of which $28,574 was included in Other accrued liabilities and $65,984 was included in Other non-current liabilities. The remaining liabilities represent the net present value of estimated obligations for operating leases on abandoned office space.
4.ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS The components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss were as follows: August31, 2011 2010 Net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges, net of tax of $19,960 and $2,139, respectively $ 32,354 $ 4,340 Net unrealized losses on marketable securities (984 ) (769 ) Foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax of $10,228 and $4,510, respectively 147,770 (44,638 ) Defined benefit plans, net of tax of $(182,427) and $(201,754), respectively (313,520 ) (345,225 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (134,380 ) $ (386,292 ) F-17 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 5.PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT The components of Property and equipment, net were as follows: August31, 2011 2010 Buildings and land $ 3,807 $ 3,321 Computers, related equipment and software 1,440,514 1,336,357 Furniture and fixtures 322,888 300,914 Leasehold improvements 657,987 578,715 Property and equipment, gross 2,425,196 2,219,307 Total accumulated depreciation (1,639,965 ) (1,559,738 ) Property and equipment, net $ 785,231 $ 659,569 6.BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL During fiscal 2011, the Company acquired the net assets of a provider of software solutions for the property and casualty insurance industry. In addition, during fiscal 2011, the Company completed four individually immaterial acquisitions. The total consideration for all fiscal 2011 acquisitions was $306,187. In connection with these acquisitions, the Company recorded combined goodwill of $254,975, a portion of which was allocated to each of the reportable segments. The Company also recorded $81,735 in intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships and intellectual property. The intangible assets are being amortized over a period of less than one to fifteen years. The pro forma effects on the Companys operations were not material.
During fiscal 2010, the Company completed several individually immaterial acquisitions and had no acquisitions in fiscal 2009.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Based on the results of its annual impairment analysis, the Company determined that no impairment existed as of August31, 2011 and 2010.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment were as follows: August31, 2009 Additions/ Adjustments Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments August31, 2010 Additions/ Adjustments Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments August31, 2011 Communications & High Tech $ 154,903 $ 1,438 $ (4,827 ) $ 151,514 $ 11,638 $ 10,715 $ 173,867 Financial Services 140,364 2,314 (1,446 ) 141,232 159,757 3,731 304,720 Health & Public Service 274,912 7,964 (2,330 ) 280,546 3,219 2,393 286,158 Products 182,442 15,122 (4,208 ) 193,356 71,185 14,388 278,929 Resources 72,531 1,169 886 74,586 9,195 4,536 88,317 Total $ 825,152 $ 28,007 $ (11,925 ) $ 841,234 $ 254,994 $ 35,763 $ 1,131,991 F-18 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 7.DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In the normal course of business, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. The Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statement.
Certain derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. Credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to the Company, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based on the gross fair value of all of the Companys derivative financial instruments, was approximately $79,243 as of August31, 2011.
The Company also utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. These provisions may reduce the Companys potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and reduce a counterpartys potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of the Company. Additionally, these agreements contain early termination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterpartys credit rating, thereby enabling the Company to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease the Companys realized loss on an open transaction. Similarly, a decrement in the Companys credit rating could trigger a counterpartys early termination rights, thereby enabling a counterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase the Companys realized loss on an open transaction. The aggregate fair value of the Companys derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position as of August31, 2011 was $20,570.
The Companys derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements. All of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets. Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing. For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash Flow Hedges Certain of the Companys subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of resources supplied by the Companys Global Delivery Network. To mitigate this risk, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future. The Company has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges. As of August31, 2011 and 2010, the Company held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment hedges.
In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative F-19 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) and the hedged item. The documentation includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedge item, the risk being hedged, the Companys risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. The Company assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges using the Hypothetical Derivative Method, which measures hedge ineffectiveness based on a comparison of the change in fair value of the actual derivative designated as the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative.The hypothetical derivative would have terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item.The Company measures and records hedge ineffectiveness at the end of each fiscal quarter.
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement and for fiscal 2011 and 2010 was not material. In addition, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges during fiscal 2011 or 2010.
The activity related to the change in net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows: Fiscal 2011 2010 Net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, net of tax, beginning of period $ 4,340 $ (10,575 ) Change in fair value, net of tax of $27,837 and $15,276, respectively 44,229 26,806 Reclassification adjustments into Cost of services, net of tax of $(8,276) and $(3,865), respectively (13,478 ) (9,959 ) Portion attributable to Noncontrolling interests, net of tax of $(1,741) and $(1,310), respectively (2,737 ) (1,932 ) Net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges, net of tax, end of period $ 32,354 $ 4,340 As of August31, 2011, $8,678 of the amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months.
Other Derivatives The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts, which have not been designated as hedges, to hedge balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany loans. These instruments are generally short-term in nature, with typical maturities of less than one year, and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives were a net gain of $112,118 and $29,574 for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. These net gains were offset by net foreign currency losses, including net losses related to the underlying balance sheet exposures, andare recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statement.
F-20 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows: August31, 2011 2010 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 21,714 $ 10,806 Other non-current assets 43,666 13,962 Other Derivatives Other current assets 13,863 4,422 Total assets $ 79,243 $ 29,190 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 4,649 $ 9,845 Other non-current liabilities 698 5,202 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 15,223 7,823 Total liabilities $ 20,570 $ 22,870 Total fair value $ 58,673 $ 6,320 Total notional value $ 4,127,456 $ 2,590,314 8.BORROWINGS AND INDEBTEDNESS As of August31, 2011, the Company had the following borrowing facilities: Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities Syndicated loan facility(1) $ 1,200,000 $  Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities(2) 480,090  Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit(3) 169,170  Total $ 1,849,260 $  (1) This facility, which matures on July31, 2012, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The Company continues to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of August31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no borrowings under the facility.
(2) The Company maintains separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local currency financing for the majority of the Companys operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of August31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no borrowings under these facilities.
(3) The Company also maintains local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access the Companys global facilities. As of August31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no borrowings under these various facilities.
F-21 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Under the borrowing facilities described above, the Company had an aggregate of $177,906 and $152,117 of letters of credit outstanding as of August31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, the Company also had total outstanding debt of $4,419 and $1,588 as of August31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The components of Income before income taxes were as follows: Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 U.S. sources $ 719,315 $ 526,721 $ 689,076 Non-U.S. sources 2,792,707 2,387,648 1,988,660 Total $ 3,512,022 $ 2,914,369 $ 2,677,736 F-22 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) The reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Companys effective income tax rate was as follows: Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % U.S. state and local taxes, net 0.9 0.9 1.2 Non-U.S. operations taxed at lower rates (14.6 ) (10.1 ) (10.0 ) Final determinations(1) (0.6 ) (1.1 ) (4.1 ) Other net activity in unrecognized tax benefits 4.8 2.5 3.4 Other, net 1.8 2.1 2.1 Effective income tax rate 27.3 % 29.3 % 27.6 % (1) Final determinations include final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of enacted changes in tax laws and tax rates did not have a material impact on the Companys effective tax rate.
The components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities included the following: August31, 2011 2010 Deferred tax assets: Pensions $ 229,963 $ 224,331 Revenue recognition 96,930 84,110 Compensation and benefits 379,597 336,572 Share-based compensation 232,508 280,509 Tax credit carryforwards 165,451 149,905 Net operating loss carryforwards 181,892 158,302 Depreciation and amortization 169,200 56,865 Indirect effects of unrecognized tax benefits 254,101 121,464 Other 54,106 54,485 1,763,748 1,466,543 Valuation allowance (246,667 ) (233,260 ) Total deferred tax assets 1,517,081 1,233,283 Deferred tax liabilities: Revenue recognition (29,689 ) (34,415 ) Depreciation and amortization (75,230 ) (44,866 ) Investments in subsidiaries (161,474 ) (137,229 ) Other (43,353 ) (26,167 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (309,746 ) (242,677 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 1,207,335 $ 990,606 F-23 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) The Company recorded valuation allowances of $246,667 and $233,260 as of August31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, against deferred tax assets principally associated with certain tax net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. For all other deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. During fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a net increase of $13,407 in the valuation allowance, primarily due to foreign currency translation.
The Company had net operating loss carryforwards as of August31, 2011 of $658,169. Of this amount, $68,159 expires between 2012 and 2017, $47,360 expires between 2018 and 2031, and $542,650 has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company had tax credit carryforwards as of August31, 2011 of $165,451, of which $60,572 will expire between 2012 and 2017, $24,302 will expire between 2018 and 2025, and $80,577 has an indefinite carryforward period.
As of August31, 2011, the Company had $1,645,831 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $805,186, if recognized, would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate. As of August31, 2010, the Company had $1,254,468 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $703,967, if recognized, would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate. The differences of $840,645 and $550,501, respectively, represent items recorded as adjustments to equity and offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: Fiscal 2011 2010 Balance, at beginning of period $ 1,254,468 $ 1,053,426 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 316,550 151,008 Additions for tax positions related to prior years 132,407 115,975 Reductions for tax positions related to prior years (77,072 ) (39,772 ) Statute of limitations expirations (8,056 ) (7,611 ) Settlements with tax authorities (7,000 ) (5,038 ) Cumulative translation adjustments 34,534 (13,520 ) Balance, at end of period $ 1,645,831 $ 1,254,468 For the year ended August31, 2010, substantially all of the additions for tax positions related to prior years are for items that had no net impact to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized approximately $73,016, $42,489 and $47,498 in interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $285,458 ($198,646, net of tax benefits) and $222,499 ($153,719, net of tax benefits) on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of August31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal 2003 to 2008. The Company is also currently under audit in numerous state and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. Although F-24 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, the Company does not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for the years before 2003. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $793,000 or increase by approximately $86,000 in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations and other adjustments. The majority of these amounts relate to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
As of August31, 2011, the Company had not recognized a deferred tax liability on $1,795,121 of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested. If such earnings were distributed, some countries may impose withholding taxes. It is not practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability.
Portions of the Companys operations are subject to reduced tax rates or are free of tax under various tax holidays which expire between fiscal 2012 and 2016. Some of the holidays are renewable at reduced levels, with renewal periods through 2026. The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be approximately $72,000, $71,000 and $78,000 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
10.RETIREMENT AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS Defined Benefit Pension In the United States and certain other countries, the Company maintains and administers defined benefit retirement plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees. In addition, the Companys U.S.defined benefit pension plans include a frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners, which is unfunded. Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan.
Certain postemployment benefits, including severance benefits, disability-related benefits and continuation of benefits, such as healthcare benefits and life insurance coverage, are provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. These costs are substantially provided for on an accrual basis.
Assumptions The Company uses an August31 measurement date for its U.S.and non-U.S.defined benefit pension plans. The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the fiscal year-end defined benefit pension obligations are as follows: August31, 2011 2010 U.S.Plans Non-U.S.
Plans U.S.Plans Non-U.S.
Plans Discount rate 5.25 % 4.99 % 5.25 % 4.77 % Rate of increase in future compensation 4.00 % 4.03 % 4.00 % 3.68 % F-25 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) The Companys methodology for selecting the discount rate for the U.S.Plans is to match the plans cash flows to that of the average of two yield curves that provide the equivalent yields on zero-coupon corporate bonds for each maturity. The discount rate assumption for the non-U.S.Plans primarily reflects the market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments. The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the Companys defined benefit pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns on defined benefit pension plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio.
Pension Expense Pension expense for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $110,332, $76,425 and $64,400 respectively.

The plans future prospects, their current financial conditions, the Companys current funding levels and other relevant factors suggest that the plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of return in order to achieve long-term objectives without undue risk to the plans ability to meet their current benefit obligations. The Company recognizes that asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plans assets is an important factor in determining long-term performance. Actual asset allocations at any point in time may vary from the target asset allocations and will be dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, required cash flows and investment decisions of the investment committee and the pension plans investment funds and managers. Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing.
Non-U.S. Pension Plans Plan assets in non-U.S.defined benefit pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation. The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers. In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with the Company. Asset allocation decisions are made to provide risk adjusted returns that align with the overall investment strategy for each plan. Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan. In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities. Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy. Defined benefit pension plans in certain countries are unfunded.
Risk Management Plan investments are exposed to certain risks including market, interest rate and operating risk. In order to mitigate significant concentrations of these risks, the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of equities and fixed income instruments. Equities are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds and are intended to achieve long term capital appreciation.To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets are allocated to debt securities which appropriately match the duration of individual plans liabilities. Plan asset allocation and investment managers guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis.

The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including the Companys own credit risk.
The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Companys market assumptions. The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:  Level 1Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;  Level 2Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets; and  Level 3Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.

Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements through which it may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby the Company has joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which the Company agrees to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third-party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.
Typically, the Company has contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company in connection with arrangements where third-party nonperformance has given rise to the clients claim. Payments by the Company under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim, which may be disputed by the Company typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.
As of August31, 2011 and 2010, the Companys aggregate potential liability to its clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $976,000 and $556,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $256,000 and $71,000, respectively, may be F-39 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) recovered from the other third parties if the Company is obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties that are the consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
To date, the Company has not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. The Company has assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believes that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole.
Legal Contingencies As of August31, 2011, the Company or its present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. The Company and/or its personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of its business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial condition.
16.SEGMENT REPORTING Operating segments are components of an enterprise where separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The Companys chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The Companys operating segments are managed separately because each operating segment represents a strategic business unit providing management consulting, technology and outsourcing services to clients in different industries.
