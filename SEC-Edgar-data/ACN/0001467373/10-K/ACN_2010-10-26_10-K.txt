Our delivery centers improve the efficiency of our engagement teams through the reuse of processes, solution designs, infrastructure and software and by leveraging the experience of delivery center professionals.
Professionals in our Global Delivery Network apply a systematic approach to delivering technology consulting, systems integration, application outsourcing and business processing outsourcing solutions and services delivery to create and capture proven, repeatable processes, methodologies, tools and architectures. For example, we continue to evolve our Accenture Delivery Suite, which combines our common methods, tools, architectures and metrics in support of our global delivery efforts. The Accenture Delivery Suite provides us with a common language, framework and reusable assets that allow us to unite our global delivery capabilities into a single, cohesive approach for our client service teamsenabling us to start projects quickly, deliver with high quality, and improve our ability to meet our clients expectations. In addition, our ability to build seamless global teamsleveraging the right professionals with the right skills for each taskenables us to provide a complete end-to-end capability, with consistent Accenture processes around the globe.
Our Global Delivery Network continues to be a competitive differentiator for us. In fiscal 2009 we increased our focus on industry capability, creating and extending industry centers of excellence across the network, and we launched a strategic industrialization program designed to enhance productivity and quality through automation, asset re-use and specialization of our people. As of August31, 2009, we had more than 81,000 people in our network globally.
12 Table of Contents Alliances We have sales and delivery alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own, either by, among other things, enhancing a service offering, delivering a new technology or helping us extend our services to new geographies. By combining our alliance partners products and services with our own capabilities and expertise, we create innovative, high-value business solutions for our clients. Some alliances are specifically aligned with one of our service lines, thereby adding skills, technology and insights that are applicable across many of the industries we serve. Other alliances extend and enhance our offerings specific to a single industry group. Almost all of our alliances are non-exclusive. These alliances can generate significant revenues from services to implement our alliance partners products. We also receive some direct payments, which are not material to our business, from our alliance partners as compensation for marketing, technical and other assistance.
Research and Innovation We are committed to developing leading-edge ideas, as we believe that both research and innovation have been major factors in our success and will help us continue to grow in the future. We use our investment in research and developmenton which we spent $435million, $390 million and $307 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectivelyto help create, commercialize and disseminate innovative business strategies and technology solutions.
Our research and innovation program is designed to generate early insights into how knowledge can be harnessed to create innovative business solutions for our clients and to develop business strategies with significant value. One component of this is our research and development organization, Accenture Technology Labs, which identifies and develops new technologies that we believe will be the drivers of our clients growth and enable them to be first to market with unique capabilities.
We also promote the creation of knowledge capital and thought leadership through the Accenture Institute for High Performance. In addition, we spend a significant portion of our research and development resources directly through our operating groups and our consulting, technology and outsourcing capabilities to develop market-ready solutions for our clients.
Employees Our most important asset is our people. The diverse and global makeup of our workforce enables us to serve our diverse and global client base. We are deeply committed to the continued development of our employees, who receive significant and focused technical, functional, industry, managerial and leadership skill development and training appropriate for their roles and levels within our company throughout their careers with us. We seek to reinforce our employees commitments to our clients, culture and values through a comprehensive performance management system and a career philosophy that rewards both individual performance and teamwork. We strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces our owner-operator culture and the collaboration, motivation, alignment of interests and sense of ownership and reward that this culture has fostered.
As of August31, 2009, we had approximately 177,000 employees worldwide.
Competition We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services competitive with those we offer. We compete with a variety of companies, including:  Off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly Indian providers, that offer services similar to those we offer, often at highly competitive prices; 13 Table of Contents  Large multinational providers, including the service arms of large global technology providers, that offer some or all of the services that we do;  Niche solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including companies that provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models; and  Accounting firms that are expanding or re-emphasizing their provision of consulting services.
In addition, a client may choose to use its own resources rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide.
Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, medium-sized companies, governments, government agencies and other enterprises. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include:  skills and capabilities of people;  innovative service and product offerings;  ability to add value;  reputation and client references;  price;  scope of services;  service delivery approach;  technical and industry expertise;  quality of services and solutions;  ability to deliver results on a timely basis;  availability of appropriate resources; and  global reach and scale.
Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis.
Intellectual Property Our success has resulted in part from our proprietary methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital, assets and other intellectual property rights. We rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements as well as upon trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property. We have promulgated policies related to confidentiality and ownership and to the use and protection of our intellectual property and that owned by third parties, and we also enter into agreements with our employees as appropriate.
We recognize the increasing value of intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously create, harvest and protect our intellectual property. As of August31, 2009, we had 2,080 patent applications pending in the United States and other jurisdictions and had been issued 393 U.S. patents and 318 non-U.S. patents in, among others, the following areas: Web visual navigation technology; healthcare solution frameworks; online banking models; line-item data processing; investor profile methodologies; marketing analytics; inventory management; location-based services; goal-based educational simulation; virtual call centers; hybrid telecommunications networks; development architecture frameworks; emotion- 14 Table of Contents based voice processing; mobile communications networks; location-based information filtering; and computerized multimedia asset systems. We intend to continue to vigorously identify, create, harvest and protect our intellectual property and to leverage our protected, differentiated assets and methodologies to provide superior value to our clients.
Organizational Structure On September1, 2009, Accenture Ltd completed a transaction in which Accenture plc, organized in Ireland, became the parent holding company of Accenture. This transaction is described below under History.
Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company with no material assets other than ClassII and ClassIII common shares in its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares (Accenture SCA). Accenture plcs only business is to hold these shares and the shares of its subsidiary Accenture Ltd, which is the sole general partner of Accenture SCA. Accenture plc owns a majority voting interest in Accenture SCA. As the parent company of the general partner of Accenture SCA and as a result of Accenture plcs majority voting interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc controls Accenture SCAs management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCAs results in its financial statements. We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture SCA. Accenture SCA generally reimburses Accenture plc for its expenses but does not pay Accenture plc any fees. We expect that Accenture plc will be elected the general partner of Accenture SCA in place of Accenture Ltd at the November16, 2009 shareholder meeting of Accenture SCA.
History Prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001, we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners. In connection with our transition to a corporate structure, our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares or, in the case of partners in certain countries, Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA. Generally, partners who received Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd ClassX common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights.
In fiscal 2005, we developed and announced a broader career model for our highest-level executives that recognizes the diversity of roles and responsibilities demonstrated by these employees. This career framework replaced the internal use of the partner title with the more comprehensive senior executive title and applies the senior executive title to our highest-level employees, including those previously referred to as partners. However, for proper context, we continue to use the term partner in certain situations and particularly when discussing our reorganization and the period prior to our incorporation.
On June10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction). On August5, 2009, the shareholders of Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, voted in favor of the Transaction. The Transaction was subsequently completed on September1, 2009, following approval from the Supreme Court of Bermuda, at which time Accenture Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company. In the Transaction, all of the outstanding ClassA and Class X common shares of Accenture Ltd were cancelled and Accenture plc issued ClassA and Class X ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the cancelled Accenture Ltd ClassA and Class X common shares, as applicable (and cash for any fractional shares).
15 Table of Contents ClassA ordinary shares of the Irish company, Accenture plc, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September1, 2009 under the symbol ACN, the same symbol under which ClassA common shares of Accenture Ltd, its predecessor, were previously listed. Prior to September1, 2009, the effective date of the Transaction, Accenture plc was a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture Ltd and had no substantive operating activity.
The financial statements included in this report reflect the consolidated operations of Accenture Ltd (the predecessor registrant of Accenture plc) and its subsidiaries.
Accenture plc ClassA and ClassX Ordinary Shares Each ClassA ordinary share and each ClassX ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc. A holder of a ClassX ordinary share is not, however, entitled to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc.
Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any ClassX ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the ClassX ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share. Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture CanadaHoldings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any ClassX ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of ClassX ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder. Accenture plc will redeem ClassX ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of ClassX ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. ClassX ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.
A transfer of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. Other transfers of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the ClassA ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer.
Accenture SCA ClassI Common Shares Only our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees hold Accenture SCA ClassI common shares. Each ClassI common share entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to the shareholders of Accenture SCA and entitles its holder to dividends and liquidation payments.
Accenture SCA is obligated, at the option of the holder, to redeem any outstanding Accenture SCA ClassI common share at any time at a redemption price per share generally equal to its current market value as determined in accordance with Accenture SCAs Articles of Association. Under Accenture SCAs Articles of Association, the market value of a ClassI common share that is not subject to transfer restrictions will be deemed to be equal to (i)the average of the high and low sales prices of an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other designated market on which the ClassA ordinary shares trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs, or (ii)if Accenture plc sells its ClassA ordinary shares on the date that the redemption price is determined (other than in a transaction with any employee or an affiliate or pursuant to a preexisting obligation), the weighted average sales price of an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other market on which the ClassA ordinary shares primarily trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs. Accenture SCA may, at its option, pay this redemption price with cash or by delivering Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. This 16 Table of Contents one-for-one redemption price and exchange ratio will be adjusted if Accenture plc holds more than a de minimis amount of assets (other than its interest in Accenture SCA and assets it holds only transiently prior to contributing them to Accenture SCA) or incurs more than a de minimis amount of liabilities (other than liabilities for which Accenture SCA has a corresponding liability to Accenture plc). We have been advised by our legal advisors in Luxembourg that there is no relevant legal precedent in Luxembourg quantifying or defining the term de minimis.
In the event that a question arises in this regard, we expect that management will interpret de minimis in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time in question. At this time, Accenture plc does not intend to hold any material assets other than its interest in Accenture SCA or to incur any material liabilities such that this one-for-one redemption price and exchange ratio would require adjustment and will disclose any change in its intentions that could affect this ratio. In order to maintain Accenture plcs economic interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc generally will acquire additional Accenture SCA common shares each time additional Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares are issued.
Except in the case of a redemption of ClassI common shares or a transfer of ClassI common shares to Accenture plc or one of its subsidiaries, Accenture SCAs Articles of Association provide that Accenture SCA ClassI common shares may be transferred only with the consent of the general partner of Accenture SCA. In addition, all holders of ClassI common shares are precluded from having their shares redeemed by Accenture SCA or transferred to Accenture SCA, Accenture plc or a subsidiary of Accenture plc at any time or during any period when Accenture SCA determines, based on the advice of counsel, that there is material non-public information that may affect the average price per share of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares, if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law, during an underwritten offering due to an underwriters lock-up or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by Accenture SCA or its affiliates for Accenture SCA ClassI common shares until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer (other than to tender the holders Accenture SCA ClassI common shares in the tender offer).
Accenture SCA ClassII and ClassIII Common Shares On June28, 2005, Accenture SCAs shareholders approved certain amendments to the rights of Accenture SCA ClassII common shares held by Accenture Ltd, as well as the creation of a new class of common shares known as ClassIII common shares into which all ClassI common shares held by Accenture Ltd and its affiliates were reclassified. All ClassI common shares sold or otherwise transferred to Accenture plc or its subsidiaries are automatically reclassified into ClassIII common shares.
The amendments to the ClassII common shares, the creation of ClassIII common shares (and all lettered sub-series of that class) and the reclassification of all ClassI common shares held or to be held by Accenture plc and its subsidiaries have no effect on the computation of Accenture plcs earnings per share.
Accenture SCA ClassII common shares and ClassIII common shares (or any lettered sub-series of that class) are not entitled to any cash dividends. If the Board of Directors of Accenture plc authorizes the payment of a cash dividend on Accenture plcs ClassA ordinary shares, the general partner of Accenture SCA will cause Accenture SCA to redeem ClassII common shares and ClassIII common shares that Accenture plc holds to obtain cash needed to pay dividends on its ClassA ordinary shares. At any time that Accenture SCA pays a cash dividend on its ClassI common shares, new ClassII common shares and ClassIII common shares will be issued to the existing holders of ClassII common shares and ClassIII common shares, in each case having an aggregate value of the amount of any cash dividends that the holders of those ClassII or ClassIII common shares would have received had they ratably participated in the cash dividend paid on the ClassI common shares.
17 Table of Contents Each ClassII common share entitles its holder to receive a liquidation payment equal to 10% of any liquidation payment to which a ClassI common share entitles its holder. Each Accenture SCA ClassIII common share entitles its holder to receive a liquidation payment equal to 100% of any liquidation payment to which an Accenture SCA ClassI common share entitles its holder.
Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share entitles its holder.
ITEM1A.RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
Our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity.
Global economic and political conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve. The global economic downturn in fiscal 2009 has reduced, and may further reduce, demand for our services and has also caused clients to request additional price concessions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If current global economic conditions continue or worsen, or if economic contraction continues in the industries or geographies where we operate, our business could be adversely affected by our clients financial condition and the levels of business activity in the industries we serve. Changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected.
Our results of operations could be negatively affected if we cannot expand and develop our services and solutions in response to changes in technology and client demand.
Our success depends on our ability to develop and implement consulting, systems integration and technology, and outsourcing services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry developments and client needs. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis, and our offerings may not be successful in the marketplace. Implementing new services or solutions for our clients may entail more risk than supplying existing offerings. Also, services, solutions and technologies offered by current or future competitors may make our service or solution offerings uncompetitive or obsolete. Any one of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain or successfully deliver client work.
18 Table of Contents The consulting, systems integration and technology, and outsourcing markets are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
The consulting, systems integration and technology, and outsourcing markets are highly competitive. We compete with a variety of companies, including:  Off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly Indian providers, that offer services similar to those we offer, often at highly competitive prices;  Large multinational providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers, that offer some or all of the services that we do;  Niche solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including companies that provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models;and  Accounting firms that are expanding or re-emphasizing their provision of consulting services.
In addition, a client may choose to use its own resources rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide.
Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing or other resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals. Additionally, some of our competitors, particularly those located in regions with lower costs of doing business, may be able to provide services and solutions at lower cost or on terms more attractive to clients than we can, particularly in the outsourcing and systems integration markets. There is a risk that increased competition could put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and on our operating margins. Similarly, if our competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity, they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins. Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, our competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are Accenture clients. If we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices, our results of operations may suffer.
In addition, we may face greater competition from companies that have increased in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers or acquisitions. These transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers, software developers and vendors, and service providers. The result of this vertical integration may be greater convergence of products and services that were once offered separately by independent vendors. Our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this industry trend, which could adversely affect our competitive position.
Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities. Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:  Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, the government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits or shortfalls, could result in our projects being reduced in scope or terminated altogether.
Government entities, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency in the United States, periodically audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, and conduct system 19 Table of Contents reviews, investigations and other inquires of our business practices with respect to our government contracts. If the government auditors find that the costs are not reimbursable, then we will not be allowed to bill for them, or the cost must be refunded to the client if it has already been paid to us. Findings from an audit also may result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed rates for our work, may affect our future margins or may prevent us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time.
If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities, regardless of their adequacy. An allegation of improper activity, even if not proven, could result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation and business.
U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations. Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of credible evidence of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government. Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level. Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
Government contracts, and the proceedings surrounding them, are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than contracts with commercial clients. Negative publicity related to our government contracts, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts.
Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed.
Terms and conditions of government contracts tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate than those for commercial contracts.
The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies. Additionally, because of their visibility and political nature, government projects may present a heightened risk to our reputation. Either of these could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.
Our business could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our services.
Our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients, including a significant amount procured on a sole-source basis. Our business model also depends on relationships our senior executives develop with our clients so that we can understand our clients needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs. If a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us, a subcontractor or other third parties who provide services or products for a specific project, or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the clients dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client. In 20 Table of Contents particular, clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors. In addition, negative publicity related to our client services or relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients.
Our results of operations could be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts with us.
Many of our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive, project-by-project basis. Although we do not centrally track the termination provisions of our consulting contracts, we estimate that the majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice. Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12months in duration, and these shorter-duration contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30days notice and without significant cost. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated profits lost upon termination of the contract. Additionally, large client projects often involve multiple contracts or stages, and a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work.
Terminations, cancellations or delays could result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project, including the business or financial conditions of the client, changes in ownership or management at our clients, changes in client strategies or the economy or markets generally. When contracts are terminated, we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to replace the lost revenue with other work or eliminate associated costs in a timely manner. There is a risk we could experience a significant number of terminations. Consequently, our revenues and/or profit margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected.
Outsourcing services are a significant part of our business and subject us to operational and financial risk.
We earned approximately 42% of our net revenues in fiscal 2009 from our outsourcing services. This portion of our business presents potential operational and financial risks that are different from those of our consulting and systems integration services. Our outsourcing services involve taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients businesses. In some cases, we may deliver those services using client personnel and third-party contracts that are transferred to us. Occasionally, however, we assume responsibility for delivering our services using client personnel or client subcontractors who are not transferred to us, and we therefore have less ability to fully control their work and efforts. In addition, we could incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations related to the portions of our clients businesses that are transferred to us.
This type of work also presents financial risks to us. Outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts, particularly during the first year of the contract. This could exert downward pressure on our overall gross margins, particularly during the early stages of new outsourcing contracts, which might not be offset by improved performance on contracts in our portfolio that we have been operating for a longer time. Furthermore, we face considerable competition for outsourcing work and our clients are increasingly using intensive contracting processes and aggressive contracting techniques and terms, sometimes assisted by third-party advisors.
21 Table of Contents Our results of operations may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our clients.
Our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their customers and suppliers. In challenging economic environments, our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities. At the same time, many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information, and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel, processes and infrastructures. If the growth of use of technology in business or our clients spending on technology in business declines or if our clients or potential clients do not embrace new technology solutions, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates.
Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is dependent on the rates we are able to charge for our services. If we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services, our profit margin and our profitability could suffer. The rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including:  our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services;  competition;  our clients desire to reduce their costs;  introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors;  our competitors pricing policies;  our ability to charge higher prices where market demand or the value of our services justifies it;  our ability to accurately estimate, attain and sustain contract revenues, margins and cash flows over long contract periods;  procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors;  aggressive use by our competitors of off-shore resources to provide lower-cost service delivery capabilities;and  general economic and political conditions.
Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain a favorable utilization rate.
The cost of providing our services, including the utilization rate of our professionals, affects our profitability. Our utilization rate is affected by a number of factors, including:  our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments and to hire and assimilate new employees;  our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain headcount in each of our geographies and workforces that is effectively aligned with demand;  our ability to manage attrition;and  our need to devote time and resources to training, business development and other non-chargeable activities.
If our utilization rate is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition. If our utilization rate is too low, our profit margin and profitability could suffer.
22 Table of Contents Our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our solutions and services.
If we fail to meet our contractual obligations, fail to disclose our financial or other arrangements with our alliance partners or otherwise breach obligations to clients, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them, we could be subject to legal liability. We may enter into non-standard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines. In addition, the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace. We may find ourselves committed to providing services that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will cause us financial loss. If we cannot or do not perform our obligations, we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope of our potential liability. If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide solutions and services, and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, we might face significant legal liability and our business could be adversely affected.
If our pricing structures do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our work, then our contracts could be unprofitable.
We negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures. Our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace, which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects, our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated. This also applies to outsourcing contracts, as many of these projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations utilizing workforces with different skillsets. Furthermore, on outsourcing work we occasionally hire employees from our clients and assume responsibility for one or more of our clients business processes. Our pricing, cost and profit margin estimates on outsourcing work frequently include anticipated long-term cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the outsourcing contract. There is a risk that we will underprice our contracts, fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts. This could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our profit margin.
Many of our contracts utilize performance pricing that links some of our fees to the attainment of various performance or business targets. This could increase the variability of our revenues and margins.
Many of our contracts include performance clauses that require us to achieve agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could reduce our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms. Additionally, we have a number of contracts, many of which are outsourcing contracts, in which a portion of our fees or incentives depends on factors such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend in some measure on our clients actual levels of business activity. These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.
Our alliance relationships may not be successful.
We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own. See BusinessAlliances. As most of our alliance relationships are non-exclusive, our alliance partners are not 23 Table of Contents prohibited from forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors. Loss of or limitations on our relationships with them could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our global operations are subject to complex risks, some of which might be beyond our control.
We have offices and operations in 52 countries around the world and provide services to clients in more than 120 countries. In fiscal 2009, approximately 44% of our net revenues were attributable to the Americas region, 46% were attributable to the Europe, Middle East and Africa region (EMEA), and 10% were attributable to the Asia Pacific region. In addition, our Global Delivery Network comprises local Accenture professionals working at client sites around the world as well as more than 50 delivery centers. If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations, including fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates, international hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters, security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Although we report our operating results in U.S.dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S.dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us.
Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S.dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S.dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items originally denominated in other currencies. Declines in the value of other currencies against the U.S.dollar could cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S.dollars to be lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods. Conversely, increases in the value of other currencies against the U.S.dollar could cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S.dollars to be higher than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods. There is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
In some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which could limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations.
As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services. An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee, against the U.S.dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency, and there can be no assurance that our contractual provisions or our currency hedging activities would offset this impact. This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources.
International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our operating results.
Acts of terrorist violence, armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, natural disasters, global health risks or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us. These events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations 24 Table of Contents around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients. By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients. Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients. While we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences, we might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars. If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our operating results could be adversely affected.
We could incur liability or our reputation could be damaged if our provision of services and solutions to our clients contributes to our clients internal control deficiencies.
Our clients may request that we provide an audit of control activities we perform for them when we host or process data belonging to them. Our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion, or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion in a timely manner. Additionally, we could incur liability if a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures or impair our clients ability to comply with its own internal control requirements.
Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.
We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, government affairs, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and labor relations. Violations of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations. Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights.
Legislation related to certain non-U.S.corporations has been enacted in various jurisdictions in the United States, none of which adversely affects Accenture. However, additional legislative proposals remain under consideration which, if enacted, could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States in the future. Changes in laws and regulations applicable to foreign corporations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions, such as preventing us from using off-shore resources to provide our services, or could impose additional taxes on the provision of our services and solutions. These changes could threaten our ability to continue to serve certain markets.
In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations, including the U.S.Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these policies or procedures or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines and suspension or disqualification from U.S.federal contracting, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
25 Table of Contents We could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we do not protect client data or information systems or if our information systems are breached.
We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners and clients. Security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We are also required at times to manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data. As a result, we are subject to numerous U.S.and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the European Union Directive on Data Protection and various U.S.federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, could result in negative publicity, legal liability and damage to our reputation.
Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to control our costs.
Our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency affects our profitability. In an environment of continuing pricing pressure, we may be forced to permanently adjust our pricing policies and delivery capabilities, and our profitability may be impaired if we cannot sustain or improve our cost management efforts. Our short-term cost reduction initiatives, which focus primarily on reducing variable costs, might not be sufficient to deal with all pressures on our pricing. Our long-term cost-reduction initiatives, which focus on global reductions in costs for service delivery and infrastructure, rely upon our successful introduction and coordination of multiple geographic and skill-based workforces and a growing number of geographically distributed delivery centers. If we are unable to control our costs or improve our efficiency, our profitability could be negatively affected.
If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.
Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand. We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients and grow our business. We are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers with the skill sets required by our business, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized. Similarly, the profitability of our business model depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects. The processes and costs associated with recruiting, training and retaining employees place significant demands on our resources.
There is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds we require. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain of our labor needs. Additionally, if demand were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profit margins. At other times, however, we may have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies. In these situations, we must evaluate voluntary attrition and use increased involuntary terminations and reduced levels of new hiring as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in 26 Table of Contents balance with client demand. Our profits and ability to compete for and manage client engagements could be adversely affected if we cannot manage employee hiring, attrition and severance to achieve an efficient workforce structure.
We could be subject to liabilities if our subcontractors or the third parties with whom we partner cannot deliver their project contributions on time or at all.
Large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers. Our ability to serve our clients and deliver and implement our solutions in a timely manner depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, profitability or cash flow.
If we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed. We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. In limited circumstances, we also extend financing to our clients. We maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services. Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. Recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.
Our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.
We cannot be sure that our services and solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and we could have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients. These claims could harm our reputation, cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions. In a number of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client. Any claims or litigation in this area, whether we ultimately win or lose, could be time-consuming and costly, injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. We might not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms. If a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients, an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages.
27 Table of Contents We could lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others. Third-party suppliers of software, hardware or other intellectual assets could be acquired or sued, and this could disrupt use of their products or services by Accenture and our clients. If our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired, our operating results could be adversely affected.
We have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success.
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property. Existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations. Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight.
Depending on the circumstances, we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do. In certain situations, we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create, which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients. Any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects.
Legislative or regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us.
Changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable and could adversely affect our tax position. Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the U.S. and Ireland, there are pending U.S. legislative proposals which could override such treaty, and which could subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. Similarly, Congressional proposals could change the circumstances under which we would be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could also subject us to increased taxation. In addition, we could be adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with the United States.
Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States. While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be enacted in a way to affect Accenture.
We may be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
There has been negative publicity regarding, and criticism of, companies that conduct business in the United States but are domiciled in certain other countries. While we were never a U.S. company, some former U.S. companies that have undertaken expatriation transactions to offshore jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over U.S. companies. We could be subject to similar criticism in connection with our incorporation in Ireland.
28 Table of Contents If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
As of August31, 2009, we had approximately 177,000employees worldwide. Our size presents significant management and organizational challenges. It takes time for our newer employees to develop the knowledge, skills and experience that our business model requires. It is difficult to maintain common standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our know-how. In addition, it can be difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage our personnel and operations and effectively communicate to our personnel worldwide our core values, strategies and goals. Finally, the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that an employee will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired.
We may not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating other businesses or technologies.
We expect to continue our program of pursuing strategic acquisitions designed to enhance our capabilities. However, there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired financial or operating results. Furthermore, we face numerous risks in integrating any businesses we might acquire. We might need to dedicate additional management and other resources to complete the transactions. Our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses or technologies into our ongoing operations and assimilate employees of those businesses into our culture and operations. Accordingly, we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we undertake. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.
Consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business.
Companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations, it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients. If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting, systems integration and technology, or outsourcing services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work. The increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us. Any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business.
Our ability to attract and retain business may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
Our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors. Since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions, our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients evaluation of whether to engage our services. We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients, competitors, vendors, adversaries in legal proceedings, 29 Table of Contents government regulators, as well as members of the investment community and the media. There is a risk that negative information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. In particular, damage to our reputation could be difficult and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, adversely affecting our share price.
Our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate, including in response to variability in revenues, operating results and profitability, and as a result our share price could be difficult to predict.
Our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors. These factors include:  announcements by us or our competitors about developments in our business or prospects;  projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts;  changes in macroeconomic or political factors unrelated to our business;  general or industry-specific market conditions or changes in financial markets;and  changes in our revenues, operating results and profitability.
Our revenues, operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, making them difficult to predict. Some of the factors that could cause our revenues, operating results and profitability to vary include:  the business decisions of our clients to curtail or reduce the use of our services, including in response to economic conditions;  seasonality, including number of workdays and holiday and summer vacations;  periodic differences between our clients estimated and actual levels of business activity associated with ongoing work;  the stage of completion of existing projects and/or their termination;  our ability to transition employees quickly from completed to new projects;  the introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;  our ability to manage costs, including those for personnel, travel, support services and severance;  our ability to maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our workforces;  acquisition and integration costs related to possible acquisitions of other businesses;  changes in, or the application of changes in, accounting principles or pronouncements under U.S.generally accepted accounting principles, particularly those related to revenue recognition;  currency exchange rate fluctuations;  changes in estimates, accruals or payments of variable compensation to our employees;and  global, regional and local economic and political conditions and related risks, including acts of terrorism.
30 Table of Contents As a result of any of these factors, our share price could be difficult to predict and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future. In addition, if litigation is instituted against us following variability in our share price, we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation, and our share price could be adversely affected.
Our share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.
The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations, and the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected.
We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.
We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S.federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S.courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. The laws of Ireland do however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts. Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the United States judgment. The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction and the judgment may not be recognized if it is based on public policy, was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy. Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice would not be enforced in Ireland. Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Acts 1963 to 2009 of Ireland (the Companies Acts). The Companies Acts differ in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S.corporations and shareholders 31 Table of Contents under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.
Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances. Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company. Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries. If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.
We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders ownership interest in us.
We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:  take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion;  acquire other businesses or technologies;  repurchase shares from our shareholders;  develop new services and solutions;or  respond to competitive pressures.
Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders ownership percentage in us. Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
ITEM1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
ITEM2.PROPERTIES We have major offices in the worlds leading business centers, including New York, London, Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid, Chicago, Milan, Tokyo, Sao Paolo, Rome, Bangalore, SanFrancisco, Sydney, Manila and Boston, among others. In total, we have offices and operations in more than 200cities in 52 countries around the world. We do not own any material real property. Substantially all of our office space is leased under long-term leases with varying expiration dates. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs in the near future.
ITEM3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are involved in a number of judicial and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of our business. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. We do not expect that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
As previously reported, in September 2007, the State of Connecticut filed an action in State Superior Court in Hartford against Accenture arising out of an alleged data security breach. The action arose in 32 Table of Contents connection with work we undertook for the State of Connecticuts Office of the Comptroller. In July 2009, Accenture and the State entered into a settlement of the lawsuit under which Accenture agreed to provide a cash payment and consulting services at no cost to the State in exchange for a release and dismissal with prejudice of the States lawsuit. This settlement did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
As previously reported, in April 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ) intervened in a civil qui tam action previously filed under seal by two private individuals in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas against Accenture and several of its indirect subsidiaries. The complaint as amended alleges that, in connection with work we undertook for the U.S. federal government, we received payments, resale revenue or other benefits as a result of, or otherwise acted improperly in connection with, alliance agreements we maintain with technology vendors and others in violation of our contracts with the U.S. government and/or applicable law or regulations. Similar suits were brought against other companies in our industry. The suit alleges that these amounts and relationships were not disclosed to the government in violation of the Federal False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Act, among other statutes. The DOJ complaint seeks various remedies including treble damages, statutory penalties and disgorgement of profits. While the complaint does not allege damages with specificity, the amount sought by the DOJ will depend on the theories it pursues, and could be significant. The suit could lead to other related proceedings and actions by various agencies of the U.S. government, including potential suspension or debarment, or criminal, proceedings. The DOJ is currently conducting an additional investigation regarding certain of the alleged conduct and relationships at issue in the suit and we are cooperating with the DOJ in that investigation. We intend to defend such matters vigorously and do not believe they will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
As previously reported, in July 2003, we became aware of an incident of possible noncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and/or with Accentures internal controls in connection with certain of our operations in the Middle East. In 2003, we voluntarily reported the incident to the appropriate authorities in the United States promptly after its discovery. Shortly thereafter, the SEC advised us it would be undertaking an informal investigation of this incident, and the DOJ indicated it would also conduct a review. Since that time, there have been no further developments. We do not believe that this incident will have any material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
We currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate, including coverage for professional liability, general liability and management liability. We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct.

We use the terms Accenture, we, our Company, our and us in this report to refer to Accenture plc, an Irish public limited company, and its subsidiaries or, prior to September1, 2009, to Accenture Ltd, a Bermuda exempted company that, on that date, became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc, and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August31. For example, a reference to fiscal 2009 means the 12-month period that ended on August31, 2009. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
Overview Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, credit market conditions and levels of business confidence. Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges. We add value to clients and drive revenues based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
The global economic downturn in fiscal 2009 was widespread, leading to economic contraction in many industries and geographies where we operate. It also impacted the needs of our clients and the revenues in our consulting and outsourcing businesses. These changing demand patterns have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our new contract bookings and revenue growth, compared to the prior fiscal year.
Revenues before reimbursements (net revenues) for fiscal 2009 were $21.58 billion, compared with $23.39 billion in fiscal 2008, a decrease of 8% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. Net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $5.15 billion, compared with $6.00 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, a decrease of 14% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency.
40 Table of Contents In our consulting business, net revenues for fiscal 2009 were $12.56 billion, compared with $14.12 billion for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 11% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency. Consulting net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $2.91 billion, compared with $3.61 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, a decrease of 19% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. Starting in January 2009, the global economic downturn led to lower current demand for new consulting services. Many clients are focused on initiatives designed to deliver near- and medium-term cost savings and performance improvement. Some clients continue to exercise caution and to seek flexibility in launching new large consulting commitments and instead have shifted to a more phased approach to contracting work. Certain clients have slowed the pace of on-going projects and/or have deferred decisions to expand scope beyond current commitments. In addition, we are experiencing pricing pressures from some clients and in response, where practicable, have shifted to lower-cost resources at reduced price levels, particularly in our systems integration business.
In our outsourcing business, net revenues for fiscal 2009 were $9.02 billion, compared with $9.27 billion for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 3% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 6% in local currency. Outsourcing net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $2.23 billion, compared with $2.39 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, a decrease of 7% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 1% in local currency. In response to clients seeking to reduce operating costs with requests for price concessions and more favorable contract terms, we have shifted and expect to continue to shift to lower-cost resources at a reduced price level. In addition, we have experienced a lower volume of scope expansions on existing contracts. Client strategy changes and consolidations have also resulted in more contract terminations and restructuring, primarily in Financial Services, and to a lesser extent in Communications & High Tech and Resources.
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations. During the majority of fiscal 2008, the U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation and greater reported U.S. dollar revenues. However, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the U.S. dollar began to strengthen against many currencies and this trend continued until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The foreign-exchange impact on our full fiscal 2009 revenue growth was approximately 8% lower growth in U.S. dollars, compared to our growth in local currency. In the future, if the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, our revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower than our growth in local currency. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, our revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher than our growth in local currency.
The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, sub-contractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with the growth of new outsourcing contracts. Utilization represents the percentage of our professionals time spent on billable consulting work. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was approximately 86%, an increase from 83% for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, and was at the top of the range we expected. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was approximately 84%. Sales and marketing expense is driven primarily by compensation costs for business-development activities, the development of new service offerings and client-targeting, image-development and brand-recognition activities. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space, which we seek to manage, as a percentage of revenues, at levels consistent with or lower than levels in prior-year periods.
Operating expenses in fiscal 2009 also included restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter. These costs included $111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and 41 Table of Contents $142 million related to realignment of our workforce, primarily at the senior-executive level, to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future. Restructuring costs are reflected in operating expenses, along with reorganization costs and benefits, which may vary substantially from year to year. Reorganization costs and benefits were immaterial in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was 32.3%, compared with 31.7% for fiscal 2008. Gross margin for fiscal 2009 was 31.7%, compared with 30.7% for fiscal 2008. The increase for both periods was driven primarily by improved overall outsourcing contract profitability.
Our cost-management strategies include anticipating changes in demand for our services and executing cost-management initiatives. In addition to the workforce actions included in the Restructuring costs, we aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs and take on-going actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have reduced our headcount to approximately 177,000 as of August31, 2009, compared with more than 186,000 as of August31, 2008. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for fiscal 2009 was 10%, compared to 16% for fiscal 2008. We evaluate voluntary attrition and have used increased involuntary terminations and reduced levels of new hiring as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand. Our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to manage headcount, attrition and severance costs, recover increases in compensation and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.
Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 18.3% for fiscal 2009, compared with 17.7% for fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due to an increase in selling costs as a percentage of net revenues and a bad debt provision of $75 million, or 0.3% of net revenues. This provision reflects our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables, in light of the current global economic conditions, particularly from clients in high-risk industries or with potential liquidity issues.
Operating income for fiscal 2009 was $2,644 million, compared with $3,012 million for fiscal 2008. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for fiscal 2009 was 12.3%, compared with 12.9% for fiscal 2008. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was $420 million, compared with $785 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was 8.2%, compared with 13.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2009 increased 50 basis points compared with fiscal 2008.
Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Due to the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many other currencies, this impact was unfavorable during fiscal 2009. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues. Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for Net revenues. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements.
42 Table of Contents Bookings and Backlog New contract bookings for fiscal 2009 were $23.90 billion, with consulting bookings of $12.78 billion and outsourcing bookings of $11.12 billion. New contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $5.54 billion, with consulting bookings of $2.87 billion and outsourcing bookings of $2.68 billion.
We provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. However, new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. New contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New contract bookings are recorded using then-existing currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for currency fluctuations.
The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice or without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.
Revenue Recognition Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require Accenture to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.
We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Estimated revenues for applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or 43 Table of Contents decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities. Contract loss provisions recorded as of August, 31, 2009 and 2008 are immaterial.
Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB101), as amended by SABNo.104, Revenue Recognition (SAB104). We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SAB101, as amended by SAB104. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs.
Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
44 Table of Contents Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the elements relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.
Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.
Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.
We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with FIN48, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.
45 Table of Contents No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long- term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.
As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.
Revenues by Segment/Operating Group Our five reportable operating segments in fiscal 2009 were our operating groups, which were Communications& High Tech, Financial Services, Products, Public Service and Resources. For presentation purposes, all discussions and operating group financial results relating to periods through the end of our 2009 fiscal year on August31, 2009 refer to the historical stand-alone Public Service operating group, exclusive of the payer and provider components of the Health& Life Sciences industry group, which were included in our Products operating group in fiscal 2009. Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.
From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.
46 Table of Contents While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.
47 Table of Contents Results of Operations for Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net revenues (by operating group, geography and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Year Ended August31, Percent (Decrease) Increase US$ Percent (Decrease) Increase Local Currency Percent of Total Net Revenues for the Year Ended August31, 2009 2008 2009 2008 (in millions) OPERATING GROUPS Communications& High Tech $ 4,831 $ 5,450 (11 )% (4 )% 22 % 23 % Financial Services 4,323 5,005 (14 ) (6 ) 20 22 Products 5,530 6,069 (9 ) (1 ) 26 26 Public Service 2,984 2,871 4 11 14 12 Resources 3,880 3,963 (2 ) 8 18 17 Other 29 29 n/m n/m   TOTAL Net Revenues 21,577 23,387 (8 )%  100 % 100 % Reimbursements 1,594 1,927 (17 ) TOTAL REVENUES $ 23,171 $ 25,314 (8 )% GEOGRAPHY Americas $ 9,403 $ 9,726 (3 )%  % 44 % 42 % EMEA(1) 9,904 11,546 (14 ) (2 ) 46 49 Asia Pacific 2,270 2,115 7 12 10 9 TOTAL Net Revenues $ 21,577 $ 23,387 (8 )%  100 % 100 % TYPE OF WORK Consulting $ 12,556 $ 14,117 (11 )% (4 )% 58 % 60 % Outsourcing 9,021 9,270 (3 ) 6 42 40 TOTAL Net Revenues $ 21,577 $ 23,387 (8 )%  100 % 100 % n/m = not meaningful (1) EMEA includes Europe, Middle East and Asia.
We conduct business in the following countries that individually comprised more than 10% of consolidated net revenues within the three years ended August31, 2009: Year Ended August31, 2009 2008 2007 United States 36 % 34 % 36 % United Kingdom 10 12 14 Results of Operations for Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net Revenues Since January 2009, our business has been affected by the continuing global economic downturn. Many clients have delayed new large consulting commitments, have slowed the pace of on-going projects and have reduced requests for incremental projects. In addition, in response to clients seeking to reduce 48 Table of Contents operating costs with requests for price concessions, where practicable, we have shifted to lower-cost resources at a reduced price level. As a result, most of our operating groups experienced either declines in or lower local currency growth in consulting revenues beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Consulting revenues declined 12% in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, primarily due to declines in Communications& High Tech of 26%, Products of 22%, Financial Services of 12% and Resources of 5%, partially offset by local currency growth in Public Service of 19%. In addition, most of our operating groups experienced lower local currency growth in outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2009, compared with fiscal 2008. In the fourth quarter, outsourcing revenue growth in local currency slowed to 1%, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as growth in Products of 9%, Resources of 5% and Public Service of 2% was offset by declines in Financial Services of 8% and Communications& High Tech of 2%.
The following net revenues by operating group commentary discusses local currency net revenues changes in aggregate for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008:  Communications& High Tech net revenues decreased 4% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined 11% in local currency, with growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, more than offset by year-over-year contraction during the last three quarters. The aggregate local currency decline was due to declines across all industry groups in the Americas and EMEA regions. These declines were partially offset by consulting growth across all industry groups in the Asia Pacific region. Client strategy changes, particularly in Communications, have resulted in a number of contract modifications in fiscal 2009, which have had a negative impact on consulting revenues in fiscal 2009 and will continue to have a negative impact in fiscal 2010. Outsourcing revenues increased 4% in local currency, primarily driven by growth across all industry groups in the Asia Pacific region and in Electronics& High Tech and Media& Entertainment in the EMEA region, partially offset by a decline in Communications in the EMEA region.
Financial Services net revenues decreased 6% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined 11% in local currency, primarily due to declines in Banking in the EMEA region and, to a lesser extent, in Insurance and Capital Markets in the Americas region. These declines were partially offset by consulting growth in Banking in the Americas region and in Capital Markets in the EMEA region. Outsourcing revenues increased 2% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Banking in the EMEA region and in Insurance in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, partially offset by declines in Capital Markets in the Americas and EMEA regions. Client strategy changes and consolidations in the financial services industry have resulted in a number of outsourcing contract terminations, which have had a negative impact on our revenues, contributing to a decline in outsourcing revenues during the second half of fiscal 2009.
Products net revenues decreased 1% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined by 8% in local currency, with growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, more than offset by year-over-year contraction during the last three quarters. The aggregate local currency decline was primarily due to declines in the EMEA region across all industry groups except Retail and in the Americas region across all industry groups except Consumer Goods& Services. Outsourcing revenues increased 10% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Consumer Goods& Services, Health& Life Sciences and Transportation& Travel Services across all geographic regions.
Public Service net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Consulting revenues increased 16% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in the Americas region. Outsourcing revenues increased 3% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in the EMEA region, partially offset by a decline in the Americas region.
Resources net revenues increased 8% in local currency. Consulting revenues increased 7% in local currency, with strong growth in the first half of fiscal 2009, partially offset by year-over-year 49 Table of Contents contraction during the second half. The aggregate growth was led by Utilities in the EMEA region and Natural Resources in the Asia Pacific region, partially offset by a decline in Chemicals in the EMEA region. Outsourcing revenues increased 8% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Utilities and Energy in the EMEA region and growth in Utilities in the Americas region.
In the Americas region, net revenues were $9,403 million for fiscal 2009, compared with $9,726 million for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 3% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. We experienced growth in local currency in Brazil, driven by strong growth during the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, which moderated to flat growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This growth was offset by declines in the United States and Canada, where growth early in the year was more than offset by lower growth and/or declines that began in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
In the EMEA region, net revenues were $9,904 million for fiscal 2009, compared with $11,546 million for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 14% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency. In general, growth moderated or declined across the EMEA region beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, led by declines in local currency in the United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, Ireland and Sweden. In the Netherlands and Germany we experienced growth in local currency for the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, partially offset by a fourth quarter decline in Germany and flat growth in the Netherlands.
In the Asia Pacific region, net revenues were $2,270 million for fiscal 2009, compared with $2,115 million for fiscal 2008, an increase of 7% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. Growth in local currency was principally driven by our business in Australia and Singapore. InJapan we experienced growth in local currency for the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, partially offset by a fourth quarter decline.
Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2009 were $20,527 million, a decrease of $1,775 million, or 8%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 88.6% from 88.1% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2009 were $18,933 million, a decrease of $1,442 million, or 7%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 87.7% from 87.1% during this period.
Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2009 was $16,330 million, a decrease of $1,798 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 70.5% from 71.6% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2009 was $14,736 million, a decrease of $1,465 million, or 9%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.3% from 69.3% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2009 was 31.7%, an increase from 30.7% in fiscal 2008, driven primarily by improved overall outsourcing contract profitability.
Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2009 was $2,159 million, a decrease of $111 million, or 5%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.0% from 9.7% over this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to an increase in selling costs as a percentage of net revenues.
General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2009 were $1,789 million, a decrease of $92 million, or 5%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 8.3% from 8.0% over this period.
50 Table of Contents The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to a bad debt provision of $75 million, or 0.3% of net revenues. This provision reflects our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables, in light of global economic conditions, particularly from clients in high-risk industries or with potential liquidity issues.
Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net We recorded restructuring costs of $253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. These costs included $111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and $142 million related to realignment of our workforce, primarily at the senior-executive level, to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future.
We recorded net reorganization benefits of $3million for fiscal 2009, which included a $16 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by $13 million of interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities. We recorded net reorganization costs of $23million for fiscal 2008, related to interest expense associated with carrying the liabilities. In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August31, 2009, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $296million, of which $287million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12months. However, resolution of current tax audits, initiation of additional audits or litigation may delay final settlements. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2009 was $2,644 million, a decrease of $368 million, or 12%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as percentage of net revenues to 12.3% from 12.9% during this period. The restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2009 increased 50 basis points compared with fiscal 2008. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Year Ended August31, (Decrease) Increase(1) 2009 2008 Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin (in millions) Communications& High Tech $ 608 13 % $ 657 12 % $ (49 ) Financial Services 467 11 661 13 (193 ) Products 646 12 864 14 (218 ) Public Service 365 12 260 9 104 Resources 558 14 570 14 (12 ) Total $ 2,644 12.3 % $ 3,012 12.9 % $ (368 ) (1) May not total due to rounding.

While we have seen our net revenues contract, due to both the current global economic downturn and significant foreign-exchange rate fluctuations, we have improved our gross margins by focusing on contract profitability, particularly in our outsourcing business. This improvement was partially offset by higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues. In addition, each operating group recorded a portion of the $75 million bad debt provision and a portion of the $253 million restructuring cost. See General and Administrative Costs and Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net. During fiscal 2009, we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign-exchange rates on our operating income is similar to that disclosed for net revenues. The operating group commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2009, compared to fiscal 2008, exclusive of foreign-exchange rate, bad debt provision and restructuring impacts.
Communications& High Tech operating income increased due to improved outsourcing and consulting contract margins, offset by consulting revenue declines. In addition, fiscal 2008 reflected the impact of delivery inefficiencies on a small number of consulting contracts.
Financial Services operating income decreased, primarily due to consulting revenue declines, a lower proportion of high-margin consulting work and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by improved outsourcing contract margins.
Products operating income decreased due to declines in consulting revenue and consulting contract margins, early-stage work at lower margins on a few large contracts in the fourth quarter and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by improved outsourcing contract margins.
Public Service operating income increased due to resolution of a contract termination and improved delivery efficiencies compared with fiscal 2008 and consulting revenue growth.
Resources operating income increased due to revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract margins, partially offset by higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues.
52 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income was $50million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $65million, or 56%, from fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates for fiscal 2009 and 2008 were 27.6% and 29.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower expenses related to tax rate changes and other adjustments to prior-year tax liabilities required in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008.
Minority Interest Minority interest eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See BusinessOrganizational Structure. The resulting Net income of Accenture Ltd represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture Ltd. Since January 2002, minority interest has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to minority shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.
Minority interest was $348million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $157million, or 31%, from fiscal 2008. The change was due to a $259 million decrease in Income before minority interest and a reduction in the Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average minority ownership interests to 17% for fiscal 2009 from 22% for fiscal 2008.
Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.44 for fiscal 2009, compared with $2.65 for fiscal 2008. The $0.21 decrease in our earnings per share was primarily the result of $253 million in pre-tax restructuring costs, which reduced earnings per share by $0.24.Absent the restructuring costs, earnings per share increased $0.03 compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following:Increases of $0.11 from growth in revenues and operating income in local currency, $0.11 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, and $0.06 from a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.20 from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, compared with fiscal 2008, and $0.05 from other items, including reorganization benefits and non-operating items. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The consulting increase was driven by growth in the EMEA region across all industry groups. The outsourcing increase was led by growth in our Communications industry group across all geographic regions and in our Electronics& High Tech industry group in the Asia Pacific region.
Financial Services net revenues increased 6% in local currency, primarily due to outsourcing growth in our Banking industry group across all geographic regions and in our Insurance and Capital Markets industry groups in the Americas region. Consulting growth in our Banking and Insurance industry groups in the Americas region and in our Banking industry group in the Asia Pacific region was offset by a consulting revenue decline in the EMEA region, principally in our Banking and Capital Markets industry groups. During the first nine months of fiscal 2008, we 54 Table of Contents recorded modest growth in our Financial Services consulting business. However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we experienced a slight year over year decline in our consulting business.
Products net revenues increased 17% in local currency, driven by strong consulting and outsourcing growth across all geographic regions. The consulting growth was led by our Retail and Health& Life Sciences industry groups in the Americas region and by our Consumer Goods& Services, Retail and Industrial Equipment industry groups in the EMEA region. The outsourcing growth was led by our Health& Life Sciences and Consumer Goods& Services industry groups in the Americas region and by our Consumer Goods& Services, Automotive and Industrial Equipment industry groups in the EMEA region.
Public Service net revenues increased 7% in local currency, primarily due to consulting growth across all geographic regions, led by strong growth in the EMEA and Americas regions, partially offset by an outsourcing decline in the Americas region.
Resources net revenues increased 14% in local currency, primarily driven by strong consulting growth across all geographic regions, led by our Utilities and Natural Resources industry groups, and by solid outsourcing growth, led by our Utilities and Energy industry groups in the Americas region.
In the Americas region, we achieved net revenues of $9,726million for fiscal 2008, compared with $8,483million for fiscal 2007, an increase of 15% in U.S.dollars and 12% in local currency. Growth was principally driven by our business in the United States, Brazil and Canada.
In the EMEA region, we achieved net revenues of $11,546million for fiscal 2008, compared with $9,534million for fiscal 2007, an increase of 21% in U.S.dollars and 10% in local currency. Growth was led by our business in Italy, Spain and France.
In the Asia Pacific region, we achieved net revenues of $2,115million in fiscal 2008, compared with $1,679million for fiscal 2007, an increase of 26% in U.S.dollars and 15% in local currency. Growth was principally driven by our business in Japan, China and Singapore.
Operating Expenses Operating expenses were $22,302million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $3,342million, or 18%, over fiscal 2007, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 88.1% from 88.4% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses were $20,375million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $3,172million, or 18%, over fiscal 2007, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 87.1% from 87.3% during this period.
Cost of Services Cost of services was $18,128million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $2,717million, or 18%, over fiscal 2007, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 71.6% from 71.8% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses was $16,201million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $2,547million, or 19%, over fiscal 2007, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 69.3%. Gross margin (net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) remained flat at 30.7% during this period.
Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense was $2,271million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $367million, or 19%, over fiscal 2007, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 9.7% during this period.
55 Table of Contents General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs were $1,880million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $262million, or 16%, over fiscal 2007, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 8.0% from 8.2% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to strong revenue growth and our management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of our net revenues.
Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net We recorded net reorganization costs of $23million and $26million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to interest expense associated with carrying the reorganization liabilities. In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August31, 2008, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $309million, of which $299million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12months. However, resolution of current tax audits, initiation of additional audits or litigation may delay final settlements. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Operating Income Operating income was $3,012million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $519million, or 21%, from fiscal 2007. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 12.9% and 12.7% in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating income for each of the operating groups was as follows: Operating income for each of the operating groups was as follows: Year Ended August31, 2008 2007 Operating Income PercentofOG NetRevenues Operating Income PercentofOG NetRevenues Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Communications& High Tech $ 657 12 % $ 582 13 % $ 75 Financial Services 661 13 491 11 170 Products 864 14 669 14 195 Public Service 260 9 272 11 (12 ) Resources 570 14 479 15 91 Total $ 3,012 12.9 % $ 2,493 12.7 % $ 519 Operating income commentary for each of the operating groups is as follows:  Communications& High Tech operating income increased principally due to revenue growth, partially offset by delivery inefficiencies on a small number of consulting contracts.
Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to outsourcing revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract margins, partially offset by a decline in contract margins due to a lower proportion of high-margin consulting contracts. In addition, operating income for fiscal 2007 reflects the impact of delivery inefficiencies on several contracts.
Products operating income increased due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability.
Public Service operating income decreased slightly in fiscal 2008. Consulting revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract margins were more than offset by profitability challenges, 56 Table of Contents including delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts, revenue adjustments on certain contracts and higher selling costs associated with business-development opportunities which fueled strong fourth quarter fiscal 2008 bookings. The fiscal 2007 operating income also reflects asset impairments associated with an outsourcing contract recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
Resources operating income increased primarily due to strong revenue growth.
Gain on Investments, net Gain on investments, net was $6million in fiscal 2008, a decrease of $12million from fiscal 2007. The fiscal 2007 gain was primarily from a gain on the sale of a remaining investment from our portfolio of investments that was written down in fiscal 2002.
Interest Income Interest income was $115million in fiscal 2008, a decrease of $40million, or 26%, from fiscal 2007. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates.
Other Expense, net Other expense, net was $2million in fiscal 2008, a decrease of $20million from fiscal 2007. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in net foreign currency exchange losses.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates for fiscal 2008 and 2007 were 29.3% and 34.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2008 primarily as a result of benefits related to: final determinations of prior year tax liabilities, which reduced the rate by 3.9%; non-US research and development tax credits, which reduced the rate by 1.3%; and changes in the geographic distribution of income. These benefits were offset by expenses related to tax rate changes enacted during fiscal 2008, which reduced the value of our deferred tax assets. Fiscal 2007 included a reduction in the effective tax rate of 0.8%, recorded as a result of a nonrecurring benefit related to a reduction in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.
Minority Interest Minority interest eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See BusinessOrganizational Structure. The resulting Net income of Accenture Ltd represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture Ltd. Since January 2002, minority interest has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to minority shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.
Minority interest was $505million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $26million, or 5%, over fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Income before minority interest of $474million, partially offset by a reduction in the Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average minority ownership interests to 22% for fiscal 2008 from 27% for fiscal 2007.
Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.65 in fiscal 2008, compared with $1.97 in fiscal 2007. The $0.68 increase in our earnings per share was primarily the result of the following: $0.25 from strong 57 Table of Contents growth in revenues and operating income in local currency; $0.19 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.12 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, partially offset by $0.02 from lower non-operating income. In addition, favorable foreign currency exchange rates accounted for $0.14 of the increase. For information regarding our earnings per share calculation, see Note2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, debt capacity available under various credit facilities and available cash reserves. We may also be able to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:  take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion;  acquire complementary businesses or technologies;  develop new services and solutions;  respond to competitive pressures;or  facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of Accenture shares.
As of August31, 2009, cash and cash equivalents was $4,542million, compared with $3,603 million as of August31, 2008, an increase of $939million. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Year Ended August31, 2009 2008 2007(1) 2009to2008 Change(1) (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,160 $ 2,803 $ 2,631 $ 357 Investing activities (245 ) (324 ) (350 ) 79 Financing activities (1,850 ) (2,162 ) (2,128 ) 311 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (126 ) (29 ) 95 (96 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 939 $ 288 $ 247 $ 651 (1) May not total due to rounding.
Operating activities: The $357million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services and deferred revenues), partially offset by changes in other operating assets and liabilities. Cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2008 also reflected a payment of $143 million to settle tax audits related to reorganization liabilities.
Investing activities: The $79million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in spending on business acquisitions and lower spending on property and equipment partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments.
Financing activities: The $311million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of common shares, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note14 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
58 Table of Contents We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.
Borrowing Facilities As of August31, 2009, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: FacilityAmount Borrowings Under Facilities (in millions) Syndicated loan facility(1) $ 1,200 $  Separate bilateral, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities(2) 350  Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit(3) 188  Total $ 1,738 $  (1) This facility, which matures on July31, 2012, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. This facility requires us to: (1)limit liens placed on our assets to (a)liens incurred in the ordinary course of business (subject to certain qualifications) and (b)other liens securing obligations not to exceed 30% of our consolidated assets; and (2) maintain a debt-to-cash-flow ratio not exceeding 1.75 to 1.00. We continue to be in compliance with these terms. As of August31, 2009 and 2008, we had no borrowings under the facility. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees.
(2) We maintain two separate bilateral, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local-currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the bilateral revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of August31, 2009 and 2008, we had no borrowings and $5million, respectively, of borrowings under these facilities. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under these multicurrency credit facilities and lines of credit, based on the average annual balances, was approximately 4% in fiscal 2009 and 8% in fiscal 2008.
(3) We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of August31, 2009 and 2008, we had no borrowings under these various facilities.
Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $172million and $169million of letters of credit outstanding as of August31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, we had total outstanding debt of $1 million and $3 million as of August31, 2009 and 2008.
Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture Ltd has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares, Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees.

These shares are held as treasury shares by one or more subsidiaries of Accenture Ltd and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees.
(2) During fiscal 2009, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares under those plans.
As of August31, 2009, our aggregate available authorization was $852 million for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program and the other share purchase programs.
Other Share Redemptions During fiscal 2009, we issued 1,125,645 Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the registration statement) filed on May15, 2007. The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by our senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees.
Subsequent Developments On June10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction). On August5, 2009, the shareholders of Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, voted in favor of the Transaction. The Transaction was subsequently completed on September1, 2009, following approval from the Supreme Court of Bermuda, at which time Accenture Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company. In the Transaction, all of the outstanding ClassA and Class X common shares of Accenture Ltd were cancelled and Accenture plc issued ClassA and Class X ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the cancelled Accenture Ltd ClassA and Class X common shares, as applicable. The transaction has no impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
On September 1, 2009, we filed an amendment to our registration statement to enable us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by our senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees.
On September30, 2009, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a cash dividend of $0.75 per share on our ClassA ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October16, 2009. Accenture plc will cause Accenture SCA to declare a cash dividend of $0.75 per share on its ClassI common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October13, 2009. Both dividends are payable on November16, 2009.
60 Table of Contents On September30, 2009, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved $4.0 billion in additional share repurchase authority, bringing Accentures total outstanding authority to approximately $4.9 billion.
Obligations and Commitments As of August31, 2009, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Contractual Cash Obligations(1)(2) Total Lessthan 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Morethan 5 years (in millions) Long-term debt $ 1 $ 1 $  $  $  Operating leases 1,968 400 521 322 725 Retirement obligations(3) 135 29 28 23 55 Other commitments(4) 115 40 43 29 3 Total $ 2,219 $ 470 $ 592 $ 374 $ 783 (1) We adopted FIN48 on September1, 2007. The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, refer to Note10 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
(2) In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August31, 2009, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $296 million, of which $287 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12months. The reorganization liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and/or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
(3) This represents projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Because these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May15, 2001.
(4) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.
Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the clients claim. Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.
For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
61 Table of Contents To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 16 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No.133 (SFAS 161). This Statement requires enhanced disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities about (i)how and why a company uses derivative instruments, (ii)how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its related interpretations, and (iii)how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a companys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. On December1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 161 and it did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
On September1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In accordance with FASB Staff Position 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No.157, we elected to defer the adoption of the provisions of SFAS 157 for our non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities. Such assets and liabilities, which include our Deferred contract costs, Property and equipment, net and Goodwill, will be subject to the provisions of SFAS 157 on September1, 2009. We are currently assessing the potential impact the adoption of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see Note 8 (Fair Value Measurements) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Effective September1, 2008, we adopted the year-end measurement date provision of SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 106, and 132(R), using an approach generally known as the one measurement approach. The adoption of the provision had the following impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheet: decreased Retained earnings by $5.3 million, decreased Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income by $0.3 million, decreased Other non-current assets by $2.7 million and increased Retirement obligation by $2.9 million.
On March1, 2009, we adoptedSFAS165, Subsequent Events (SFAS 165), which establishes general standards of accounting and disclosure for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued.SFAS 165 sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date.The adoption of SFAS 165 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which is a revision of SFAS 141, Business Combinations.
SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for: recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed 62 Table of Contents and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; expensing acquisition related costs as incurred; and determining what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 141R for acquisitions that occur on or after September1, 2009. The impact of SFAS 141R on our Consolidated Financial Statements will depend on the size and nature of any acquisitions on or after September1, 2009.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No.51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (previously referred to as minority interests). Upon adoption of SFAS 160 on September1, 2009, we will be required to report any noncontrolling interests as a separate component of Consolidated Shareholders Equity.
ITEM7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.
Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.
Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedgesprimarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Brazilian real, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen and U.S. dollar/Norwegian kroneare intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedgesU.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.K. pound/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years  are intended to partially offset the impact of currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by Accentures Global Delivery Network.
For designated cash flow hedges, gains (losses) currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of Services. As of August31, 2009, it is anticipated that $8million of the net loss, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income will be reclassified into Cost of Services within the next 12months.
We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S.dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $180million and $146million as of August31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
63 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August31, 2009 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.
Equity Price Risk The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM9.CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None.
ITEM9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.
(b)Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and/or our Board of Directors;and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of any unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
64 Table of Contents Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K.
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued its attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. See Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on pageF-2.
(c)Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We also have audited Accenture Ltds internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Accenture Ltds management is responsible for these Consolidated Financial Statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item9A(b)). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Accenture Ltd and its subsidiaries as of August31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August31, 2009, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Accenture Ltd maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial F-2 Table of Contents reporting as of August31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Drawing on a combination of industry expertise, functional capabilities, alliances, global resources and technology, Accenture Ltd delivers competitively priced, high-value services that help clients measurably improve business performance. Accenture Ltds global delivery model enables it to provide a complete end-to-end delivery capability by drawing on its global resources to deliver high-quality, cost-effective solutions to clients under demanding timeframes.
Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture Ltd, a Bermuda company, and its controlled subsidiary companies (collectively, the Company). Accenture Ltds only business is to hold ClassII and ClassIII common shares in, and to act as the sole general partner of, its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares. The Company operates its business through Accenture SCA and subsidiaries of Accenture SCA. Accenture Ltd controls Accenture SCAs management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCAs results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
The shares of Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than the Company are treated as a minority interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The minority interest percentages were 15% and 19% as of August31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Purchases and/or redemptions of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares are accounted for at carryover basis.
All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to the Companys fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to fiscal 2009 means the 12-month period that ended on August31, 2009. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of the Companys fiscal year.
Reincorporation in Ireland On June10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of the Companys parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction). On August5, 2009, the shareholders of Accenture Ltd, the Companys predecessor holding company, voted in favor of the Transaction. The Transaction was subsequently completed on September1, 2009, following approval from the Supreme Court of Bermuda, at which time Accenture Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became the Companys parent holding company. In the Transaction, all of the outstanding ClassA and Class X common shares of Accenture Ltd were cancelled and Accenture plc issued ClassA and Class X ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the cancelled Accenture Ltd ClassA and Class X common shares, as applicable. As a result of the Transaction, Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, which were redeemable for, at the Companys election, cash or Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares based on the market price of the Accenture Ltd F-9 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ClassA common shares at the time of the redemption, are now redeemable for, at the Companys election, cash or Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares based on the market price of the Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share at the time of redemption.
On September1, 2009, also in connection with the Transaction, Accenture plc and Accenture Ltd entered into an Assumption and General Amendment Agreement pursuant to which Accenture Ltd assigned to Accenture plc, and Accenture plc assumed, the Accenture Ltd 2001 Share Incentive Plan (the SIP) and the Accenture Ltd 2001 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the ESPP), including all award or grant documents or agreements thereunder. All awards or grants under the equity incentive plans continue to be exercisable, issuable, held, available or vest upon the same terms and conditions as under the awards or grants prior to their assumption by Accenture plc, except that upon the exercise, issuance, holding, availability or vesting of those awards or grants, Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares are now issuable or available, or benefits or other amounts determined, in lieu of Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares.
Use of Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.
Reclassifications Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2009 presentation.
Revenue Recognition Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where the Company designs/redesigns, builds and implements new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for its clients are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Estimated revenues for applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If the Companys estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities. Contract loss provisions recorded as of August, 31, 2009 and 2008 are immaterial.
F-10 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB101), as amended by SABNo.104, Revenue Recognition (SAB104). The Company considers amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, the Companys efforts, measured by time incurred, typically represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, the Company recognizes revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, the Company hires client employees and becomes responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SAB101, as amended by SAB104. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, the Companys effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $521,776 and $522,806 as of August31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Deferred transition revenues were $535,939 and $549,865 as of August31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are included in non-current Deferred revenues relating to contract costs.
Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the elements relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become F-11 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) non-contingent. Fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately. Revenues are recognized in accordance with the Companys accounting policies for the separate elements, as described above. Elements qualify for separation when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Companys control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as the Company also sells those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
Revenues before reimbursements (net revenues) include the margin earned on computer hardware and software, as well as revenues from alliance agreements. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. The Company reports revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
Income Taxes The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company establishes liabilities or reduces assets for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes certain tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged. Each fiscal quarter, the Company evaluates these uncertain tax positions and adjusts the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances.
Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts Assets and liabilities of non-U.S.subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S.dollar are translated into U.S.dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expense items are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including money market funds of $732,167 and $73,559 as of August31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As a result of certain subsidiaries cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash payables. Such negative balances are classified as Short-term bank borrowings.
F-12 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Client Receivables and Allowances The Company records its client receivables and unbilled services at their face amounts less allowances. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its receivables and unbilled services and establishes allowances based on historical experience and other currently available information. As of August31, 2009 and 2008, total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $101,517 and $42,912, respectively. The allowance reflects the Companys best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables and unbilled services, in light of the global economic downturn, particularly from clients in high-risk industries or with potential liquidity issues. In limited circumstances, the Company agrees to extend financing to certain clients. The terms vary by contract, but generally payment for services is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestones. Imputed interest is recorded at market rates in Interest income.
Concentrations of Credit Risk The Companys financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign exchange instruments, client receivables and unbilled services, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducts ongoing evaluation of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business. Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.
Investments All liquid investments with an original maturity greater than 90days but less than one year are considered to be short-term investments. Investments with an original maturity greater than one year are considered to be long-term investments. Marketable short-term and long-term investments are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale investments. Available-for-sale investments are reported at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. Quoted market prices are used to determine the fair values of common equity and debt securities that were issued by publicly traded entities. Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in Interest income. Realized gains and losses on securities are determined based on the First In, First Out method and are included in Gain on investments, net. The Company does not hold these investments for speculative or trading purposes.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: Buildings 20to25years Computers, related equipment and software 2 to 7 years Furniture and fixtures 5 to 10 years Leasehold improvements Lesserofleasetermor15years Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of F-13 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) long-lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future net cash flows. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.
Operating Expenses Selected components of operating expenses were as follows: Year Ended August31, 2009 2008 2007 Training costs $ 794,218 $ 985,929 $ 775,768 Research and development costs 434,937 390,168 307,357 Advertising costs 77,315 91,034 94,404 Provision for doubtful accounts(1) 75,008 1,772 9,441 (1) For additional information, see  Client Receivables and Allowances.
Subcontractor costs are included in Cost of services as they are incurred.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements On September1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In accordance with FASB Staff Position 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No.157, the Company elected to defer the adoption of the provisions of SFAS 157 for its non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities. Such assets and liabilities, which include the Companys Deferred contract costs, Property and equipment, net and Goodwill, will be subject to the provisions of SFAS 157 on September1, 2009. The Companys adoption of SFAS 157 for its non-financial assets did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see Note 8 (Fair Value Measurements) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Effective September1, 2008, the Company adopted the year-end measurement date provision of SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 106, and 132(R), using an approach generally known as the one measurement approach. The adoption of the provision had the following impact on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet: decreased Retained earnings by $5,302; decreased Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income by $286; decreased Other non-current assets by $2,736; and increased Retirement obligation by $2,852.
On December1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No.133 (SFAS 161). This Statement requires enhanced disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities about (i)how and why a company uses derivative instruments; (ii)how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133) and its related interpretations; and (iii)how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a companys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The Companys adoption of SFAS 161 did not have a material impact on its F-14 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
On March1, 2009, the Company adoptedSFAS165, Subsequent Events (SFAS 165), which establishes general standards of accounting and disclosure for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued.SFAS 165 sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date.The Companys adoption of SFAS 165 did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

The income effect does not take into account Minority interestother, since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares.
F-15 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, 193,143 options, 53,948 options and 8,318 options, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise prices would render them anti-dilutive.
3.RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION COSTS, NET Restructuring Costs The Company recognized restructuring costs of $252,566in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs included $110,338 principally related to global consolidation of office space and $142,228 related to realignment of the Companys workforce, primarily at the senior executive level. The restructuring costs were allocated to the reportable operating segments as follows: $49,192to Communications& High Tech; $53,155 to Financial Services; $66,073 to Products; $37,836 to Public Service; and $46,310 to Resources.
The Companys restructuring activity was as follows: 2009Workforce Realignment 2009 Space Abandonment Other Space Abandonment(1) YearEnded August31, 2009 Restructuring liability balance, beginning of period $  $  $ 32,132 $ 32,132 Restructuring costs 142,228 110,338  252,566 Asset impairments  (20,074 )  (20,074 ) Payments made (732 ) (1,213 ) (4,531 ) (6,476 ) Other adjustments(2) 572 (240 ) 7,163 7,495 Restructuring liability, end of period $ 142,068 $ 88,811 $ 34,764 $ 265,643 (1) Related to space abandonment recorded in fiscal 2002 and 2004.
(2) Represents foreign currency translation and revised sublease assumptions for space abandoned in 2004.
The restructuring liabilities at August31, 2009 were $265,643, of which $175,923 was included in Other accrued liabilities and $89,720 was included in Other non-current liabilities. The Company expects to pay liabilities related to workforce realignment during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. The remaining liabilities represent the net present value of estimated obligations for operating leases on abandoned office space.
Reorganization Costs (Benefits) In fiscal 2001, the Company accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with its transition to a corporate structure. These liabilities included certain non-income tax liabilities, such as stamp taxes, as well as liabilities for certain individual income tax exposures related to the transfer of interests in certain entities to the Company as part of the reorganization. These primarily represent unusual and disproportionate individual income tax exposures assumed by certain, but not all, of the Companys shareholders and partners in certain tax jurisdictions specifically related to the transfer of their partnership interests in certain entities to the Company as part of the reorganization. (Prior to fiscal 2005, the Company referred to its highest-level employees with the partner title and the Company continues to use the term partner to refer to these persons in certain situations related to its reorganization and F-16 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) the period prior to its incorporation.) The Company identified certain shareholders and partners who may incur such unusual and disproportionate financial damage in certain jurisdictions. These include shareholders and partners who were subject to tax in their jurisdiction on items of income arising from the reorganization transaction that were not taxable for most other shareholders and partners. In addition, certain other shareholders and partners were subject to a different rate or amount of tax than other shareholders or partners in the same jurisdiction. When additional taxes are assessed on these shareholders or partners in connection with these transfers, the Company has made and intends to make payments to reimburse certain costs associated with the assessment either to the shareholder or partner, or to the taxing authority. The Company has recorded reorganization expense and the related liability where such liabilities are probable. Interest accruals are made to cover reimbursement of interest on such tax assessments.
The Companys reorganization activity was as follows: Year Ended August31, 2009 2008 2007 Reorganization liability balance, beginning of period $ 308,694 $ 401,228 $ 350,864 Final determinations(1) (23,479 ) (86,764 ) (44,066 ) Changes in estimates 7,297 86,764 44,066 Benefits recorded (16,182 )   Interest expense accrued 12,889 22,872 26,366 Payments  (143,184 )  Foreign currency translation (9,297 ) 27,778 23,998 Reorganization liability, end of period $ 296,104 $ 308,694 $ 401,228 (1) Includes final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations.
As of August31, 2009, reorganization liabilities of $286,922 were included in Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months, and reorganization liabilities of $9,182 were included in Other non-current liabilities. Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and/or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution. Final resolution, through settlement, conclusion of legal proceedings or a tax authoritys decision not to pursue a claim, will result in payment by the Company of amounts in settlement or judgment of these matters and/or recording of a reorganization benefit or cost in the Companys Consolidated Income Statement. It is possible the aggregate amount of such payments in connection with resolution of all such proceedings could exceed the currently recorded amounts. As of August31, 2009, only a small number of jurisdictions remain that have active audits/investigations or open statutes of limitations, and only one is significant. In that jurisdiction, current and former partners are engaged in a dispute with tax authorities in connection with the corporate reorganization in 2001. These individuals and the Company intend to vigorously defend their positions.

In addition, during fiscal 2007, the Company completed two individually immaterial acquisitions of businesses providing various technology consulting, advisory and outsourcing services. The total consideration for all fiscal 2007 acquisitions was $187,030. In connection with these acquisitions, the Company recorded combined goodwill of $127,129, a portion of which was allocated to each of the reportable segments. The Company also recorded $36,546 in intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships and intellectual property. The intangible assets are being amortized over a period of one to six years. The pro forma effects on the Companys operations were not material.
During fiscal 2007, the Company also recorded net reductions in goodwill of $25,910, primarily resulting from reversals of valuation allowances related to pre-acquisition tax attributes recorded under purchase accounting for previous acquisitions and other adjustments related to purchase accounting for previous acquisitions.
During fiscal 2008, the Company completed twelve individually immaterial acquisitions of businesses providing various technology consulting, advisory and outsourcing services, for total consideration of $304,431. In addition, the Company may be required to make payments totaling up to approximately $70,000 in additional purchase price over a four-year period that began on September1, 2008, conditional on achieving certain performance measures or periods of service. In connection with these acquisitions, the Company recorded combined goodwill of $212,075, a portion of which was allocated to each of the reportable segments. The Company also recorded $72,005 in intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships and intellectual property. The intangible assets are being amortized over a period of less than one year to fifteen years. The pro forma effects on the Companys operations were not material.
The Company performed impairment tests of goodwill for the three years ended August31, 2009 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment are as follows.

Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.
Certain derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. Credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to the Company, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based on the gross fair value of all of the Companys derivative financial instruments, was approximately $13,604 as of August31, 2009. The Company has limited its credit risk by entering into derivative transactions only with highly-rated global financial institutions, limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducting ongoing evaluation of the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business.
The Company also utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. These provisions may reduce the Companys potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and reduce a counterpartys potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of the Company. Additionally, these agreements contain early termination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterpartys credit rating, thereby enabling the Company to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease the Companys realized loss on an open transaction. Similarly, a decrement in the Companys credit rating could trigger a counterpartys early termination rights, thereby enabling a counterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase the Companys realized loss on an open transaction. The aggregate fair value of the Companys derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position as of August31, 2009 was $31,025.
The Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statement. The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows: August31, 2009 2008 Notional Value Fair Value Notional Value Fair Value Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: To buy $ 1,913,263 $ (17,018 ) $ 1,632,742 $ 15,604 To sell 106,962 (403 ) 211,230 (163 ) Cash Flow Hedges Certain of the Companys subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of resources supplied by the Companys Global Delivery Network. To mitigate this risk, the Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future. The Company has F-20 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges. As of August31, 2009, the Company held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment hedges.
In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedge item, the risk being hedged, the Companys risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. The Company assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges using the Hypothetical Derivative Method, which measures hedge ineffectiveness based on a comparison of the change in fair value of the actual derivative designated as the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative.The hypothetical derivative would have terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item.The Company measures and records hedge ineffectiveness at the end of each fiscal quarter.
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as a separate component of Shareholders Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. Amounts reclassified into Cost of services for fiscal 2009 were $13,351 net of taxes. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement and for fiscal 2009 was not material. As of August31, 2009, amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income totaled $(10,575), net of taxes, of which $(7,706) is expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. In addition, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges during fiscal 2009.
The fair values of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: August31, 2009 Assets Other current assets $ 5,596 Other non-current assets 2,251 Total $ 7,847 Liabilities Other accrued liabilities $ 19,227 Other non-current liabilities 7,157 Total $ 26,384 F-21 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Other Derivatives The Company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which have not been designated as hedges, to hedge balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany loans. These instruments are generally short-term in nature, with typical maturities of less than one year, and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement and was a net gain of $32,244 for fiscal 2009.
The fair values of other derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: August31, 2009 Other current assets $ 5,757 Other accrued liabilities 4,641 For additional information related to derivative financial instruments, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income) and Note 8 (Fair Value Measurements) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
8.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including the Companys own credit risk.
The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Companys market assumptions. The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:  Level 1Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;  Level 2Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets; and  Level 3Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
Short-term Investments and Investments The Companys Short-term investments and Investments consist primarily of corporate notes. Fair values for corporate notes are based on prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services and are classified as Level 2. The third-party pricing services fair values are model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. Inputs include recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.
F-22 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Derivative Financial Instruments The Companys derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2. All of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets. Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing.

For all other deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a net increase of $3,776 related to individually insignificant changes in the valuation allowance. As of August 31, 2009 and 2008, $4,382 and $4,316, respectively, of the valuation allowances related to pre-acquisition tax attributes recorded under purchase accounting, the reversal of which in future years will be allocated first to reduce goodwill and then to reduce other non-current intangible assets of the acquired entity.
The Company had net operating loss carryforwards as of August 31, 2009 of $610,677. Of this amount, $151,230 expires at various dates through 2029, and $459,447 has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company had tax credit carryforwards as of August 31, 2009 of $44,971, of which $36,848 will expire at various dates through 2022 and $8,123 has an indefinite carryforward period.
As of August 31, 2009, the Company had $1,053,426 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $589,497, if recognized, would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate. As of August 31, 2008, the Company had $1,087,001 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $687,814, if recognized, would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate. The differences of $463,929 and $399,187, F-25 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) respectively, represents items recorded as adjustments to equity and offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 2009 2008 Balance at beginning of period $ 1,087,001 $ 1,031,800 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 131,168 174,585 Additions for tax positions related to prior years 13,451 46,720 Reductions for tax positions related to prior years (132,784 ) (131,102 ) Statute of limitations expirations (7,002 ) (8,967 ) Settlements with tax authorities (38,408 ) (26,035 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,053,426 $ 1,087,001 The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized approximately $47,498 and $59,419 in interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $190,024 ($131,884, net of tax benefits) and $153,381 ($103,502, net of tax benefits) on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of August 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the tax years 2003 to 2007. The Company does not expect these years to be effectively settled within the next 12 months. The Company is also currently under audit in numerous state and non-US tax jurisdictions. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, the Company does not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for the years before 2003. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $56,819 of its unrecognized tax benefits, each of which is individually insignificant, may be resolved in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations and other adjustments. The majority of this amount relates to transfer pricing matters and tax credits in non-US jurisdictions.
As of August 31, 2009, the Company had not recognized a deferred tax liability on $1,489,273 of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested. If such earnings were distributed, some countries may impose withholding taxes. It is not practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability.
On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) became law. The AJCA includes a deduction of 85 percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. The Companys Avanade Inc. subsidiary (Avanade) elected to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in its tax year ending September 30, 2006. Avanade elected under this provision to repatriate $20,643 in September 2006. The tax expense on the repatriated earnings was $4.
Portions of the Companys operations are subject to reduced tax rates or are free of tax under various tax holidays which expire during fiscal 2011, 2012 and 2013. Some of the holidays are renewable at F-26 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) reduced levels, with renewal periods through 2023. The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be approximately $78,000, $71,000 and $23,000 in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
11.RETIREMENT AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS Defined Benefit Pension In the United States and certain other countries, the Company maintains and administers defined benefit retirement plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees. Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan. The Company utilizes actuarial methods required by SFAS87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, to account for pension benefit plans. Effective September1, 2008, the Company adopted the year-end measurement date provision of SFAS158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 106, and 132(R), using an approach generally known as the one measurement approach. The adoption of the provision had the following impact on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet: decreased Retained earnings by $5,302; decreased Accumulated other comprehensive (loss)income by $286; decreased Other non-current assets by $2,736; and increased Retirement obligation by $2,852.
In addition, certain postemployment benefits, including severance benefits, disability-related benefits and continuation of benefits, such as healthcare benefits and life insurance coverage, are provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. These costs are substantially provided for on an accrual basis.
Assumptions Beginning September1, 2008, the Company uses an August31 measurement date for its U.S.and non-U.S.benefit plans. Prior to September1, 2008, the Company used either a June30 or August31 measurement date.
The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the fiscal year-end pension benefit obligations are as follows: August31, 2009 2008 U.S.Plans Non-U.S.
Plans U.S.Plans Non-U.S.
Plans Discount rate 6.00 % 5.26 % 6.75 % 5.45 % Rate of increase in future compensation 4.00 % 3.32 % 4.59 % 3.59 % The Companys methodology for selecting the discount rate for the U.S.Plans is to match the plans cash flows to that of the average of two yield curves that provide the equivalent yields on zero-coupon corporate bonds for each maturity. The discount rate assumption for the Non-U.S.Plans primarily reflects the market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments. The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the Companys pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year. The expected long-term rate of return on F-27 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns on pension and other postretirement plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio.
Pension Expense Pension expense for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $64,400, $59,355 and $90,316 respectively.

The plans future prospects, their current financial conditions, the Companys current funding levels and other relevant factors suggest that the plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of returns in order to achieve long-term objectives without undue risk to the plans ability to meet their current benefit obligations. The Company recognizes that asset allocation of the pension plans assets is an important factor in determining long-term performance. Actual asset allocations at any point in time may vary from the specified targets below and will be dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, required cash flows, and investment decisions of the investment committee and the pension plans investment funds and managers. Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing.
Non-U.S. Pension Plans Plan assets in non-U.S.pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation. The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers. In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with the Company. Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset mix of that plan. In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities. Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, who determines the investment strategy. Pension plans in certain countries are unfunded.

13.SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Accenture Ltd Preferred Shares The Company has 2,000,000,000 authorized preferred shares, par value $0.0000225 per share, the rights and preferences of which are currently undesignated. The Board of Directors of Accenture Ltd has the authority to issue the preferred shares in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions attaching to those shares, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption terms and prices, liquidation preferences and the numbers of shares constituting any series and the designation of any series, without further vote or action by the shareholders.
Any series of preferred shares could, as determined by Accenture Ltds Board of Directors at the time of issuance, rank senior to the Companys common shares with respect to dividends, voting rights, redemption and/or liquidation rights. These preferred shares are of the type commonly known as blank-check preferred stock.
ClassA Common Shares Holders of Accenture Ltds ClassA common shares are entitled to one vote per share and do not have cumulative voting rights. Each ClassA common share entitles its holder to a pro rata part of any dividend at the times and in the amounts, if any, which Accenture Ltds Board of Directors from time to time determines to declare, subject to any preferred dividend rights attaching to any preferred shares. Each ClassA common share is entitled on a winding-up of Accenture Ltd to be paid a pro rata part of the value of the assets of Accenture Ltd remaining after payment of its liabilities, subject to any preferred rights on liquidation attaching to any preferred shares.
ClassX Common Shares Holders of Accenture Ltds ClassX common shares are entitled to one vote per share and do not have cumulative voting rights. Holders of ClassX common shares are not entitled to receive dividends and are not entitled to be paid any amount upon a winding-up of Accenture Ltd. Most of the Companys partners who received Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with the Companys transition to a corporate structure received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd ClassX common shares. Accenture Ltd may redeem, at its option, any ClassX common share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the ClassX common share. Accenture Ltd has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any ClassX common share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of ClassX common shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or Accenture F-35 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder, as the case may be. Accenture Ltd will redeem ClassX common shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of ClassX common shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. ClassX common shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture Ltd.
Equity of Subsidiaries Redeemable or Exchangeable for Accenture Ltd ClassA Common Shares Accenture SCA ClassI Common Shares Senior executives in certain countries, including the United States, received Accenture SCA ClassI common shares in connection with the Companys transition to a corporate structure. Only the Companys current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees hold Accenture SCA ClassI common shares. Each Accenture SCA ClassI common share entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture SCA and entitles its holders to dividends and liquidation payments.
Subject to the transfer restrictions in Accenture SCAs Articles of Association, Accenture SCA is obligated, at the option of the holder, to redeem any outstanding Accenture SCA ClassI common share at a redemption price per share generally equal to its current market value as determined in accordance with Accenture SCAs Articles of Association. Under Accenture SCAs Articles of Association, the market value of a ClassI common share that is not subject to transfer restrictions will be deemed to be equal to (i)the average of the high and low sales prices of an Accenture Ltd ClassA common share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other designated market on which the ClassA common shares trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs, or (ii)if Accenture Ltd sells its ClassA common shares on the date that the redemption price is determined (other than in a transaction with any employee or an affiliate or pursuant to a preexisting obligation), the weighted average sales price of an Accenture Ltd ClassA common share on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other market on which the ClassA common shares primarily trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs. Accenture SCA may, at its option, pay this redemption price with cash or by delivering Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares on a one-for-one basis. Each holder of ClassI common shares is entitled to a pro rata part of any dividend and, subject to the rights of the holders of ClassII common shares and ClassIII common shares, to the value of any remaining assets of Accenture SCA after payment of its liabilities upon dissolution.
Accenture SCA ClassII and ClassIII common shares On June28, 2005, Accenture SCAs shareholders approved certain amendments to the rights of Accenture SCA ClassII common shares held by Accenture Ltd, as well as the creation of a new class of common shares known as ClassIII common shares into which all ClassI common shares held by Accenture Ltd and its affiliates were reclassified. All ClassI common shares sold or otherwise transferred to Accenture Ltd or its subsidiaries are automatically reclassified into ClassIII common shares.
Accenture SCA ClassII common shares and ClassIII common shares (or any lettered sub-series of that class) are not entitled to any cash dividends. If the Board of Directors of Accenture Ltd authorizes the payment of a cash dividend on Accenture Ltds ClassA common shares, the general partner of Accenture SCA will cause Accenture SCA to redeem ClassII common shares and ClassIII common F-36 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) shares that Accenture Ltd holds to obtain cash needed to pay dividends on its ClassA common shares. At any time that Accenture SCA were to pay a cash dividend on its ClassI common shares, new ClassII common shares and ClassIII common shares would be issued to the existing holders of ClassII common shares and ClassIII common shares, in each case having an aggregate value of the amount of any cash dividends that the holders of those ClassII or ClassIII common shares would have received had they ratably participated in the cash dividend paid on the ClassI common shares.
Each ClassII common share entitles its holder to receive a liquidation payment equal to 10% of any liquidation payment to which a ClassI common share entitles its holder. Each ClassIII common share entitles its holder to receive a liquidation payment equal to 100% of any liquidation payment to which a ClassI common share entitles its holder.
Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Partners resident in Canada and New Zealand received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with the Companys transition to a corporate structure. Subject to the transfer restrictions contained in Accenture Ltds bye-laws, holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares on a one-for-one basis. The Company may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture Ltd ClassA common share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture Ltd ClassA common share entitles its holder.
Subsequent Event The Transaction resulted in changes in the Companys Shareholders Equity effective September1, 2009. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesReincorporation in Ireland).
14.MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Share Purchase And RedemptionActivity The Board of Directors of Accenture Ltd has authorized funding for the Companys publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares, Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by the Companys current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees.
F-37 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) The Companys share purchase activity during fiscal 2009 was as follows: Accenture Ltd Class A Common Shares Accenture SCA Class I Common Shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.

The registration statement allows the Company, at its option, to issue freely tradable Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by the Companys senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees.
Subsequent Events On September 1, 2009, Accenture plc filed an amendment to its registration statement to enable the Company, at its option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by the Companys senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees.

15.LEASE COMMITMENTS The Company has operating leases, principally for office space, with various renewal options. Substantially all operating leases are non-cancelable or cancelable only by the payment of penalties. Rental expense in agreements with rent holidays and scheduled rent increases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rental expense including operating costs and taxes and sublease income from third parties during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Rental expense $ 500,949 $ 521,880 $ 455,212 Sublease income from third parties (33,179 ) (37,625 ) (35,147 ) Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases as of August31, 2009, were as follows: Operating Lease Payments Operating Sublease Income 2010 $ 400,095 $ (33,062 ) 2011 303,316 (27,051 ) 2012 218,112 (23,164 ) 2013 172,862 (21,982 ) 2014 149,389 (21,562 ) Thereafter 724,596 (64,975 ) $ 1,968,370 $ (191,796 ) 16.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments The Company has the right to purchase substantially all of the remaining outstanding shares of its Avanade Inc. subsidiary (Avanade) not owned by the Company at fair value if certain events occur. The Company may also be required to purchase substantially all of the remaining outstanding shares of Avanade at fair value if certain events occur.
Holders of Avanade common stock and options to purchase the stock have put rights that, under certain circumstances and conditions, require Avanade to redeem shares of its stock at fair value. Had the Company reflected the fair value of Avanades redeemable common stock and the intrinsic value of the options on redeemable common stock (the Values) as of August31, 2009 and August31, 2008, the Companys Minority interest would have been increased by $51,372 and $116,572, respectively. On September1, 2009, the Company will be required to report any noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) as a separate component of Consolidated Shareholders Equity and record the Values within noncontrolling interests.
F-39 Table of Contents ACCENTURE LTD NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements through which it may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby the Company has joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which the Company agrees to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.
Typically, the Company has contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the clients claim. Payments by the Company under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by the Company typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.
As of August31, 2009 and August31, 2008, the Companys aggregate potential liability to its clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $508,000 and $430,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $24,000 and $17,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if the Company is obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties that are the consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
To date, the Company has not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. The Company has assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believes that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole.
Legal Contingencies As of August31, 2009, the Company or its present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. The Company and/or its personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of its business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes these matters will not ultimately have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial condition.
