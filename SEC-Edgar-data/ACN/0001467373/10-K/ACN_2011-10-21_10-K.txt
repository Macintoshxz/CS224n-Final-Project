Alliances We have sales and delivery alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own, either by, among other things, enhancing a service offering, delivering a new technology or helping us extend our services to new geographies. By combining our alliance partners products and services with our own capabilities and expertise, we create innovative, high-value business solutions for our clients. Some 12 Table of Contents alliances are specifically aligned with one of our service lines, thereby adding skills, technology and insights that are applicable across many of the industries we serve. Other alliances extend and enhance our offerings specific to a single industry group. Almost all of our alliances are non-exclusive. These alliances can generate significant revenues from services to implement our alliance partners products. We also receive some direct payments, which are not material to our business, from our alliance partners as compensation for marketing, technical and other assistance.
Research and Innovation We are committed to developing leading-edge ideas, as we believe that both research and innovation have been major factors in our success and will help us continue to grow in the future.We use our investment in research and developmenton which we spent $384million, $435million and $390 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectivelyto help create, commercialize and disseminate innovative business strategies and technology solutions.
Our research and innovation program is designed to generate early insights into how knowledge can be harnessed to create innovative business solutions for our clients and to develop business strategies with significant value.One component of this is our research and development organization, Accenture Technology Labs, which identifies and develops new technologies that we believe will be the drivers of our clients growth and enable them to be first to market with unique capabilities.Some of the key areas in which our research and development efforts and investments are focused include mobility, cloud computing, business analytics, digital marketing, information management and smart grid.

Competition We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services competitive with those we offer. We compete with a variety of companies, including:  Off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India or China, that offer services similar to those we offer, often at highly competitive prices and on more aggressive terms;  Large multinational providers, including the service arms of large global technology providers (hardware and software), that offer some or all of the services that we do; 13 Table of Contents  Niche solution or service providers or local competitors that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including companies that provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models; and  Accounting firms that are expanding or re-emphasizing their provision of some consulting services, including through acquisitions.

14 Table of Contents Organizational Structure On September1, 2009, Accenture Ltd completed a transaction in which Accenture plc, organized in Ireland, became the parent holding company of Accenture. This transaction is described below under History.
Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company with no material assets other than ClassI common shares in its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares (Accenture SCA). Accenture plcs only business is to hold these shares. Accenture plc owns a majority voting interest in Accenture SCA. As the general partner of Accenture SCA and as a result of Accenture plcs majority voting interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc controls Accenture SCAs management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCAs results in its Consolidated Financial Statements. We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture SCA. Accenture SCA generally reimburses Accenture plc for its expenses but does not pay Accenture plc any fees. Accenture plc was elected the general partner of Accenture SCA in place of Accenture Ltd at the November16, 2009 shareholder meeting of Accenture SCA.
History Prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001, we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners. In connection with our transition to a corporate structure, our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares or, in the case of partners in certain countries, Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA. Generally, partners who received Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd ClassX common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights. The combination of the Accenture Ltd ClassX common shares and the Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares.
In fiscal 2005, we replaced the internal use of the partner title with the more comprehensive senior executive title and applied the senior executive title to our highest-level employees, including those previously referred to as partners. However, for proper context, we continue to use the term partner in certain situations and particularly when discussing our reorganization and the period prior to our incorporation.
On June10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction). On August5, 2009, the shareholders of Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, voted in favor of the Transaction. The Transaction was subsequently completed on September1, 2009, following approval from the Supreme Court of Bermuda, at which time Accenture Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company. In the Transaction, all of the outstanding ClassA and Class X common shares of Accenture Ltd were cancelled and Accenture plc issued ClassA and Class X ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the cancelled Accenture Ltd ClassA and Class X common shares, as applicable (and cash for any fractional shares). Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December29, 2009.
ClassA ordinary shares of the Irish company, Accenture plc, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September1, 2009 under the symbol ACN, the same symbol under which ClassA common shares of Accenture Ltd, its predecessor, were previously listed. Prior to September1, 2009, the effective date of the Transaction, Accenture plc was a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture Ltd and had no substantive operating activity.
15 Table of Contents The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report with respect to periods prior to September1, 2009 reflect the consolidated operations of Accenture Ltd (the predecessor registrant of Accenture plc) and its subsidiaries. The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report reflect the ownership interests in Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain of our current and former senior executives as noncontrolling interests. The noncontrolling ownership interests percentage was 11% as of August31, 2010.
Accenture plc ClassA and ClassX Ordinary Shares Each ClassA ordinary share and each ClassX ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc. A ClassX ordinary share does not, however, entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc. As described above under History, Class X ordinary shares generally provide the holders of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares with a vote at Accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by Accenture plc ClassA common shareholders, while their economic rights consist of interests in Accenture SCA Class I common shares or in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares.
Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any ClassX ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the ClassX ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share. Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture CanadaHoldings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any ClassX ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of ClassX ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder. Accenture plc will redeem ClassX ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of ClassX ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. ClassX ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.
A transfer of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. Other transfers of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the ClassA ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer.
Accenture SCA ClassI Common Shares Only Accenture and our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees hold Accenture SCA ClassI common shares. Each ClassI common share entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to the shareholders of Accenture SCA and entitles its holder to dividends and liquidation payments. As of October12, 2010, Accenture holds a voting interest of approximately 89% of the aggregate outstanding Accenture SCA Class I common shares entitled to vote, with the remaining 11% of the voting interest held by our current and former senior executives.
Accenture SCA is obligated, at the option of the holder, to redeem any outstanding Accenture SCA ClassI common share at a redemption price per share generally equal to its current market value as determined in accordance with Accenture SCAs articles of association. Under Accenture SCAs articles of association, the market value of a ClassI common share that is not subject to transfer restrictions will be deemed to be equal to (i)the average of the high and low sales prices of an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other designated market on 16 Table of Contents which the ClassA ordinary shares trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs, or (ii)if Accenture plc sells its ClassA ordinary shares on the date that the redemption price is determined (other than in a transaction with any employee or an affiliate or pursuant to a preexisting obligation), the weighted average sales price of an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other market on which the ClassA ordinary shares primarily trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs. Accenture SCA may, at its option, pay this redemption price with cash or by delivering Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. This one-for-one redemption price and exchange ratio will be adjusted if Accenture plc holds more than a de minimis amount of assets (other than its interest in Accenture SCA and assets it holds only transiently prior to contributing them to Accenture SCA) or incurs more than a de minimis amount of liabilities (other than liabilities for which Accenture SCA has a corresponding liability to Accenture plc). We have been advised by our legal advisors in Luxembourg that there is no relevant legal precedent in Luxembourg quantifying or defining the term de minimis.
In the event that a question arises in this regard, we expect that management will interpret de minimis in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time in question. At this time, Accenture plc does not intend to hold any material assets other than its interest in Accenture SCA or to incur any material liabilities such that this one-for-one redemption price and exchange ratio would require adjustment and will disclose any change in its intentions that could affect this ratio. In order to maintain Accenture plcs economic interest in Accenture SCA, Accenture plc generally will acquire additional Accenture SCA common shares each time additional Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares are issued.
At the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Accenture SCA to be held on November15, 2010, the shareholders of Accenture SCA will be asked to vote on an amendment to the definition of Valuation Ratio contained in Article 24 of Accenture SCAs articles of association. This amendment will fix the ratio used for determination of the redemption price or number of shares of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares to be issued upon a redemption of Class I common shares from the Limited Shareholders (as defined in the articles of association). The definition of Valuation Ratio originally contained in Article 24 had the effect of limiting the flexibility of Accenture plc (and its predecessor), the general partner of Accenture SCA, because it provided that if a material amount of separate assets or liabilities were acquired, including from Accenture SCA, or liabilities were incurred by Accenture plc (or its predecessor), then the Valuation Ratio was subject to adjustment in order to reflect the relative fair market values of an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share and a Class I common share of SCA. This adjustment would not be made pursuant to a pre-determined formula, but rather would occur using a process for equitable adjustment to be agreed upon by the general partner of Accenture SCA as well as the shareholders or a third party arbitrator if they could not agree. The nature and methodology of such adjustments were not clearly delineated, and since such adjustments could have potentially affected the value that the Limited Shareholders would receive when they sought to redeem their SCA shares, the general partner did not acquire or incur any separate material assets or liabilities.
The effect of the proposed amendment is to reduce such uncertainty by ensuring that the Valuation Ratio will remain fixed (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments) and therefore facilitate Accenture plcs ability to acquire assets, including from third parties or Accenture SCA, and incur liabilities without the need to consider adjusting the ratio used for determining the number of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares delivered in redemption of, or used to calculate the redemption price for, Class I common shares. After giving effect to the amendment, the ratio shall (except in connection with certain transactions affecting the capital stock of Accenture plc) be one-to-one, such that one share of Accenture plc shall be delivered in redemption or used to calculate the redemption price for each Class I common share of Accenture SCA. Accenture plc and Accenture SCA believe that eliminating this provision at this time will provide Accenture plc with greater flexibility to create a more efficient corporate structure, including by acquiring assets from Accenture SCA, and otherwise engage in transactions that will 17 Table of Contents promote shareholder value. If Accenture plc acquires assets from Accenture SCA, Accenture SCA will need to determine the relative values of the acquired assets and the assets remaining at Accenture SCA. This will expose the Limited Shareholders to the risk that if these determinations do not accurately reflect the current or future values of the assets, the value of the Limited Shareholders interest in Accenture SCA could be adversely affected. However, this risk will be mitigated because the Limited Shareholders will continue to enjoy the benefit of their redemption rights based on a fixed one-to-one ratio for Accenture plc shares, which will allow them to share in the value of the assets that had been acquired from Accenture SCA.
Except in the case of a redemption of ClassI common shares or a transfer of ClassI common shares to Accenture plc or one of its subsidiaries, Accenture SCAs articles of association provide that Accenture SCA ClassI common shares may be transferred only with the consent of the general partner of Accenture SCA. In addition, all holders of ClassI common shares (except Accenture) are precluded from having their shares redeemed by Accenture SCA or transferred to Accenture SCA, Accenture plc or a subsidiary of Accenture plc at any time or during any period when Accenture SCA determines, based on the advice of counsel, that there is material non-public information that may affect the average price per share of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares, if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law, during an underwritten offering due to an underwriters lock-up or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by Accenture SCA or its affiliates for Accenture SCA ClassI common shares until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer (other than to tender the holders Accenture SCA ClassI common shares in the tender offer).
Accenture SCA ClassII and ClassIII Common Shares On November16, 2009, the shareholders of Accenture SCA approved amendments to Accenture SCAs articles of association pursuant to which all of the Class II common shares and Class III common shares of Accenture SCA, which were all held by Accenture, were reclassified into Class I common shares with the same rights as the Class I common shares that existed prior to November16, 2009, as described above under Accenture SCA Class I Common Shares, including being entitled to the payment of cash dividends. This amendment had no effect on the relative economic rights of Accenture plc or the other holders of Accenture SCA Class I common shares.
Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share entitles its holder. The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture or the other shareholders of Accenture SCA.
ITEM1A.
RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) or stock price. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.
18 Table of Contents Our results of operations could be adversely affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity.
Global economic conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve, and negative or uncertain economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability. For example, the global economic downturn that began to affect our business in fiscal 2009 reduced demand for our services and caused clients to request additional price concessions. Changes in global economic conditions could cause our clients or potential clients to reduce or defer their spending on new technologies or initiatives in order to focus on other priorities, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. Growth in the primary markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate, for an extended period of time. Differing patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve may affect demand for our services. On-going economic uncertainties also affect our business in a number of other ways, making it more difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Specifically, if we are unable to forecast client demand for our services accurately, we might be unable to effectively plan for or respond to economic changes. This could result, for example, in not having the appropriate personnel where they are needed, and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. Any of these economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to changes in technology and client demand.
Our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Our growth strategy focuses on driving innovation for our core business as well as through new business initiatives beyond the core business. If we are not able to successfully drive innovation in our services and solutions, our results of operations and ability to grow could be negatively affected. If, in response to client demand, we move work more quickly into our Global Delivery Network than planned, our revenues may be less than we anticipated.
In addition, we operate in a quickly evolving environment. The services or technologies offered by current or future competitors may make our offerings less competitive or obsolete. Technological developments may arise that materially affect the commercial viability of our offerings. If we are unable to anticipate and respond effectively to these technological developments, our ability to obtain or successfully deliver client work may be negatively affected.
The consulting and outsourcing markets are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.
The markets in which we offer our services are highly competitive. We compete with a variety of companies, including:  Off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India or China, that offer services similar to those we offer, often at highly competitive prices and on more aggressive contractual terms;  Large multinational providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers (hardware and software), that offer some or all of the services that we do; 19 Table of Contents  Niche solution or service providers or local competitors that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including companies that provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models; and  Accounting firms that are expanding or re-emphasizing their provision of some consulting services, including through acquisitions.
In addition, a client may choose to use its own resources rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide. Some of our competitors are companies that may have greater financial, marketing or other resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals.
The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways, all of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions, the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities, with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider. Increased competition from companies located in lower-cost locations has put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services, particularly in the outsourcing and systems integration markets, and is likely to continue to do so. Some of our competitors are willing, at times, to price contracts with low or negative margins in an effort to increase market share. Further, if our competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity, they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices.
Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, our competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are Accenture clients. Some of our competitors are more established in emerging markets, and this may make our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging. Additionally, our competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work.
In addition, we may face greater competition from companies that have increased in size or scope as a result of strategic mergers or acquisitions. These transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers, software developers and vendors, and service providers. Within the last two years, we have seen significant consolidation that has resulted in the convergence of products and services that were once offered separately by independent vendors. Our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation. Additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services, software and hardware to clients than we can. If buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to our competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.
Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities. Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:  Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, the government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits or shortfalls, could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.
20 Table of Contents  Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts. If these audits conclude that the costs are not reimbursable, then we will not be allowed to bill for them, or the cost must be refunded to the government if it has already been paid to us. Findings from an audit also could result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed rates for our work, may affect our future profitability or may prevent us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time. In the U.S., pending final audit determinations the government may require us not to bill a percentage of our costs, as the U.S. government is currently doing with respect to certain of our contracts in an amount that is not material to our results of operations. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (the DCAA), routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs and compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), and conduct system reviews, investigations and other inquiries of our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts. Currently, we are being audited by DCAA in relation to our indirect cost submissions with respect to several fiscal years, as well as in relation to CAS and our business systems. If the government auditors find, and the Defense Contract Management Agency (which has administrative authority over our U.S. government contracts) concludes, that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs or may have to refund money that has already been paid to us.
If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities, regardless of their adequacy. An allegation of improper or illegal activity, even if not proven, could result in negative publicity, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to win new contracts or receive contract renewals.
U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations. Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of credible evidence of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government. Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level. Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
Government contracts, and the proceedings surrounding them, are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than contracts with commercial clients. Negative publicity related to our government contracts, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts.
Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.
21 Table of Contents  Terms and conditions of government contracts tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate than those for commercial contracts.
The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients. Additionally, because of their visibility and political nature, government projects may present a heightened risk to our reputation. If any of the risks discussed above were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.
Our business could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our services.
Our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients. Our business model also depends on relationships our senior executives develop with our clients so that we can understand our clients needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs. If a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us, a subcontractor or other third parties who provide services or products for a specific project, or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the clients dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client. In particular, clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors. In addition, negative publicity related to our client services or relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients.
Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts with us.
Many of our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive, project-by-project basis. Although we do not centrally track the termination provisions of our consulting contracts, we estimate that the majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients on short notice, and some without notice. Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12months in duration, and these shorter-duration contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30days notice and without significant cost to the client. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated profits lost upon termination of the contract. Additionally, large client projects often involve multiple contracts or stages, and a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. Terminations, cancellations or delays could result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project, including the business or financial conditions of the client, changes in ownership or management at our clients, changes in client strategies or the economy or markets generally. For example in fiscal 2009, we experienced a higher volume of contract terminations and restructurings as a result of challenging economic conditions, which negatively affected our results of operations. When contracts are terminated, we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to replace the lost revenue, or it may take significant time to replace, with other work or eliminate associated costs in a timely manner. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected.
22 Table of Contents Outsourcing services are a significant part of our business and subject us to additional operational and financial risk.
We earned approximately 43% of our net revenues in fiscal 2010 from our outsourcing services. This portion of our business presents potential operational and financial risks that are different from those of our consulting and systems integration services. Our outsourcing services involve taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients businesses. In some cases, we may deliver those services using client personnel and third-party contracts that are transferred to us. From time to time, however, we assume responsibility for delivering our services using client personnel or client subcontractors who are not transferred to us, and we therefore have less ability to fully control their work and efforts. In addition, we could incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations related to the portions of our clients businesses that are transferred to us. This type of work also presents financial risks to us. Outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts, particularly during the first year of the contract. This could exert downward pressure on our overall gross margins, particularly during the early stages of new outsourcing contracts, which might not be offset by improved performance on contracts in our portfolio that we have been operating for a longer time. Furthermore, we face considerable competition for outsourcing work and our clients are increasingly using intensive contracting processes and aggressive contracting techniques and terms, sometimes assisted by third-party advisors.
In addition, we may face exposure in our outsourcing business if we contribute to internal controls issues of a client. If a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures at the client or impair our clients ability to comply with its own internal control requirements, there is a risk that we could face legal liability. Many of our clients request that we obtain an audit under Statement on Auditing Standards No.70 of the control activities we perform for them when we host or process data belonging to them. We cannot guarantee that we will receive an unqualified opinion in any such audit, and our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion, or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion in a timely manner.
Our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing.
If we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer. The rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including:  general economic and political conditions;  our ability to differentiate, and/or clearly convey the value of, our services;  the pricing practices of our competitors, including the aggressive use by our competitors of off-shore resources to provide lower-cost service delivery capabilities, or the introduction of new services or products by our competitors;  our clients desire to reduce their costs;  our ability to charge higher prices where market demand or the value of our services justifies it;  our ability to accurately estimate, attain and sustain contract revenues, margins and cash flows over long contract periods; and  procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.
23 Table of Contents If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world. Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients and grow and manage our business. We are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers with the skill sets required by our business, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized. Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects, including our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments. If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition. If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability could suffer. The processes and costs associated with recruiting, training and retaining employees, and our need to devote time to business development and other non-chargeable activities, place significant demands on our resources. The mobility of our employees also contributes to the effective operation of our global business model, and increased regulation of immigration or work visas could make this more difficult.
There is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain of our labor needs. Our geographic expansion strategy in our strategic growth markets and other emerging markets depends in part on our ability to attract and retain both business leaders and people with the appropriate delivery skills. Additionally, if demand were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs. At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies. In these situations, we must evaluate voluntary attrition and use increased involuntary terminations and reduced levels of new hiring as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in those geographies.
Our ability to grow our revenues and increase profitability could be adversely affected if we cannot effectively manage employee hiring, assimilation and retention to meet client demand, maintain a favorable utilization rate and achieve an efficient workforce structure.
Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions.
We could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, fail to disclose our financial or other arrangements with our alliance partners, or otherwise breach obligations, to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients. We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines. In addition, the contracting practices of our competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace. We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss. If we cannot or do not perform our obligations, we could face significant legal liability, and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on 24 Table of Contents the scope of our potential liability, because a third party may allege fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections. A failure of a clients system based on our services or solutions could subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations. If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide such solutions and services, and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, or if liability limitations are not enforced, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition to expense, litigation can be lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations, and litigation results can be unpredictable.
If our pricing estimates do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our work, then our contracts could be unprofitable.
Our pricing for all of our services and solutions is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace, which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects to a clients satisfaction, or we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties, our contracts could prove unprofitable or yield lower profit margins than anticipated. Our pricing, cost and profit margin estimates on outsourcing work, and sometimes other types of work, frequently include anticipated long-term cost savings for the client from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract. There is a risk that we will underprice our contracts, fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts. This risk could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
Many of our contracts include performance payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets. This could increase the variability of our revenues and margins.
Many of our contracts include performance clauses that require us to achieve agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could reduce our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms. Additionally, we have a number of contracts in which a portion of our fees or incentives depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients actual levels of business activity. These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.
Our ability to attract and retain business may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.
Our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors. Our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients evaluation of whether to engage our services. We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches or service outages or other delivery failures. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, competitors, vendors, adversaries in legal proceedings, government regulators, as well as members of the investment community and the media. There is a risk that negative information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention 25 Table of Contents efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.
Our alliance relationships may not be successful or may change, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own. Many of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by our alliance partners. See BusinessAlliances. The priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours. As most of our alliance relationships are non-exclusive, our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors. One or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor. If our alliances are less successful, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
Our business model is dependent on our Global Delivery Network, in which Accenture personnel are based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world. Under this strategy, we have continued to shift personnel and processes to locations where we can perform both outsourcing and consulting work at lower cost than in more highly-developed markets such as Western Europe or North America. While these delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery network in India and the Philippines. Concentrating our Global Delivery Network in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control. India and the Philippines have experienced severe weather conditions, including cyclones, typhoons and other storms, which may occur again and could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to our facilities. Additionally, both countries have experienced political instability and worker strikes. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur. If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.
As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
We have offices and operations in 53 countries around the world and provide services to clients in more than 120 countries. In fiscal 2010, approximately 44% of our net revenues were attributable to the Americas region, 44% were attributable to the Europe, Middle East and Africa region (EMEA), and 12% were attributable to the Asia Pacific region. In addition, our Global Delivery Network comprises local Accenture professionals working at client sites around the world as well as more than 50 delivery centers. One aspect of our growth strategy is to continue our geographic expansion in emerging markets, which generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets. If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates, international hostilities, natural disasters, security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected. Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us.
26 Table of Contents Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Although we report our results of operations in U.S.dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S.dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S.dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S.dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items originally denominated in other currencies. Declines in the value of other currencies against the U.S.dollar could cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S.dollars to be lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods. Conversely, increases in the value of other currencies against the U.S.dollar could cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S.dollars to be higher than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods.
In some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which could limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations.
As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services. An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee, against the U.S.dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency, and there can be no assurance that our contractual provisions or our currency hedging activities would offset this impact. This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources. In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk. These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts and risks related to currency fluctuations. We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described in the paragraph below could impact our underlying exposures, perhaps eliminating them. Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place, not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure.
International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations.
Acts of terrorist violence, armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, natural disasters, global health risks or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us. These events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients. By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients. Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients. While we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences, we might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars. If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
27 Table of Contents Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes onerous or conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.
We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, antibribery, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and labor relations. This includes in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations. Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights.
Legislation related to certain non-U.S.corporations has been enacted in various jurisdictions in the United States, none of which adversely affects Accenture. However, additional legislative proposals remain under consideration which, if enacted, could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States in the future. Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions. For example, because outsourcing and systems integration represent a significant portion of our business, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations if we are not able to transfer the affected work to other parts of our Global Delivery Network in a timely manner and without materially impacting our results of operations.
In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations, including the U.S.Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these policies or procedures or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines and suspension or disqualification from U.S.federal contracting, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and Accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached.
We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, alliance partners, and vendors. The breadth and complexity of this infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches. Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
In providing services to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the European Union Directive on Data Protection and various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and 28 Table of Contents number, change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or Accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including an attack by viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, could result in negative publicity, legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We could be subject to liabilities or damage our relationships with clients if our subcontractors or the third parties with whom we partner cannot meet their commitments on time or at all.
Large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our ability to serve our clients and deliver and implement our solutions in a timely manner depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services with large-scale projects or enterprises. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on relationships with our clients and on our results of operations.
Our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.
We cannot be sure that our services and solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions. In a number of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client. Any claims or litigation in this area, whether we ultimately win or lose, could be time-consuming and costly, injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms, or we cannot substitute alternative technology from another source, our operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, in recent years individuals and firms have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies. If a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients, an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages.
29 Table of Contents We could lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others. Third-party suppliers of software, hardware or other intellectual assets could be acquired or sued, and this could disrupt use of their products or services by Accenture and our clients. If our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
We have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success.
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property. Existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours. Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight.
Depending on the circumstances, we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do. In certain situations, we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create, which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients. Any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects.
Changes in our level of taxes, and audits, investigations and tax proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. Furthermore, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable and could materially adversely affect our tax position. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful.
Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity, optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues. This includes executing an increasing amount of our client delivery using geographically distributed workforces in lower-cost locations in our Global Delivery Network. We have also taken 30 Table of Contents actions to reduce certain costs, and these initiatives include, without limitation, ongoing global consolidation of our office space and re-alignment of portions of our non-client-facing workforce to lower-cost locations. There is no guarantee that these, or other, cost-management efforts will be successful, that our efficiency will be enhanced, or that we will achieve desired levels of profitability. If we are not effective in reducing our operating costs in the face of changes in demand or pricing, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
If we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed. We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. In limited circumstances, we also extend financing to our clients. We maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services. Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. Recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected.
We may be subject to criticism, negative publicity and legislative or regulatory action related to our incorporation in Ireland.
Some companies that conduct business in the United States but are domiciled in certain offshore jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over U.S. companies. Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company, and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations. Nonetheless, we could be subject to similar criticism in connection with our incorporation in Bermuda for eight years and current incorporation in Ireland.
Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the U.S. and Ireland, there can be no assurance that legislative or diplomatic action will not be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty. Our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. Congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could subject us to increased taxation. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with the United States.
Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States. While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be enacted in a way to negatively affect Accenture.
If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
As of August31, 2010, we had approximately 204,000employees worldwide. Our size presents significant management and organizational challenges. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain 31 Table of Contents effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge. It takes time for our newer employees to develop the knowledge, skills and experience that our business model requires. In addition, it may become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate to our personnel worldwide our core values, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations. Finally, the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired.
We may not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating other businesses.
We expect to continue our program of pursuing tactical acquisitions designed to enhance our capabilities, expand in emerging markets and other countries or develop new services and solutions. We may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations. Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire. We might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate employees of those businesses into our culture and operations. Accordingly, we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we undertake. We might not achieve our expected return on investment, or may lose money. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.
Consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business.
Companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations, it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients. If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting, systems integration and technology, or outsourcing services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work. The increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us. Any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business.
Our share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict.
Our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors. These factors include:  changes in macroeconomic or political factors unrelated to our business;  general or industry-specific market conditions or changes in financial markets;  announcements by us or our competitors about developments in our business or prospects;  projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts; 32 Table of Contents  changes in our revenues, results of operations and profitability;  our ability to generate enough free cash flow to return cash to our shareholders at historical levels or levels expected by our shareholders; and  our failure to meet our growth and financial objectives, including with respect to revenue and earnings per share growth.
Our results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, making them difficult to predict. Some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include:  the business decisions of our clients to begin to curtail or reduce the use of our services, including in response to economic conditions;  contract delivery inefficiencies, such as those due to poor delivery or changes in forecasts;  seasonality, including number of workdays and holiday and summer vacations;  periodic differences between our clients estimated and actual levels of business activity associated with ongoing work;  the stage of completion of existing projects and/or their termination or restructuring;  our ability to transition employees quickly from completed to new projects;  the introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;  our ability to manage costs, including those for personnel, travel, support services and severance;  our ability to maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our workforces;  acquisition and integration costs related to possible acquisitions of other businesses;  changes in, or the application of changes in, accounting principles or pronouncements under U.S.generally accepted accounting principles, particularly those related to revenue recognition;  currency exchange rate fluctuations;  changes in estimates, accruals or payments of variable compensation to our employees;and  global, regional and local economic and political conditions and related risks, including acts of terrorism.
As a result of any of the above factors, or any of the other risks described in this Item1A. Risk Factors, our share price could be difficult to predict and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future. In addition, if litigation is instituted against us following variability in our share price, we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation, and our share price could be materially adversely affected.
Our share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.
The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent 33 Table of Contents limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected.
We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.
We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S.federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S.courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. The laws of Ireland do however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts. Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the United States judgment. The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy. Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland. Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.
Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Acts 1963 to 2009 of Ireland (the Companies Acts). The Companies Acts differ in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S.corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.
Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances. Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company. Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries. If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.
34 Table of Contents We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders ownership interest in us.
We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:  take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion;  acquire other businesses or assets;  repurchase shares from our shareholders;  develop new services and solutions;or  respond to competitive pressures.
Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders ownership percentage in us. Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.

PROPERTIES We have major offices in the worlds leading business centers, including New York, London, Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid, Chicago, Milan, Tokyo, Sao Paolo, Rome, Bangalore, SanFrancisco, Sydney, Manila and Boston, among others.

Substantially all of our office space is leased under long-term leases with varying expiration dates. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs in the near future.
ITEM3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are involved in a number of judicial and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of our business. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. We do not expect that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
As previously reported, in April 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ) intervened in a civil qui tam action previously filed under seal by two private individuals in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas against Accenture and several of its indirect subsidiaries. The complaint as amended alleges that, in connection with work we undertook for the U.S. federal government, we received payments, resale revenue or other benefits as a result of, or otherwise acted improperly in connection with, alliance agreements we maintain with technology vendors and others in violation of our contracts with the U.S. government and/or applicable law or regulations. Similar suits were brought against other companies in our industry. The suit alleges that these amounts and relationships were not disclosed to the government in violation of the Federal False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Act, among other statutes. The DOJ complaint seeks various remedies including treble damages, statutory penalties and disgorgement of profits. While the complaint does not allege damages with specificity, the amount sought by the DOJ will depend on the theories it pursues and could be significant. The suit could lead to other related proceedings and actions by various agencies of the U.S. government, including potential suspension or debarment proceedings. We intend to defend such matters vigorously and do not believe they will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
35 Table of Contents We currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate, including coverage for professional liability, general liability and management liability. We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form10-K.
We use the terms Accenture, we, the Company, our and us in this report to refer to Accenture plc, an Irish public limited company, and its subsidiaries or, prior to September1, 2009, to Accenture Ltd, a Bermuda exempted company that, on that date, became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc, and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August31. For example, a reference to fiscal 2010 means the 12-month period that ended on August31, 2010. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
We use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year periods foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
Overview Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, credit market conditions and levels of business confidence. Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
Revenues before reimbursements (net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $5.42 billion, compared with $5.15 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, an increase of 5% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency. Although some industries and geographies where we operate continue to be impacted by the economic downturn that began to adversely affect our business in January 2009, overall market demand for our services has improved in recent quarters. Based on new contract bookings recorded in fiscal 2010, we expect growth to continue in most areas of our business. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, four of our five operating groups, including Products, Financial Services, Resources and Communications& High Tech, experienced quarterly year-over-year revenue growth in local currency. Looking forward, we anticipate that the level of growth will vary across segments and geographic regions and between consulting and outsourcing services. In addition, given there is still economic uncertainty in some markets around the world, our ability to effectively respond to changing client demand patterns will be a key driver of our performance.
Net revenues for fiscal 2010 were $21.55 billion, compared with $21.58 billion in fiscal 2009, flat in U.S. dollars and a decrease of 2% in local currency. During fiscal 2010, many of the industries and geographies where we operate continued to be impacted by the economic downturn. This adversely affected our year-over-year consulting and outsourcing revenue growth, primarily in the first half of fiscal 2010.
In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $3.09 billion, compared with $2.91 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, an increase of 6% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency. Consulting net revenues for fiscal 2010 were $12.37 billion, compared with $12.56 44 Table of Contents billion for fiscal 2009, a decrease of 1% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency. Although fiscal 2010 consulting revenues reflect the impact of the economic downturn, overall market demand for our consulting services improved during the second half of fiscal 2010. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and to a greater degree in the fourth quarter, we experienced quarterly year-over-year consulting revenue growth in local currency. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, consulting growth in four of our five operating groups, led by Products and Financial Services, was offset by a decline in Health& Public Service, primarily due to our public service business. We are providing a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network. This trend is resulting in work volume growing faster than revenues, and we expect this to continue in the medium term. Clients continue to focus on initiatives designed to deliver near- and medium-term cost savings and performance improvement. Projects with growth and transformational objectives are returning; however, clients remain cautious, seeking flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting work. In addition, the pricing environment continues to be competitive.
In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $2.33 billion, compared with $2.23 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency. Outsourcing net revenues for fiscal 2010 were $9.18 billion, compared with $9.02 billion for fiscal 2009, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. Overall market demand for our outsourcing services improved during the second half of fiscal 2010, and we are beginning to experience higher volumes and scope expansions on existing contracts. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and to a greater degree in the fourth quarter, we experienced quarterly year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency, with significant growth in Products. However, our outsourcing revenue growth during fiscal 2010 continued to be adversely impacted in three operating groups, primarily in Financial Services and to a lesser extent in Communications& High Tech and Resources, by the higher volume of contract terminations and restructurings that began to affect our business after the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We do not expect the fiscal 2009 contract terminations and restructurings to have a material year-over-year impact to outsourcing revenue growth in future periods. In addition, we are providing a greater proportion of outsourcing services through use of lower-cost resources at reduced price levels.
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower.When compared to fiscal 2009, the U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies in fiscal 2010. This resulted in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue results that were approximately 2% better than our results in local currency for fiscal 2010.
The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, sub-contractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with new outsourcing contracts. Utilization represents the percentage of our consulting professionals time spent on billable work. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was approximately 86%, flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, a decrease from 88% for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and more in line with our target range. This level of utilization reflects continued demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network as well as an increase in demand in certain countries, including the United States. We are actively hiring to meet current and projected future demand.
Our cost-management strategies include anticipating changes in demand for our services and executing cost-management initiatives. We aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs and take 45 Table of Contents actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. These cost-management strategies also include executing an increasing amount of our client delivery from our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations. Based on current and projected future demand, we increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 204,000 as of August31, 2010, compared with approximately 177,000 as of August31, 2009. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was 17%, flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and more in line with historical levels prior to the economic downturn. This compares with 10% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We adjust levels of new hiring, evaluate voluntary attrition and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand. In addition, we also adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees, and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future. Compensation increases for fiscal 2011, which for the majority of our personnel were effective September1, 2010, are higher than in the prior fiscal year. As in prior fiscal years, we expect to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of this on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to hire sufficient employees with the skills and background where they are needed, manage attrition, recover increases in compensation and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was 34.0%, compared with 32.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Gross margin for fiscal 2010 was 33.6%, compared with 31.7% for fiscal 2009. As discussed more fully below, the primary driver for the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2010 was a change related to the implementation of our sales-effectiveness model, which directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business-development activities and streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities.
Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 20.9% for the fourth quarter fiscal 2010, compared with 19.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 20.1% for fiscal 2010, compared with 18.3% for fiscal 2009. Sales and marketing is driven primarily by compensation costs for business-development activities, investment in service offerings, and marketing- and advertising-related activities. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate, to maintain or lower these costs as a percentage of revenues.These actions include performing a greater proportion of these activities in lower-cost locations.During fiscal 2010, we directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business-development activities and we streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities.The combination of these two factors has resulted in a greater amount of payroll costs for our client-services personnel being directed to sales and marketing rather than to other activities, which are typically captured in cost of services. We have not reclassified fiscal 2009 amounts to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation, as it would be impractical to do so. The increase in sales and marketing in fiscal 2010 was partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues, primarily due to expense savings resulting from the global consolidation of office space in fiscal 2009. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, general and administrative costs included a bad debt provision of $72 million, which reflected our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables, particularly from clients in high-risk industries or with potential liquidity issues. Our margins could be adversely affected if our cost-management actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues.
46 Table of Contents Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $714 million, compared with $420 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was 13.2%, compared with 8.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Operating income for fiscal 2010 was $2,915 million, compared with $2,644 million for fiscal 2009. Operating margin for fiscal 2010 was 13.5%, compared with 12.3% for fiscal 2009. Restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2010 increased 10 basis points compared with fiscal 2009.
Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for net revenues. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Bookings and Backlog New contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $6.51 billion, with consulting bookings of $3.54 billion and outsourcing bookings of $2.97 billion. New contract bookings for fiscal 2010 were $24.98 billion, with consulting bookings of $13.62 billion and outsourcing bookings of $11.36 billion.
We provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. However, new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. Clients are seeking flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting consulting work, which is resulting in smaller initial total contract values than in the past. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. New contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New contract bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from 47 Table of Contents those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.
Revenue Recognition Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.
We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB101), as amended by SABNo.104, Revenue Recognition (SAB104). We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.
Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SAB101, as amended by SAB104. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.
48 Table of Contents Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs.
Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided.
Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the elements relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.
Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.
Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
49 Table of Contents Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.
We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with FASB guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.
No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.
As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.
50 Table of Contents Revenues by Segment/Operating Group Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications& High Tech, Financial Services, Health& Public Service (formed on September1, 2009, by combining various healthcare-related components of our Products operating group with our Public Service operating group), Products and Resources. Operating groups are managed on the basis of Net revenues because our management believes Net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.
From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.
While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.

We conduct business in the following countries that individually comprised 10% or more of consolidated net revenues within fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 United States 36 % 36 % 34 % United Kingdom 10 10 12 52 Table of Contents Net Revenues Operating Groups The following net revenues by operating group commentary discusses local currency net revenues changes in aggregate for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009:  Communications& High Tech net revenues decreased 7% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined significantly in local currency, primarily due to declines across all industry groups in EMEA and Asia Pacific. While the fiscal 2010 consulting revenues reflected a decline, strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter partially offset revenue declines in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. The consulting revenue decline reflected some clients continuing to seek flexibility by shifting to a more phased approach to contracting work and focusing on managing the scope of existing projects. Outsourcing revenues declined modestly in local currency, primarily due to a significant decline in Communications in Americas, partially offset by growth in Electronics& High Tech in Americas and Asia Pacific and Media& Entertainment in EMEA and Americas. Client strategy changes, which began in fiscal 2009, particularly in Communications, resulted in a number of contract modifications, which had a negative impact on outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2010.
Financial Services net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 more than offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Consulting revenues increased in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Banking across all geographic regions and Capital Markets in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by declines in Insurance in EMEA and Americas. Outsourcing revenues declined significantly in local currency, primarily due to declines in Banking in EMEA and Americas, partially offset by growth in Insurance in EMEA. Modest year-over-year outsourcing growth in the fourth quarter partially offset revenue declines in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. Client consolidations and strategy changes that resulted in contract terminations in fiscal 2009 had a negative impact on our outsourcing revenue in fiscal 2010.
Health& Public Service net revenues declined 4% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined in local currency, primarily due to a decline in Public Service in Americas, principally due to the impact of inefficient delivery on a contract, and declines in Health in Americas and EMEA and Public Service in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues increased modestly in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Americas in Health and Public Service. In addition, the growing uncertainty and challenges in the public sector, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom and several other countries in Europe, continue to have a significant impact on demand in our public service business throughout the world. The uncertainty of the economic situation resulted in longer sales cycles and a shift to a more phased approach to contracting work, with a focus on near-term cost savings rather than large transformational projects. These trends had a negative impact on our revenues and new contract bookings during fiscal 2010 and we expect this trend to continue.
Products net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 more than offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Consulting revenues declined modestly in local currency, primarily due to declines in EMEA and Americas across all industry groups except Consumer Goods& Services, which experienced significant growth in Americas. Consulting revenues reflected the continuation of the more conservative spending patterns of our clients, which began in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. In addition, consulting revenues were negatively impacted by a significant reduction in revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 at two large clients as a result of completing several large projects and transitioning from front-end consulting to outsourcing services. Outsourcing revenues increased in 53 Table of Contents local currency, primarily driven by growth across all geographic regions and across all industry groups except Retail in Americas and Asia Pacific.
Resources net revenues decreased 2% in local currency. While the fiscal 2010 net revenues reflected a decline, year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 partially offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Consulting revenues declined modestly in local currency, primarily due to declines in EMEA across all industry groups and in Utilities in Americas and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in Energy in Americas. Consulting revenues were impacted by our clients continued caution in launching new programs as well as their focus on slowing the pace of existing projects. Outsourcing revenues increased modestly in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Energy in Americas and Natural Resources in Asia Pacific, partially offset by declines in Utilities and Chemicals in Americas.
Geographic Regions  Americas net revenues decreased 1% in local currency. While the fiscal 2010 net revenues reflected a decline, year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010, particularly in the United States, partially offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. We experienced declines in local currency across most countries in Americas, principally due to decreases in the United States and Brazil.
EMEA net revenues decreased 4% in local currency. While the fiscal 2010 net revenues reflected a decline, year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 partially offset revenue declines in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. We experienced declines in local currency across many countries in EMEA, principally due to decreases in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy and France. These declines were partially offset by growth in several countries, led by the United Kingdom.
Asia Pacific net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 more than offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Growth in local currency was principally driven by our business in Singapore and Malaysia, partially offset by declines in Australia and Japan.
Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2010 were $20,179 million, a decrease of $348 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 87.4% from 88.6% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2010 were $18,636 million, a decrease of $297 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.5% from 87.7% during this period.
Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2010 was $15,843 million, a decrease of $487 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 68.6% from 70.5% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2010 was $14,300 million, a decrease of $436 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 66.4% from 68.3% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2010 increased to 33.6% from 31.7% for fiscal 2009. The primary driver for the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2010 was a change related to the implementation of our sales-effectiveness model, which directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business-development activities and streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities. See Overview.
54 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2010 was $2,658 million, an increase of $499 million, or 23%, from fiscal 2009, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 12.3% from 10.0% during this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by a change related to the implementation of our sales-effectiveness model, which directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business-development activities and streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities. See Overview.
General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2010 were $1,668 million, a decrease of $120 million, or 7%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 7.7% from 8.3% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the $72 million bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, as well as expense savings resulting from the global consolidation of office space in fiscal 2009.
Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net We recorded restructuring costs of $253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. These costs included $111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and $142 million related to realignment of our workforce, primarily at the senior-executive level, to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future.
We recorded net reorganization costs of $10million for fiscal 2010, compared with net reorganization benefits of $3million for fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August31, 2010, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $272million, of which $262million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12months. However, resolution of current tax audits, initiation of additional audits or litigation may delay final settlements. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
55 Table of Contents Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2010 was $2,915 million, an increase of $271 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2009, and increased as percentage of net revenues to 13.5% from 12.3% during this period. The restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs in fiscal 2009, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2010 increased 10 basis points compared with fiscal 2009.

We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income during fiscal 2010 was similar to that disclosed for Net revenues. In fiscal 2009, each operating group recorded a portion of the $72 million bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter and 56 Table of Contents the $253 million restructuring cost recorded in the fourth quarter. Additionally, in fiscal 2010, each operating group experienced expense savings resulting from the global consolation of office space in fiscal 2009. See General and Administrative Costs and Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net. The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009, exclusive of foreign currency exchange rates, bad debt provision and restructuring cost impacts.
Communications& High Tech operating income decreased, primarily due to revenue declines and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, offset by improved outsourcing contract profitability.
Financial Services operating income increased, primarily driven by consulting revenue growth, improved utilization and outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by a decline related to lower outsourcing revenues.
Health& Public Service operating income decreased, primarily due to inefficient delivery on a few consulting contracts, higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues and lower consulting contract profitability. In addition, fiscal 2009 results were favorably impacted by the resolution of a contract termination.
Products operating income was flat, as an increase related to higher outsourcing revenues was offset by a decline related to lower consulting revenues, lower consulting contract profitability and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues.
Resources operating income increased, primarily driven by improved utilization, partially offset by a decline related to lower consulting revenues.
Interest Income Interest income was $30million in fiscal 2010, a decrease of $20million, or 40%, from fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates.
Other Expense, net Other expense, net was $16 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $12 million from fiscal 2009. The change was driven by higher net foreign currency exchange losses during fiscal 2010.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates for fiscal 2010 and 2009 were 29.3% and 27.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate increased in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of lower benefits related to adjustments to prior-year tax liabilities in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009, partially offset by changes in the geographic distribution of income.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See BusinessOrganizational Structure. The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $280 million in fiscal 2010, a decrease of $68 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 13% for fiscal 2010 from 17% for fiscal 2009.
57 Table of Contents Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.66 for fiscal 2010, compared with $2.44 for fiscal 2009. The $0.22 increase in fiscal 2010 earnings per share compared with fiscal 2009 earnings per share was primarily due to the following: a $0.24 increase reflecting the impact of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter last year; a $0.07 increase from a lower share count; and a $0.06 increase from favorable foreign exchange rates. These increase were partially offset by the following: a $0.04 decrease from lower revenue and operating income in local currency; a $0.01 decrease from lower reorganization benefits; a $0.03 decrease from lower non-operating items; and a $0.07 decrease from a higher effective income tax rate. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

58 Table of Contents Net Revenues Since January 2009, our business was affected by the continuing global economic downturn. Many clients delayed new large consulting commitments, slowed the pace of on-going projects and reduced requests for incremental projects. In addition, in response to clients seeking to reduce operating costs with requests for price concessions, where practicable, we shifted to lower-cost resources at a reduced price level. As a result, most of our operating groups experienced either declines in or lower local currency growth in consulting revenues beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Consulting revenues declined 12% in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, primarily due to declines in Communications& High Tech of 26%, Products of 23%, Financial Services of 12% and Resources of 5%, partially offset by local currency growth in Health& Public Service of 11%. In addition, most of our operating groups experienced lower local currency growth in outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2009, compared with fiscal 2008. In the fourth quarter, outsourcing revenue growth in local currency slowed to 1%, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as growth in Products of 8%, Resources of 5% and Health& Public Service of 5% was offset by declines in Financial Services of 8% and Communications& High Tech of 2%.
Operating Groups The following net revenues by operating group commentary discusses local currency revenues changes for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008:  Communications& High Tech net revenues decreased 4% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined 11% in local currency, with growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, more than offset by year-over-year contraction during the last three quarters. The aggregate local currency decline was due to declines across all industry groups in Americas and EMEA. These declines were partially offset by consulting growth across all industry groups in Asia Pacific. Client strategy changes, particularly in Communications, have resulted in a number of contract modifications in fiscal 2009, which had a negative impact on consulting revenues in fiscal 2009 and continued to have a negative impact in fiscal 2010. Outsourcing revenues increased 4% in local currency, primarily driven by growth across all industry groups in Asia Pacific and in Electronics& High Tech and Media& Entertainment in EMEA, partially offset by a decline in Communications in EMEA.
Financial Services net revenues decreased 6% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined 11% in local currency, primarily due to declines in Banking in EMEA and, to a lesser extent, in Insurance and Capital Markets in Americas. These declines were partially offset by consulting growth in Banking in the Americas region and in Capital Markets in EMEA. Outsourcing revenues increased 2% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Banking in EMEA and in Insurance in Americas and Asia Pacific, partially offset by declines in Capital Markets in Americas and EMEA. Client strategy changes and consolidations in the financial services industry resulted in a number of outsourcing contract terminations, which had a negative impact on our revenues, contributing to a decline in outsourcing revenues during the second half of fiscal 2009.
Health& Public Service net revenues increased 8% in local currency. Consulting and outsourcing revenues increased 11% and 4% in local currency, respectively. Growth was primarily in Americas and EMEA.
Products net revenues decreased 1% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined by 8% in local currency, with growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, more than offset by year-over-year contraction during the last three quarters. The aggregate local currency decline was primarily due to declines in EMEA across all industry groups except Retail and in Americas across all industry 59 Table of Contents groups except Consumer Goods& Services. Outsourcing revenues increased 11% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Consumer Goods& Services and Transportation& Travel Services across all geographic regions.
Resources net revenues increased 8% in local currency. Consulting revenues increased 7% in local currency, with strong growth in the first half of fiscal 2009, partially offset by year-over-year contraction during the second half. The aggregate growth was led by Utilities in EMEA and Natural Resources in Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in Chemicals in the EMEA. Outsourcing revenues increased 8% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Utilities and Energy in EMEA and growth in Utilities in Americas.
Geographic Regions  Americas net revenues were flat in local currency. We experienced growth in local currency in Brazil, driven by strong growth during the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, which moderated to flat growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This growth was offset by declines in the United States and Canada, where growth early in the year was more than offset by lower growth and/or declines that began in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
EMEA net revenues decreased 2% in local currency. In general, growth moderated or declined across EMEA beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, led by declines in local currency in the United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, Ireland and Sweden. In the Netherlands and Germany we experienced growth in local currency for the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, partially offset by a fourth quarter decline in Germany and flat growth in the Netherlands.
Asia Pacific net revenues increased 12% in local currency. Growth in local currency was principally driven by our business in Australia and Singapore. InJapan we experienced growth in local currency for the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, partially offset by a fourth quarter decline.
Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2009 were $20,527 million, a decrease of $1,775 million, or 8%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 88.6% from 88.1% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2009 were $18,933 million, a decrease of $1,442 million, or 7%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 87.7% from 87.1% during this period.
Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2009 was $16,330 million, a decrease of $1,798 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 70.5% from 71.6% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2009 was $14,736 million, a decrease of $1,465 million, or 9%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.3% from 69.3% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2009 was 31.7%, an increase from 30.7% in fiscal 2008, driven primarily by improved overall outsourcing contract profitability.
Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2009 was $2,159 million, a decrease of $111 million, or 5%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.0% from 9.7% over this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to an increase in selling costs as a percentage of net revenues.
60 Table of Contents General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2009 were $1,789 million, a decrease of $92 million, or 5%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 8.3% from 8.0% over this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 of $72 million, or 0.3% of net revenues. This provision reflects our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables, in light of global economic conditions, particularly from clients in high-risk industries or with potential liquidity issues.
Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net We recorded restructuring costs of $253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. These costs included $111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and $142 million related to realignment of our workforce, primarily at the senior-executive level, to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future.
We recorded net reorganization benefits of $3million for fiscal 2009, which included a $16 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by $13 million of interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities. We recorded net reorganization costs of $23million for fiscal 2008, related to interest expense associated with carrying the liabilities. In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. For additional information, refer to Note3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2009 was $2,644 million, a decrease of $368 million, or 12%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as percentage of net revenues to 12.3% from 12.9% during this period. The restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2009 increased 50 basis points compared with fiscal 2008.

While we saw our net revenues contract, due to both the global economic downturn and significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we improved our gross margins by focusing on contract profitability, particularly in our outsourcing business. This improvement was partially offset by higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues. In addition, each operating group recorded a portion of the $72 million bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and a portion of the $253 million restructuring cost. See General and Administrative Costs and Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net. During fiscal 2009, we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign-exchange rates on our operating income is similar to that disclosed for net revenues. The operating group commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2009, compared to fiscal 2008, exclusive of foreign currency exchange rate, bad debt provision and restructuring impacts.
Communications& High Tech operating income increased due to improved outsourcing and consulting contract margins, offset by consulting revenue declines. In addition, fiscal 2008 reflected the impact of delivery inefficiencies on a small number of consulting contracts.
Financial Services operating income decreased, primarily due to consulting revenue declines, a lower proportion of high-margin consulting work and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by improved outsourcing contract margins.
Products operating income decreased due to declines in consulting revenue and consulting contract margins, early-stage work at lower margins on a few large contracts in the fourth quarter and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by improved outsourcing contract margins.
Public Service operating income increased due to resolution of a contract termination and improved delivery efficiencies compared with fiscal 2008 and consulting revenue growth.
62 Table of Contents  Resources operating income increased due to revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract margins, partially offset by higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues.
Interest Income Interest income was $50million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $65million, or 56%, from fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates for fiscal 2009 and 2008 were 27.6% and 29.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower expenses related to tax rate changes and other adjustments to prior-year tax liabilities required in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See BusinessOrganizational Structure. The resulting Net income of Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $348million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $157million, or 31%, from fiscal 2008. The change was due to a $259 million decrease in Net income and a reduction in the Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average minority ownership interests to 17% for fiscal 2009 from 22% for fiscal 2008.
Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.44 for fiscal 2009, compared with $2.65 for fiscal 2008. The $0.21 decrease in our earnings per share was primarily the result of $253 million in pre-tax restructuring costs, which reduced earnings per share by $0.24.Absent the restructuring costs, earnings per share increased $0.03 compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following:Increases of $0.11 from growth in revenues and operating income in local currency, $0.11 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, and $0.06 from a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.20 from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, compared with fiscal 2008, and $0.05 from other items, including reorganization benefits and non-operating items. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to:  take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion;  acquire complementary businesses or technologies;  develop new services and solutions; or  facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of Accenture shares.
63 Table of Contents As of August31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents was $4,838million, compared with $4,542 million as of August31, 2009, an increase of $297million. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 2010to2009 Change(1) (in millions of U.S. dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,092 $ 3,160 $ 2,803 $ (69 ) Investing activities (274 ) (245 ) (324 ) (29 ) Financing activities (2,429 ) (1,850 ) (2,162 ) (579 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (92 ) (126 ) (29 ) 34 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 297 $ 939 $ 288 $ (642 ) (1) May not total due to rounding.
Operating activities: The $69million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a net use of cash related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher net income.
Investing activities: The $29million increase in cash used was primarily due to lower net proceeds from available-for-sale investments and increased spending on business acquisitions, partially offset by lower spending on property and equipment.
Financing activities: The $579million increase in cash used was primarily due to increases in cash dividends paid and net purchases of shares. For additional information, see Note13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.
Borrowing Facilities As of August31, 2010, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: FacilityAmount Borrowings Under Facilities (in millions of U.S. dollars) Syndicated loan facility(1) $ 1,200 $  Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities(2) 369  Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit(3) 147  Total $ 1,716 $  (1) This facility, which matures on July31, 2012, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. We continue to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. As of August31, 2010 and 2009, we had no borrowings under the facility. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees.
64 Table of Contents (2) We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local-currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of August31, 2010 and 2009, we had no borrowings under these facilities. During fiscal 2010, we had no material borrowings under the facilities.Based on the average annual balances, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under these multicurrency credit facilities and lines of credit was approximately 4% in fiscal 2009.
(3) We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of August31, 2010 and 2009, we had no borrowings under these various facilities.
Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $152million and $172million of letters of credit outstanding as of August31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, we had total outstanding debt of $2 million and $1 million as of August31, 2010 and 2009.
Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares, Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees.
A summary of our share purchase activity during fiscal 2010 is as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture SCA Class I CommonSharesand Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.
Exchangeable Shares Total Shares Amount Shares Amount Shares Amount (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Open-market share purchases(1) 24,940,402 $ 986  $  24,940,402 $ 986 Other share purchase programs   23,152,567 945 23,152,567 945 Other purchases(2) 3,666,119 139   3,666,119 139 Total(3) 28,606,521 $ 1,125 23,152,567 $ 945 51,759,088 $ 2,071 (1) We conduct a publicly announced, open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees.
(2) During fiscal 2010, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares under those plans.
(3) May not total due to rounding.
As of August31, 2010, our aggregate available authorization was $2,920 million for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program and the other share purchase programs.
We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2011. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, the companys ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted, and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.
65 Table of Contents Other Share Redemptions During fiscal 2010, we issued 3,977,356 Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the registration statement). The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by our senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees.
Subsequent Developments On September29, 2010, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.45 per share on our ClassA ordinary shares payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on October15, 2010. Accenture plc will cause Accenture SCA to declare a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.45 per share on its ClassI common shares payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on October12, 2010. Both dividends are payable on November15, 2010.
Obligations and Commitments As of August31, 2010, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Contractual Cash Obligations(1)(2) Total Lessthan 1 year 1-3years 3-5years Morethan 5 years (in millions of U.S. dollars) Long-term debt $ 2 $ 1 $  $  $ 1 Operating leases 1,846 407 499 327 613 Retirement obligations(3) 119 16 24 23 56 Purchase obligations and other commitments(4) 166 62 71 30 3 Total $ 2,133 $ 486 $ 594 $ 380 $ 673 (1) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, refer to Note9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
(2) In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August31, 2010, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $272 million, of which $262 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12months. The reorganization liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and/or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
(3) Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May15, 2001.
(4) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.
66 Table of Contents Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the clients claim. Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.
For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements On September1, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on business combinations. The guidance establishes principles and requirements for: recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; expensing acquisition-related costs as incurred; and determining what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The adoption of the guidance on business combinations did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
On September1, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the FASB on noncontrolling interests, which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, previously referred to as minority interest, to be presented as a separate component in the shareholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As required, the guidance on noncontrolling interests was applied prospectively with the exception of presentation and disclosure requirements, which were applied retrospectively for all periods presented.
New Accounting Pronouncements In September2009, the FASB issued amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. The new guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation in previous guidance and requires that arrangement considerations be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price. The new guidance requires that a vendor use estimates of a selling price developed in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis for all deliverables that meet the remaining separation criteria when vendor-specific objective evidence and third-party evidence, respectively, do not exist as estimates of selling price. This guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.
Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.
Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedgesprimarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Norwegian Krone, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.S. dollar/ Japanese yen, and U.S. dollar/Danish Kroneare intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedgesU.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.K. pound/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three yearsare intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by Accentures Global Delivery Network.
For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of Services. As of August31, 2010, it is anticipated that $1million of the net gains, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into Cost of Services within the next 12months.
We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S.dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $218million and $180million as of August31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August31, 2010 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.
Equity Price Risk The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.
(b) Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and/or our Board of Directors;and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of any unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K.

We also have audited Accenture plcs internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Accenture plcs management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A(b)). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries as of August31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Accenture plc maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

F-7 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business Accenture plc is one of the worlds leading management consulting, technology services and outsourcing organizations and operates globally with one common brand and business model designed to enable it to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service. Drawing on a combination of industry expertise, functional capabilities, alliances, global resources and technology, Accenture plc delivers competitively priced, high-value services that help clients measurably improve business performance. Accenture plcs global delivery model enables it to provide a complete end-to-end delivery capability by drawing on its global resources to deliver high-quality, cost-effective solutions to clients under demanding timeframes.
Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture plc, an Irish company, and its controlled subsidiary companies (collectively, the Company). Accenture plcs only business is to hold Class I common shares in, and to act as the sole general partner of, its subsidiary, Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares. The Company operates its business through Accenture SCA and subsidiaries of Accenture SCA. Accenture plc controls Accenture SCAs management and operations and consolidates Accenture SCAs results in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
The shares of Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than the Company are treated as a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The noncontrolling interest percentages were 11% and 15% as of August31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Purchases and/or redemptions of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares are accounted for at carryover basis.
All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to the Companys fiscal year, which ends on August31. For example, a reference to fiscal 2010 means the 12-month period that ended on August31, 2010. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of the Companys fiscal year.
Reincorporation in Ireland On June10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of the Companys parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction). On August5, 2009, the shareholders of Accenture Ltd, the Companys predecessor holding company, voted in favor of the Transaction. The Transaction was subsequently completed on September1, 2009, following approval from the Supreme Court of Bermuda, at which time Accenture Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became the Companys parent holding company. In the Transaction, all of the outstanding ClassA and Class X common shares of Accenture Ltd were cancelled and Accenture plc issued ClassA and Class X ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the cancelled Accenture Ltd ClassA and Class X common shares, as applicable. As a result of the Transaction, Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, which were redeemable for, at the Companys election, cash or Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares based on the market price of the Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares at the time of the redemption, are now redeemable for, at the Companys election, cash or Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares based on the market price of the Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share at the time of redemption.
F-8 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) On September1, 2009, also in connection with the Transaction, Accenture plc and Accenture Ltd entered into an Assumption and General Amendment Agreement pursuant to which Accenture Ltd assigned to Accenture plc, and Accenture plc assumed, the Accenture Ltd 2001 Share Incentive Plan (the 2001 SIP) and the Accenture Ltd 2001 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the 2001 ESPP), including all award or grant documents or agreements thereunder. All awards or grants under the equity incentive plans continue to be exercisable, issuable, held, available or vest upon the same terms and conditions as under the awards or grants prior to their assumption by Accenture plc, except that upon the exercise, issuance, holding, availability or vesting of those awards or grants, Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares are now issuable or available, or benefits or other amounts determined, in lieu of Accenture Ltd ClassA common shares. Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December29, 2009.
Use of Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.
Reclassifications Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation. In addition, on September1, 2009, the Company streamlined its approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities. This resulted in a greater amount of payroll costs for the Companys client-services personnel being recorded in Sales and marketing rather than Cost of services. The Company has not reclassified fiscal 2009 or 2008 amounts to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation, as it would be impractical to do so.
Revenue Recognition Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where the Company designs/redesigns, builds and implements new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for its clients are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If the Companys estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.
F-9 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB101), as amended by SABNo.104, Revenue Recognition (SAB104). The Company considers amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, the Companys efforts, measured by time incurred, typically represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, the Company recognizes revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, the Company hires client employees and becomes responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SAB101, as amended by SAB104. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, the Companys effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and the Company concludes the amounts are earned.
Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $508,829 and $521,776 as of August31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Deferred transition revenues were $496,646 and $535,939 as of August31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are included in non-current Deferred revenues relating to contract costs.
Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the elements relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such F-10 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately. Revenues are recognized in accordance with the Companys accounting policies for the separate elements, as described above. Elements qualify for separation when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Companys control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as the Company also sells those elements unaccompanied by other elements.
Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.
Revenues before reimbursements (net revenues) include the margin earned on computer hardware and software, as well as revenues from alliance agreements. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. The Company reports revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.
Employee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.
Income Taxes The Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company establishes liabilities or reduces assets for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes certain tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged. Each fiscal quarter, the Company evaluates these uncertain tax positions and adjusts the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances.
Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts Assets and liabilities of non-U.S.subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S.dollar are translated into U.S.dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.
F-11 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including money market funds of $425,000 and $732,167 as of August31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As a result of certain subsidiaries cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash payables. Such negative balances are classified as Short-term bank borrowings.
Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances The Company records its client receivables and unbilled services at their face amounts less allowances. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its receivables and unbilled services and establishes allowances based on historical experience and other currently available information. As of August31, 2010 and 2009, total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $104,753 and $101,517, respectively. The allowance reflects the Companys best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables and unbilled services, particularly from clients in high-risk industries or with potential liquidity issues. In limited circumstances, the Company agrees to extend financing to certain clients. The terms vary by contract, but generally payment for services is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestones.
Concentrations of Credit Risk The Companys financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments, client receivables and unbilled services, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducts ongoing evaluation of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business. Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.
Investments All liquid investments with an original maturity greater than 90days but less than one year are considered to be short-term investments. Investments with an original maturity greater than one year are considered to be long-term investments. Marketable short-term and long-term investments are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale investments. Available-for-sale investments are reported at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. Quoted market prices are used to determine the fair values of common equity and debt securities that were issued by publicly traded entities. Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in Interest income. Realized gains and losses on securities are determined based on the First In, First Out method and are included in (Loss) gain on investments, net. The Company does not hold these investments for speculative or trading purposes.
F-12 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: Buildings 20to25years Computers, related equipment and software 2 to 7 years Furniture and fixtures 5 to 10 years Leasehold improvements Lesserofleasetermor15years Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future net cash flows. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.
Operating Expenses Selected components of operating expenses were as follows: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 Training costs $ 591,229 $ 794,218 $ 985,929 Research and development costs 383,700 434,937 390,168 Advertising costs 71,157 77,315 91,034 Provision for doubtful accounts(1) 3,345 75,008 1,772 (1) For additional information, see  Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances.
Subcontractor costs are included in Cost of services as they are incurred.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements On September1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on business combinations. The guidance establishes principles and requirements for: recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; expensing acquisition-related costs as incurred; and determining what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The Companys adoption of the guidance on business combinations did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
On September1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance issued by the FASB on noncontrolling interests, which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, previously referred to as minority interest, to be presented as a separate component in the shareholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As required, the guidance on F-13 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) noncontrolling interests was applied prospectively with the exception of presentation and disclosure requirements, which were applied retrospectively for all periods presented.
Subsequent Events The Company has evaluated events and transactions subsequent to the balance sheet date. Based on this evaluation, the Company is not aware of any events or transactions (other than those disclosed elsewhere) that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date but prior to filing that would require recognition or disclosure in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
2.EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 Basic Earnings per share Net income attributable to Accenture plc $ 1,780,656 $ 1,589,963 $ 1,691,751 Basic weighted average Class A ordinary shares 637,170,234 623,007,198 610,949,205 Basic earnings per share $ 2.79 $ 2.55 $ 2.77 Diluted Earnings per share Net income attributable to Accenture plc $ 1,780,656 $ 1,589,963 $ 1,691,751 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada HoldingsInc.(1) 257,636 330,080 485,891 Net income for diluted earnings per share calculation $ 2,038,292 $ 1,920,043 $ 2,177,642 Basic weighted average Class A ordinary shares 637,170,234 623,007,198 610,949,205 Class A ordinary shares issuable upon redemption/exchange of noncontrolling interests(1) 92,279,826 127,461,437 176,064,009 Diluted effect of employee compensation related to Class A ordinary shares(2) 36,294,149 35,899,999 36,922,789 Diluted effect of share purchase plans related to Class A ordinary shares 303,585 138,260 76,717 Diluted weighted average Class A ordinary shares 766,047,794 786,506,894 824,012,720 Diluted earnings per share(2) $ 2.66 $ 2.44 $ 2.64 (1) Diluted earnings per share assumes the redemption of all Accenture SCA Class I common shares owned by holders of noncontrolling interests and the exchange of all Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares, on a one-for-one basis. The income effect does not take into account Net income attributable to noncontrolling interestsother, since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares.
(2) Fiscal 2008 and 2009 diluted weighted average Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares and earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the impact of the issuance of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units in connection with the payment of cash dividends.
For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, 110,294 options, 193,143 options and 53,948 options, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise prices would render them anti-dilutive.
F-14 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 3.RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION COSTS, NET Restructuring The Company recognized restructuring costs of $252,566in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The restructuring costs included $110,338 principally related to global consolidation of office space and $142,228 related to realignment of the Companys workforce, primarily at the senior executive level. The restructuring costs were allocated to the reportable operating segments as follows: $49,192to Communications& High Tech; $53,155 to Financial Services; $45,818 to Health& Public Service; $58,091 to Products; and $46,310 to Resources.
The Companys restructuring activity was as follows: Workforce Realignment Space Abandonment(1) Total Restructuring liability, as of August 31, 2008 $  $ 32,132 $ 32,132 Restructuring costs 142,228 110,338 252,566 Asset impairments  (20,074 ) (20,074 ) Payments made (732 ) (5,744 ) (6,476 ) Other(2) 572 6,923 7,495 Restructuring liability, as of August 31, 2009 $ 142,068 $ 123,575 $ 265,643 Payments made (124,491 ) (35,388 ) (159,879 ) Other(2) (13,030 ) 1,824 (11,206 ) Restructuring liability, as of August 31, 2010 $ 4,547 $ 90,011 $ 94,558 (1) Related to space abandonment recorded in fiscal 2002, 2004 and 2009.
(2) Other represents changes in estimates, imputed interest and foreign currency translation.
The restructuring liabilities as of August31, 2010 were $94,558, of which $28,574 was included in Other accrued liabilities and $65,984 was included in Other non-current liabilities. The remaining liabilities represent the net present value of estimated obligations for operating leases on abandoned office space.
Reorganization In fiscal 2001, the Company accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with its transition to a corporate structure. These liabilities included certain non-income tax liabilities, such as stamp taxes, as well as liabilities for certain individual income tax exposures related to the transfer of interests in certain entities to the Company as part of the reorganization. These primarily represent unusual and disproportionate individual income tax exposures assumed by certain, but not all, of the Companys shareholders and partners in certain tax jurisdictions specifically related to the transfer of their partnership interests in certain entities to the Company as part of the reorganization. (Prior to fiscal 2005, the Company referred to its highest-level employees with the partner title and the Company continues to use the term partner to refer to these persons in certain situations related to its reorganization and the period prior to its incorporation.) The Company identified certain shareholders and partners who may incur such unusual and disproportionate financial damage in certain jurisdictions. These include shareholders and partners who were subject to tax in their jurisdiction on items of income arising from the reorganization transaction that were not taxable for most other shareholders and partners. In addition, F-15 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) certain other shareholders and partners were subject to a different rate or amount of tax than other shareholders or partners in the same jurisdiction. When additional taxes are assessed on these shareholders or partners in connection with these transfers, the Company has made and intends to make payments, and in one country has contractually committed, to reimburse certain costs associated with the assessment either to the shareholder or partner, or to the taxing authority. The Company has recorded reorganization expense and the related liability where such liabilities are probable. Interest accruals are made to cover reimbursement of interest on such tax assessments.
The Companys reorganization activity was as follows: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 Reorganization liability, beginning of period $ 296,104 $ 308,694 $ 401,228 Final determinations(1) (1,999 ) (23,479 ) (86,764 ) Changes in estimates  7,297 86,764 Benefits recorded (1,999 ) (16,182 )  Interest expense accrued 11,537 12,889 22,872 Payments   (143,184 ) Foreign currency translation adjustments (33,735 ) (9,297 ) 27,778 Reorganization liability, end of period $ 271,907 $ 296,104 $ 308,694 (1) Includes final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations.
As of August31, 2010, reorganization liabilities of $261,972 were included in Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months, and reorganization liabilities of $9,935 were included in Other non-current liabilities. Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and/or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution. Final resolution, through settlement, conclusion of legal proceedings or a tax authoritys decision not to pursue a claim, will result in payment by the Company of amounts in settlement or judgment of these matters and/or recording of a reorganization benefit or cost in the Companys Consolidated Income Statement. It is possible the aggregate amount of such payments in connection with resolution of all such proceedings could exceed the currently recorded amounts. As of August31, 2010, only a small number of jurisdictions remain that have active audits/investigations or open statutes of limitations, and only one is significant. In that jurisdiction, current and former partners, and the Company, are engaged in disputes with tax authorities in connection with the corporate reorganization in 2001, some of which have resulted, and other of which are expected to result, in litigation. These individuals and the Company intend to vigorously defend their positions.

In addition, the Company may be required to make payments totaling up to approximately $70,000 over a four-year period that began on September1, 2008, conditional on achieving certain performance measures or periods of service. In connection with these acquisitions, the Company recorded combined goodwill of $212,075, a portion of which was allocated to each of the reportable segments. The Company also recorded $72,005 in intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships and intellectual property. The intangible assets are being amortized over a period of less than one year to fifteen years. The pro forma effects on the Companys operations were not material.
During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded adjustments related to purchase accounting for previous acquisitions. During fiscal 2010, the Companycompleted several individually immaterialacquisitions.
The Company performed impairment tests of goodwill for the three years ended August31, 2010 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment are as follows.

Prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-period presentation.
(2) Additions/Adjustments primarily relate to immaterial acquisitions made during fiscal 2010.
7.DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In the normal course of business, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.
Certain derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. Credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to the Company, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based on the gross fair value of all of the Companys derivative financial instruments, was approximately $29,190 as of August31, 2010. The Company has limited its credit risk by entering into derivative transactions only with highly-rated global financial institutions, limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducting ongoing evaluation of the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business.
F-18 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) The Company also utilizes standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. These provisions may reduce the Companys potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and reduce a counterpartys potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of the Company. Additionally, these agreements contain early termination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterpartys credit rating, thereby enabling the Company to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease the Companys realized loss on an open transaction. Similarly, a decrement in the Companys credit rating could trigger a counterpartys early termination rights, thereby enabling a counterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase the Companys realized loss on an open transaction. The aggregate fair value of the Companys derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position as of August31, 2010 was $22,870.
The Companys derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements. All of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets. Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing. For additional information related the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statement. The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows: August 31, 2010 2009 Notional Value Fair Value Notional Value Fair Value Foreign currency forward contracts: To buy $ 2,402,633 $ 6,747 $ 1,913,263 $ (17,018 ) To sell 187,681 (427 ) 106,962 (403 ) Cash Flow Hedges Certain of the Companys subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of resources supplied by the Companys Global Delivery Network. To mitigate this risk, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future. The Company has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges. As of August31, 2010 and 2009, the Company held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment hedges.
In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedge item, the risk being hedged, the Companys risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the F-19 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. The Company assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges using the Hypothetical Derivative Method, which measures hedge ineffectiveness based on a comparison of the change in fair value of the actual derivative designated as the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative.The hypothetical derivative would have terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item.The Company measures and records hedge ineffectiveness at the end of each fiscal quarter.
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. Amounts reclassified into Cost of services for fiscal 2010 were $9,959 net of taxes. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement and for fiscal 2010 and 2009 was not material. As of August31, 2010, amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss were net gains of $4,340 net of taxes, of which $591 is expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. In addition, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges during fiscal 2010 or 2009.
The fair values of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: August31, 2010 2009 Assets Other current assets $ 10,806 $ 5,596 Other non-current assets 13,962 2,251 Total $ 24,768 $ 7,847 Liabilities Other accrued liabilities $ 9,845 $ 19,227 Other non-current liabilities 5,202 7,157 Total $ 15,047 $ 26,384 Other Derivatives The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts, which have not been designated as hedges, to hedge balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany loans. These instruments are generally short-term in nature, with typical maturities of less than one year, and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives were a net gain of $29,574 and $32,244 for fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.

F-22 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) The components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities included the following: August31, 2010 2009 Deferred tax assets: Pensions $ 224,331 $ 138,251 Revenue recognition 84,110 93,444 Compensation and benefits 336,572 300,814 Share-based compensation 280,509 268,092 Tax credit carryforwards 149,905 44,971 Net operating loss carryforwards 158,302 171,542 Depreciation and amortization 56,865 159,483 Other 175,949 324,288 1,466,543 1,500,885 Valuation allowance (233,260 ) (146,920 ) Total deferred tax assets 1,233,283 1,353,965 Deferred tax liabilities: Revenue recognition (34,415 ) (28,702 ) Depreciation and amortization (44,866 ) (45,728 ) Investments in subsidiaries (137,229 ) (112,906 ) Other (26,167 ) (34,733 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (242,677 ) (222,069 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 990,606 $ 1,131,896 The Company recorded valuation allowances of $233,260 and $146,920 as of August31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, against deferred tax assets principally associated with certain tax net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. For all other deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. During fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a net increase of $86,340 in the valuation allowance. The majority of this change relates to valuation allowances on tax credits, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.
The Company had net operating loss carryforwards as of August31, 2010 of $632,159. Of this amount, $101,570 expires between 2011 and 2016, $51,866 expires between 2017 and 2030, and $478,723 has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company had tax credit carryforwards as of August31, 2010 of $149,905, of which $40,925 will expire between 2011 and 2016, $17,026 will expire between 2017 and 2030, and $91,954 has an indefinite carryforward period.
As of August31, 2010, the Company had $1,254,468 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $703,967, if recognized, would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate. As of August31, 2009, the Company had $1,053,426 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $589,497, if recognized, would favorably affect the Companys effective tax rate. The differences of $550,501 and $463,929, F-23 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) respectively, represent items recorded as adjustments to equity and offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Fiscal 2010 2009 Balance, at beginning of period $ 1,053,426 $ 1,087,001 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 151,008 131,168 Additions for tax positions related to prior years 115,975 13,451 Reductions for tax positions related to prior years (39,772 ) (96,684 ) Statute of limitations expirations (7,611 ) (7,002 ) Settlements with tax authorities (5,038 ) (38,408 ) Cumulative translation adjustment (13,520 ) (36,100 ) Balance, at end of period $ 1,254,468 $ 1,053,426 For the year ended August 31, 2010, substantially all of the additions for tax positions related to prior years are for items that had no net impact to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes. During fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, the Company recognized approximately $42,489, $47,498, and $59,419 in interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $222,499 ($153,719, net of tax benefits) and $190,024 ($131,884, net of tax benefits) on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of August31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal 2003 to 2007. The Company is also currently under audit in numerous state and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, the Company does not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for the years before 2003. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $474,000 or increase by approximately $62,000 in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations and other adjustments. The majority of these amounts relate to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
As of August31, 2010, the Company had not recognized a deferred tax liability on $1,567,405 of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested. If such earnings were distributed, some countries may impose withholding taxes. It is not practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability.
Portions of the Companys operations are subject to reduced tax rates or are free of tax under various tax holidays which expire between fiscal 2011 and 2015. Some of the holidays are renewable at reduced levels, with renewal periods through 2025. The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be approximately $71,000, $78,000 and $71,000 in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

In addition, the Companys U.S.defined benefit pension plans include a frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners, which is unfunded. Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan.
Certain postemployment benefits, including severance benefits, disability-related benefits and continuation of benefits, such as healthcare benefits and life insurance coverage, are provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. These costs are substantially provided for on an accrual basis.
Assumptions The Company uses an August31 measurement date for its U.S.and non-U.S.defined benefit pension plans. The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the fiscal year-end defined benefit pension obligations are as follows: August31, 2010 2009 U.S.Plans Non-U.S.
Plans U.S.Plans Non-U.S.
Plans Discount rate 5.25 % 4.77 % 6.00 % 5.26 % Rate of increase in future compensation 4.00 % 3.68 % 4.00 % 3.32 % The Companys methodology for selecting the discount rate for the U.S.Plans is to match the plans cash flows to that of the average of two yield curves that provide the equivalent yields on zero-coupon corporate bonds for each maturity. The discount rate assumption for the non-U.S.Plans primarily reflects the market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments. The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the Companys defined benefit pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns on defined benefit pension plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio.
Pension Expense Pension expense for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $76,425, $64,400 and $59,355 respectively.

The plans future prospects, their current financial conditions, the Companys current funding levels and other relevant factors suggest that the plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of return in order to achieve long-term objectives without undue risk to the plans ability to meet their current benefit obligations. The Company recognizes that asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plans assets is an important factor in determining long-term performance. Actual asset allocations at any point in time may vary from the target asset allocations and will be dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, required cash flows and investment decisions of the investment committee and the pension plans investment funds and managers. Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing.
Non-U.S. Pension Plans Plan assets in non-U.S.defined benefit pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation. The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers. In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with the Company. Asset allocation decisions are made to provide risk adjusted returns that align with the overall investment strategy for each plan. Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan. In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities. Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy. Defined benefit pension plans in certain countries are unfunded.
Risk Management Plan investments are exposed to certain risks including market, interest rate and operating risk. In order to mitigate significant concentrations of these risks, the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of equities and fixed income instruments. Equities are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds and are intended to achieve long term capital appreciation.To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets are allocated to debt securities which appropriately match the duration of individual plans liabilities. Plan asset allocation and investment managers guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis.

The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including the Companys own credit risk.
The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Companys market assumptions. The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:  Level 1Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;  Level 2Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets; and  Level 3Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.

12.SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Accenture plc Ordinary Shares The Company has 40,000 authorized ordinary shares, par value 1per share. Each ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc; however a holder of an ordinary share is not entitled to vote on matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc or to receive dividends.
ClassA Ordinary Shares An Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. Each ClassA ordinary share entitles its holder to a pro rata part of any dividend at the times and in the amounts, if any, which Accenture plcs Board of Directors from time to time determines to declare, subject to any preferred dividend rights attaching to any preferred shares. Each ClassA ordinary share is entitled on a winding-up of Accenture plc to be paid a pro rata part of the value of the assets of Accenture plc remaining after payment of its liabilities, subject to any preferred rights on liquidation attaching to any preferred shares.
F-34 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ClassX Ordinary Shares An Accenture plc ClassX ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. A ClassX ordinary share does not entitle its holder to receive dividends, and holders of those shares are not entitled to be paid any amount upon a winding-up of Accenture plc. Most of the Companys partners who received Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with the Companys transition to a corporate structure received a corresponding number of Accenture plc ClassX ordinary shares. Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any ClassX ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the ClassX ordinary share. Accenture plc has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any ClassX ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of ClassX ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder, as the case may be. Accenture plc will redeem ClassX ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of ClassX ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. ClassX ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.
Equity of Subsidiaries Redeemable or Exchangeable for Accenture plc ClassA Ordinary Shares Accenture SCA ClassI Common Shares Senior executives in certain countries, including the United States, received Accenture SCA ClassI common shares in connection with the Companys transition to a corporate structure. Only the Company and its current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees hold Accenture SCA ClassI common shares. Each Accenture SCA ClassI common share entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture SCA and entitles its holders to dividends and liquidation payments.
Accenture SCA is obligated, at the option of the holder, to redeem any outstanding Accenture SCA ClassI common share at a redemption price per share generally equal to its current market value as determined in accordance with Accenture SCAs articles of association. Under Accenture SCAs articles of association, the market value of a ClassI common share will be deemed to be equal to (i)the average of the high and low sales prices of an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other designated market on which the ClassA ordinary shares trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs, or (ii)if Accenture plc sells its ClassA ordinary shares on the date that the redemption price is determined (other than in a transaction with any employee or an affiliate or pursuant to a preexisting obligation), the weighted average sales price of an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share on the New York Stock Exchange (or on such other market on which the ClassA ordinary shares primarily trade), net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs. Accenture SCA may, at its option, pay this redemption price with cash or by delivering Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. Each holder of ClassI common shares is entitled to a pro rata part of any dividend and to the value of any remaining assets of Accenture SCA after payment of its liabilities upon dissolution.

Exchangeable Shares Partners resident in Canada and New Zealand received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with the Companys transition to a corporate structure. Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. The Company may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc ClassA ordinary share at the time of the exchange.

13.MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Share Purchase And RedemptionActivity The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for the Companys publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc ClassA ordinary shares, Accenture SCA ClassI common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by the Companys current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees.

Substantially all operating leases are non-cancelable or cancelable only by the payment of penalties. Rental expense in agreements with rent holidays and scheduled rent increases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rental expense, including operating costs and taxes and sublease income from third parties, during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was as follows: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 Rental expense $ 467,838 $ 500,949 $ 521,880 Sublease income from third parties (30,741 ) (33,179 ) (37,625 ) Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases as of August31, 2010, were as follows: Operating Lease Payments Operating Sublease Income 2011 $ 407,008 $ (27,766 ) 2012 284,225 (23,715 ) 2013 214,331 (24,206 ) 2014 173,974 (24,675 ) 2015 153,570 (22,039 ) Thereafter 613,298 (45,695 ) $ 1,846,406 $ (168,096 ) 15.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments The Company has the right to purchase or may also be required to purchase substantially all of the remaining outstanding shares of its Avanade Inc. subsidiary (Avanade) not owned by the Company at fair value if certain events occur. Certain holders of Avanade common stock and options to purchase the stock have put rights that, under certain circumstances and conditions, would require Avanade to redeem shares of its stock at fair value. As of August31, 2010 and August31, 2009, the Company has reflected the fair value of $93,404 and $87,578, respectively, related to Avanades redeemable common stock and the intrinsic value of the options on redeemable common stock in Other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements through which it may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby the Company has joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which the Company agrees to hold the indemnified party harmless F-38 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) with respect to third-party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.
Typically, the Company has contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company in connection with arrangements where third-party nonperformance has given rise to the clients claim. Payments by the Company under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim, which may be disputed by the Company typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.
As of August31, 2010 and August31, 2009, the Companys aggregate potential liability to its clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $556,000 and $508,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $71,000 and $24,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if the Company is obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties that are the consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
To date, the Company has not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. The Company has assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believes that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole.
Legal Contingencies As of August31, 2010, the Company or its present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. The Company and/or its personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of its business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes these matters will not ultimately have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial condition.
16.SEGMENT REPORTING Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
