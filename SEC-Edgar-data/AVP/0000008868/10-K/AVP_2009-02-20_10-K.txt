PART I Dollars in Millions ITEM 1. BUSINESS General Avon   commenced operations in 1886 and was incorporated in the State of New York on January   27, 1916. Avon is a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products.   Avons products fall into three product categories: Beauty, which consists of cosmetics,   fragrances and toiletries (CFT); Beauty Plus, which consists of fashion   jewelry, watches, apparel and accessories; and Beyond Beauty, which consists of    home products, gift and decorative products and candles. Sales from Health and   Wellness products and the mark. brand, described below, are included   among these three categories based on product type.
In 2003, Avon launched in the U.S. a new global cosmetics brand, focusing on the market for young women. The brand is named mark. and the product line is targeted to young women in the 16 to 24 age group, with an objective of enhancing Avons share of the worldwide youth market. The mark. brand is sold both through the Companys core group of Representatives and a separate mark. sales force. The Company intends to introduce mark. into additional markets over the next several years.
Avons business primarily is comprised of one industry segment, direct selling, which is conducted worldwide. The Companys reportable segments are based on geographic operations in four regions: North America, Latin America, 1 Europe and the Pacific. Financial information relating to the reportable segments is incorporated by reference to the analysis of Net sales and Operating profit by geographic area, and to Note 11, Segment Information, in Avons 2003 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are included as Exhibit 13.
Distribution Avon presently has sales operations in 60 countries or territories, including the United States, and distributes its products in 72 more. Sales are made to the ultimate customer principally through a combination of direct selling and marketing by approximately 4.4 million active independent Avon Representatives, approximately 500,000 of whom are in the United States. Representatives are independent contractors or independent dealers, who are not agents or employees of Avon. Representatives purchase products at a discount from the brochure price directly from Avon and sell them to their customers. The Representatives are the customers of Avon and Avon generally has no arrangement with any end user of its product beyond the Representative.
Representatives are invoiced for their order and are responsible for payment to Avon upon delivery of product to the Representative, regardless of whether or not the Representative sells the products to an end user. No single Representative or end user accounts for more than 10% of Avons net sales.
A Representative contacts customers, selling primarily through brochures which highlight new products and specially-priced items for each sales campaign. Sales campaigns are generally for a two-week duration in the United States and three-to-four week duration for most markets outside the United States. Product samples, demonstration products and selling aids such as make-up color charts are also used. Generally, the Representative forwards an order to a designated distribution center. A Representative can place an order 24 hours a day, seven days a week using the mail, the Internet, telephone, or fax. This order is processed and the products are assembled at a distribution center and delivered to the Representative usually by a local delivery service. The Representative then delivers the merchandise and collects payment from the customer for his or her own account. A Representative receives a refund of the full price of a product if the Representative chooses to return it.
Avon   employs certain electronic order systems to increase Representative support, which   allow a Representative to run her or his business more efficiently as well as the   Company to improve  its order-processing accuracy. Additionally, an Avon Representative   can utilize the Internet to manage her or his business electronically. In the U.S.,   certain Avon Representatives use an online marketing tool called youravon.com.   The site helps  Representatives build their own Avon business by enabling them   to sell online a complete line of Avons products 24 hours a day, seven days   a week, through personalized web pages developed in association with Avon. Additionally,   these  e-Representatives have the advantage of business-to-business capabilities   that connect them to Avons order and fulfillment systems. While their customers   benefit from the speed, convenience and delivery flexibility of online ordering,   Avon  e-Representatives are able to promote special products, target specific groups   of customers, place and track orders online, and capitalize on e-mail to share   product information, selling tips and marketing incentives. Self-paced online training   also  is available, as well as up-to-the-minute news about Avon.
Globally, Avon has Internet sites   in 40 markets. Most are consumer information sites, but 23 of these markets have   piloted business-to-business sites to support Representatives. Globally, approximately   500,000  Representatives place orders online.
In the United States, Avon also markets its products through a consumer website, Avon.com. This provides a purchasing opportunity to consumers who choose not to purchase through a Representative. Avon also sells products at the Avon Centre, a spa, salon and retail store located in New York City. The Avon 2 Centre emphasizes health and beauty and offers a selection of Avon beauty products created exclusively for use at the Avon Centre.
In some markets, Avon uses decentralized branches and satellite stores to serve Representatives and customers. Representatives come to a branch to place and pick up product orders for their customers. The branches also create visibility for Avon with consumers and help reinforce the Companys beauty image. In certain markets, Representatives can manage Avon beauty boutiques, beauty counters in department stores, licensed Avon beauty centers and other retail-oriented opportunities to build their careers and bring Avon to new customers in complementary ways to direct selling.
The   recruiting and training of Representatives are the primary responsibilities of   District Sales Managers. District Sales Managers are employees of Avon and are   paid a salary and a sales  incentive based primarily on the increase over the prior   year's sales of Avon products by Representatives in their district. Personal contacts,   including recommendations from current Representatives (including the Sales Leadership   program), and  local advertising constitute the primary means of obtaining new   Representatives. The Sales Leadership program is a multi-level selling system which   gives Representatives the opportunity to earn bonuses from sales of Representatives   they have  recruited and trained, as well as discounts on their own sales. This   program limits the number of levels on which a bonus can be earned to three and   continues to focus on individual product sales by Leadership Representatives. Development   of the  Sales Leadership program throughout the world is part of Avons long-term   growth strategy. Approximately 40% of Avons active Representatives   are a part of a Sales Leadership program. Because of the high rate of turnover   among Representatives, a characteristic of the direct-selling method, recruitment   and training of new Representatives are  continually necessary.
Avon also has a Representative development strategy in the U.S. that focuses on the professional training and development of Representatives through the Avon Beauty Advisor program. Under this program, Representatives enroll in a series of courses designed to enhance their product knowledge and professional beauty consulting skills. Following the termination of Avons retail business relationship with J.C. Penney in the first quarter of 2003, this group of highly trained Avon Beauty Advisors is the exclusive channel through which Avons more upscale line of beauty products called beComing is offered in the U.S.
From time to time, local governments question the legal status of Representatives, usually in regard to possible coverage under social benefit laws that would require Avon (and in most instances, the Representatives) to make regular contributions to government social benefit funds. Although Avon has generally been able to address these questions in a satisfactory manner, the matter has not been fully resolved in all countries. If there should be a final determination adverse to Avon in a country, the cost for future, and possibly past, contributions could be so substantial in the context of the volume and profitability of the business of Avon in that country that the Company would consider discontinuing operations in that country.
Promotion and Marketing Sales   promotion and sales development activities are directed at assisting Representatives,   through sales aids such as brochures, product samples and demonstration products.   In order to support the efforts of Representatives to reach new customers, specially   designed sales aids, promotional pieces, customer flyers, television and print   advertising are used. In addition, Avon seeks to motivate its Representatives through   the use of special incentive programs that reward superior sales performance. Periodic   sales meetings with Representatives are conducted by the District Sales Managers.   The meetings are designed to keep Representatives abreast of product line changes,   explain sales techniques and provide recognition for sales performance.
3 A     number of merchandising techniques are used, including the introduction of new     products, the use of combination offers, the use of trial sizes and samples,     and the promotion of products packaged as gift items. In general for each sales     campaign, a distinctive brochure is published, in which new products are introduced     and selected items are offered at special prices or are given particular prominence     in the brochure.
Avon has furthered its image through increased advertising, introduction of the Health and Wellness business, creation of a corporate slogan the company for women, and the launching of mark. Avon has also increased its investments in upgrading the quality and size of its brochure in many markets to further strengthen the Companys beauty image worldwide.
From time to time, various regulations or laws have been proposed or adopted that would, in general, restrict the frequency, duration or volume of sales resulting from new product introductions, special prices or other special price offers. Avons pricing flexibility and broad product lines are expected to be able to mitigate the effect of these regulations.
Competitive Conditions The cosmetic, fragrance and toiletries (CFT), gift and decorative, apparel and fashion jewelry industries are highly competitive. Avons principal competitors in the CFT industry are large and well-known cosmetics and fragrances companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through various types of retail establishments. There are many other companies that compete in particular CFT products or product lines sold through retail establishments.
Avon has many competitors in the gift and decorative products and apparel industries in the United States, including retail establishments, principally department stores, gift shops and specialty retailers, and direct-mail companies specializing in these products.
Avons principal competition in the fashion jewelry industry consists of a few large companies and many small companies that sell fashion jewelry through retail establishments.
The number of competitors and degree of competition that Avon faces in its foreign CFT and fashion jewelry markets varies widely from country to country.
There are a number of direct-selling companies that sell product lines similar to Avons, some of which also have worldwide operations and compete with Avon.
Avon believes that the personalized customer service offered by its Representatives; the high quality, attractive designs and reasonable prices of its products; the high level of new and innovative products; its easily recognized brand name and its guarantee of satisfaction are significant factors in establishing and maintaining its competitive position.
International Operations Avons international operations are conducted primarily through subsidiaries in 59 countries or territories outside the U.S. and Avons products are distributed in some 72 other countries. The Company began operations in two new markets in 2003 (Bosnia and Kazakhstan).
Avons     international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in carrying on     business abroad, including, but not limited to, the risk of adverse currency     fluctuations, currency remittance restrictions and unfavorable social, economic and political conditions.
4 Manufacturing Avon manufactures and packages almost all of its CFT products. Raw materials, consisting chiefly of essential oils, chemicals, containers and packaging components, are purchased from various suppliers. Additionally, Avon produces the brochures that are used by the Representatives to sell Avon products. The loss of any one supplier would not have a material impact on Avons ability to source raw materials or paper for the brochures. Packages, consisting of containers and packaging components, are designed by its staff of artists and designers.
The design and development of new products are affected by the cost and availability of materials such as glass, plastics and chemicals. Avon believes that it can continue to obtain sufficient raw materials and supplies to manufacture and produce its products.
Avon had 17 manufacturing facilities around the world in 2003.	See Item 2, Properties, for additional information regarding the location of Avons manufacturing facilities.
In   2002, Avon closed a facility that manufactured fashion jewelry and now outsources   its full jewelry line from suppliers in Asia. In 2003, Avon closed a U.S. manufacturing   facility (in  Suffern, NY),  a manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom   and a distribution facility in Italy. Production was redeployed to other Avon sites   and third parties. Additionally, Avon is in the process of relocating a manufacturing   facility within  Mexico and plans to close a manufacturing facility in Canada in   2004. Production for the Canada market is in the process of being redeployed to   existing Avon facilities in the U.S. Lastly, construction commenced in 2003 on   a new manufacturing  facility in Russia, which will begin to serve growing demands   for the Companys Russian market in the second half of 2004.
Trademarks and Patents Avons business is not materially dependent on the existence of third party patent or other intellectual property rights and Avon is not a party to any ongoing material license, franchise or concession.
The Company, however, does seek to protect its key proprietary technologies by aggressively pursuing comprehensive patent coverage in major markets.
Avons major trademarks are protected by registration in the United States and other countries where its products are marketed.
Seasonal Nature Of Business Avons sales and earnings have a marked seasonal pattern characteristic of many companies selling CFT, gift and decorative products, apparel, and fashion jewelry. Holiday sales cause a sales peak in the fourth quarter of the year; however, the sales volume of holiday gift items is by its nature, difficult to forecast. Fourth quarter Net sales were approximately 30% of total Net sales in both 2003 and 2002, respectively, and fourth quarter Operating profit was approximately 35% of total Operating profit in both 2003 and 2002.
Research and Product Development Activities New     products are essential to growth in the highly competitive cosmetics industry.     Avons research and development departments efforts are significant     to developing new products, including formulating effective beauty treatments     relevant to women's needs, and redesigning or reformulating existing products.
5 Avons research and development facility is located in Suffern, NY. A team of researchers and technicians apply the disciplines of science to the practical aspects of bringing products to market around the world. Relationships with well known dermatologists and other specialists enhance Avons ability to deliver new formulas and ingredients to market.
In 2003, Avons most significant product launches included the following: Avon Solutions Cellu-Sculpt, an anti-cellulite treatment that treats cellulite by targeting firmness, dimpling, and texture; Lash Designer Mascara, a mascara that allows the user to create a variety of lash looks, featuring Building Block technology and the Clean Build patented brush; Skin-So-Soft Bug Guard Plus IR3535 eXpedition Insect Repellent, a DEET-free aerosol repellent, suitable for use for outdoor activities, that provides long-lasting repellency; Double Impact Lipcolor, a breakthrough in color performance lipcolor, designed with Avons exclusive Flexi-Smooth Technology; ANEW Clinical Line and Wrinkle Corrector, a skin treatment formulated with Derma-3X Technology that plumps and fills lines and wrinkles; and Treselle a fragrance featuring the exclusive Rose Gold Lifescent.
The amounts incurred on research activities relating to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products were $49.6 in 2003, $47.7 in 2002, and $45.9 in 2001. This research included the activities of product research and development and package design and development. Most of these activities are related to the development of CFT products.
Avon is increasing its investment in research and development by more than $100.0 over the period 2002 through 2005. A majority of the incremental investment is related to the construction of a research and development facility in Suffern, NY to replace the existing facility in that location. Construction of the facility began in 2003 and is expected to continue into 2005. Avon is funding the project with cash flows from operating activities.
Environmental Matters In general, compliance with environmental regulations impacting Avons global operations has not had, and is not anticipated to have, any material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, financial position or competitive position of Avon.
Employees At December 31, 2003, Avon employed approximately 45,900 full-time equivalents. Of these, approximately 9,400 were employed in the United States and 36,500 in other countries. The number of employees tends to rise from a low point in January to a high point in November and decreases slightly in December after holiday shipments are completed.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Avons   principal properties worldwide consist of 17 manufacturing facilities for the production   of CFT, 190 distribution centers where offices are located and where finished merchandise   is  packed and shipped to Representatives in fulfillment of their orders, and one   research and development facility. 38 of the facilities are owned and the remaining   170 properties are leased. Avon considers all of these properties to be in good   repair,  adequately meet Avons needs and operate at reasonable levels of   productive capacity.
The domestic manufacturing facilities are located in Morton Grove, IL; and Springdale, OH. The domestic distribution centers are located in Atlanta, GA; Glenview, IL; Newark, DE; and Pasadena, CA. The research and development facility is located in Suffern, NY. Other properties include three manufacturing facilities and 24 distribution centers in Europe; seven manufacturing facilities and 11 distribution centers in Latin America; one manufacturing facility and four distribution centers in North America (other than in the United States); and four manufacturing facilities and 147 distribution centers in the Pacific region.
Avon leases office space in New York City and owns property in Rye, NY for its executive and administrative offices. Avon also leases space in New York City for the Avon Centre.
Avon   also has 354 sales sites such as beauty boutiques, licensed satellite stores and   beauty centers around the world, primarily in Asia.
In   2002, Avon closed a facility that manufactured fashion jewelry and now outsources   its full jewelry line from suppliers in Asia. In 2003, Avon closed a U.S. manufacturing   facility (in Suffern, NY), a manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom   and a distribution facility in Italy. Production was redeployed to other Avon sites   and third parties. Additionally, Avon is in the process of relocating a manufacturing   facility within Mexico and plans to close a manufacturing facility in Canada   in 2004. Production for the Canada market is in the process of being redeployed   to existing Avon facilities in the U.S.
In   2003, Avon commenced construction on a   new research and development facility in Suffern, NY to replace the existing   facility in that location, and construction on a new  manufacturing facility   in Russia.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Avon is a defendant in a class action suit commenced in 1991 on behalf of certain classes of holders of Avons Preferred Equity-Redemption Cumulative Stock (PERCS).   Plaintiffs allege various contract and securities law claims related to the PERCS   (which were fully redeemed in 1991) and seek aggregate damages of approximately   $145.0, plus interest. A trial of this action took place in the United States District   Court for the Southern District of New York and concluded in November 2001. At   the conclusion of the trial, the judge reserved decision in the matter. Avon believes   it presented meritorious defenses to the claims asserted. However, it is not possible   to predict the outcome of litigation and it is reasonably possible that the trial,   and any possible appeal, could be decided unfavorably. Management is unable to   make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that 7 could result from an unfavorable   outcome but, under some of the damage theories presented, an adverse award could   be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Avon   is a defendant in an action commenced in the Supreme Court of the State of New   York by Sheldon Solow d/b/a Solow Building Company, the landlord of the Companys   former  headquarters in New York City.
Plaintiff seeks aggregate damages   of approximately $80.0, plus interest, for the Companys alleged failure to   restore the leasehold premises at the conclusion of the lease term in 1997. A trial   of this matter was  scheduled for February 2002, but was stayed pending the determination   of (i) an interlocutory appeal by plaintiff of an order that denied the plaintiffs   motion for summary judgment and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the   Company  on one of the plaintiffs claims; and (ii) an appeal by plaintiff   of a decision in an action against another former tenant that dismissed plaintiffs claims after trial. In January 2003, both appeals were decided against the plaintiff. Plaintiff filed motions for leave to appeal both decisions, which were denied. A trial has been scheduled to commence on May 24, 2004. In a separate action that has been pending since 1975, Solow alleges that Avon misappropriated the name of its former headquarters building and seeks damages based on a purported value of one   dollar per square foot of leased space over the term of the lease. Although this   action remained dormant for over twenty years, discovery in the matter has been   revived. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of litigation, management   believes that there are meritorious defenses to the claims asserted and that these   actions should not have a material adverse effect on the Consolidated Financial   Statements. These actions are being vigorously contested.
Avon Products Foundation, Inc. (the Avon Foundation) is a defendant in an arbitration proceeding brought by Pallotta TeamWorks (Pallotta) on September 3, 2002, before Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. Pallotta asserts claims of breach of contract, misappropriation of opportunity, tortious interference with prospective contractual arrangement and unfair competition arising out of the Avon Foundations decision to use another party to conduct breast cancer fundraising events, and seeks unspecified damages and attorneys fees. The arbitrator dismissed Pallottas misappropriation claim in January 2003, its unfair competition claim in February 2003 and its tortious interference claim in July 2003. A hearing on the remaining claim has been ongoing since July 2003. The Avon Foundation believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted by Pallotta and has filed a number of counterclaims. The Avon Foundation is a registered 501(c)(3) charity and is a distinct entity from Avon Products, Inc., which is not a party to these proceedings. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of litigation, management believes that these proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.
Blakemore, et al. v. Avon Products, Inc., et al. is a purported class action commenced in March 2003 in the Superior Court of the State of California on behalf of all persons in the United States who were or are Independent Sales Representatives (ISRs) for Avon from 1999 to the date of judgment who were shipped product by Avon that the ISR did not order, who were charged for such product and who were not credited for such charges. The initial complaint demanded unspecified damages and equitable, injunctive and/or declaratory relief for alleged violations of the California Business and Professions Code, breach of contract, unjust enrichment and money had and received. The Company filed a demurrer to the complaint, asserting that it failed to state a cause of action. In December 2003 the court sustained the Companys demurrer based on the initial plaintiffs failure to allege actual damages, but gave the plaintiff time to amend her complaint and produce a plaintiff who had actually suffered 8 damages. On January 23, 2004,   plaintiff Blakemore and three other plaintiffs served an amended class action complaint   on behalf of Avon Sales Representatives who received products from Avon they did not order, thereafter returned the unordered products to Avon, and did not receive credit for those returned products. The amended complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, restitution and injunctive relief for alleged fraudulent concealment, breach of contract, unjust enrichment and violation of the California Business and Professions Code. The Company believes that this action is a dispute over purported customer service issues and is an inappropriate subject for consideration as a class action. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of litigation, management believes that there are meritorious defenses to the claims asserted and that this action should not have a material adverse effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. This action is being vigorously contested.
On December 20, 2002, a Brazilian subsidiary of the Company received a series of excise and income tax assessments from the Brazilian tax authorities asserting that the establishment in 1995 of separate manufacturing and distribution companies in that country was done without a valid business purpose. The assessments assert tax deficiencies during portions of the years 1997 and 1998 of approximately $71.0 at the exchange rate on the date of this filing, plus penalties and accruing interest totaling approximately $121.0 at the exchange rate on the date of this filing. On July 1, 2003, the Brazilian subsidiary of the Company was informed that the first-level appellate body had rejected the basis for income tax assessments representing approximately 78% of the total assessment, or $150.0 (including interest), but that rejection is subject to mandatory second-level appellate review. The balance of the assessment relating to excise taxes (approximately $42.0) was not affected. On December 26, 2003 an additional assessment was received in respect of excise taxes for the balance of 1998, totaling approximately $76.0 at the exchange rate on the date of this filing and asserting a different theory of liability based on purported market sales data. In the event that the assessments are upheld or reinstated in the earlier stages of review, it may be necessary for the Company to provide security to pursue further appeals, which, depending on the circumstances, may result in a charge to income. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of expense that could result from an unfavorable outcome in respect of these or any additional assessments that may be issued for subsequent periods. The structure adopted in 1995 is comparable to that used by many companies in Brazil, and the Company believes that it is appropriate, both operationally and legally, and that the assessments are unfounded. This matter is being vigorously contested and in the opinion of the Companys outside counsel the likelihood that the assessments ultimately will be upheld is remote. Management believes that the likelihood that the assessments will have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements is also remote.
Polish   subsidiaries of the Company have been responding to Protocols of Inspection served   by the Polish tax authorities in respect of 1999 and 2000 tax audits. The Protocols   asserted tax deficiencies, penalties and accruing interest totaling approximately   $30.0 at the exchange rate on the date of this filing: $16.5 primarily relating   to the documentation of certain sales, and $13.5 related to excise taxes. On July   29, 2003, the Company accepted a final assessment of approximately $0.6 in respect   of the excise tax matter, and on December 29, 2003 the Company accepted a final assessment of approximately $0.5 in respect of the documentation of sales matter.
Various     other lawsuits and claims, arising in the ordinary course of business or related     to businesses previously sold, are pending or threatened against Avon. In the     opinion of Avons management, based on its review of the information available     at this time, the total cost of 9 resolving such other contingencies at December 31, 2003, should not have a material adverse effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
