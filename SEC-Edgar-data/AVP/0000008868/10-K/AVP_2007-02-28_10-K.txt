PART I  Dollars in Millions  ITEM 1. BUSINESS  General        Avon commenced operations in 1886 and was incorporated in the State of New York on January 27, 1916.  Avon is a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products. Avon's products fall into three product categories: "Beauty" which consists of cosmetics, fragrance and toiletries ("CFT"); "Beauty Plus" which consists of jewelry, watches and apparel and accessories; and "Beyond Beauty" which consists of home products, gift and decorative and candles. In 2001, Avon                                          -1- launched an entirely new global product category in the area of women's health and wellness.  This new line expands the definition of beauty to include inner health, as well as outward appearance.  The new products are sold through a separate catalog and include vitamins and nutrition supplements, exercise and fitness items, and a variety of self-care and stress relief products.  Vitamins and nutritional supplements have been developed for Avon by Roche Consumer Healthcare and are marketed under the name VitAdvance.  Health and Wellness products are divided among all three product categories based on product segmentation. Additionally, in 2001, Avon launched a retail line in the U.S. to sell a new line of Avon products called "beComing" in selected stores of a major retailer, J.C. Penney Company, Inc. ("J.C. Penney").  The new line offers beauty products, as well as a selection of jewelry and accessories and health and wellness products.  The "beComing" line is priced significantly higher than the core Avon line, but well below prestige brands.  This retail arrangement leverages Avon's product development and manufacturing capabilities with the retail expertise of J.C. Penney.  The retail strategy is intended to enable Avon to access new customers that Avon is not currently reaching through the direct selling channel.  In 2003, Avon plans to launch a new global business targeted to teenage girls to win market share in the worldwide youth market.        Avon's business primarily is comprised of one industry segment, direct selling, which is conducted in North America, Latin America, the Pacific and Europe.  The Company's reportable segments are based on geographic operations.  Financial information relating to the reportable segments is incorporated by reference to the analysis of Net sales and Operating profit by geographic area, and to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on pages 24 and 56 through 57, respectively, in Avon's 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Distribution       Avon presently has operations in 58 countries, including the United States, and its products are distributed in 85 more for coverage in 143 markets.  Sales are made to the ultimate customer principally through a combination of direct selling and marketing by approximately 3.5 million independent Avon Representatives, approximately 451,000 of whom are in the United States. Representatives are independent contractors or independent dealers, and are not agents or employees of Avon. Representatives purchase products directly from Avon and sell them to their customers.  No single customer accounts for more than 10% of Avon's net sales.                                           -2- A Representative contacts customers, selling primarily through the use of brochures which also highlight new products and specially-priced items for each sales campaign. Sales campaigns are generally for a two- week duration in the United States and a three to four week duration outside the United States.  Product samples, demonstration products and selling aids such as make-up color charts are also used. Generally, the Representative forwards an order to a designated distribution center. A Representative can place an order 24 hours a day, 7 days a week using the mail, telephone, fax or the Internet.  This order is processed and the products are assembled at the distribution center and delivered to the Representative's home, usually by a local delivery service. The Representative then delivers the merchandise and collects payment from the customer for his or her own account.       Avon employs certain electronic order systems to increase Representative support, which allows the Representatives to run their businesses more efficiently as well as to improve order processing accuracy. Additionally, Avon Representatives can utilize the Internet to manage their business electronically.  In the U.S., Avon Representatives use a new online marketing tool called youravon.com, which was introduced in 2000. The site features a complete line of Avon's products 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with no geographic boundaries.  The site helps Representatives build their own Avon business by enabling them to sell online through their own personalized web pages, developed in partnership with Avon.  Additionally, these e-Representatives have the advantage of business-to-business capabilities that connect them to Avon's order and fulfillment systems.  While their customers benefit from the speed, convenience and delivery flexibility of online ordering, Avon e- Representatives are able to promote special products, target specific groups of customers, place and track orders online, and capitalize on e- mail to share product information, selling tips and marketing incentives. Self-paced online training also is available, as well as up-to-the-minute news about Avon.  Globally, Avon has internet sites in more than 20 markets.  Most are consumer information sites, but in 2001, the U.K., Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Hungary also piloted business-to-business sites to support Representatives.  In the United States, Avon also sells its products to the ultimate customer through licensed kiosks located in shopping malls across the U.S and on Avon's internet site if the customer chooses not to purchase through a Representative. Avon also sells products at the Avon Centre, a spa, salon and retail store located in Trump Tower, New York City.  The Avon Centre emphasizes health and beauty and offers a selection of Avon beauty products created exclusively for use at the Avon Centre.  As previously discussed, in 2001, Avon opened Avon Centers in selected stores of J.C. Penney to sell a new line of Avon products.                              -3- Primarily in the Asia Pacific region, Avon uses decentralized branches and satellite stores to serve Representatives and customers. Representatives come to a branch near their homes to place and pick up product orders for their customers.  The branches also create visibility for Avon with consumers and help reinforce the Company's beauty image. In markets such as China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Venezuela, Representatives can manage Avon beauty boutiques, beauty counters, licensed Avon beauty centers and other retail-oriented opportunities to build their careers and bring Avon to new customers in complementary ways to direct selling.       The recruiting and training of Representatives are the primary responsibilities of District Sales Managers. District Sales Managers are employees of Avon and are paid a salary and a sales incentive based primarily on the increase over the prior year's sales of Avon products by Representatives in their district.  Personal contacts, including recommendations from current Representatives (including the Sales Leadership program), and local advertising constitute the primary means of obtaining new Representatives. The Sales Leadership program is a modified multi-level selling system which gives Representatives the opportunity to earn commissions on their own sales, as well as from downstream sales of Representatives they recruit.  This program limits the number of levels to three and continues to focus on individual product sales.  The Sales Leadership program is active in 24 countries, including the U.S., Poland and Hungary.  Ten additional markets are scheduled to launch this program in 2002.  Because of the high rate of turnover among Representatives, a characteristic of the direct-selling method, recruiting and training of new Representatives are continually necessary.  Avon also has a Representative development strategy in the U.S. that focuses on the professional training and development of Representatives through the Avon Beauty Advisor program.  Under this program, Representatives enroll in a series of courses designed to enhance their product knowledge and professional beauty consulting skills.       From time to time, the question of the legal status of Representatives has arisen, usually in regard to possible coverage under social benefit laws that would require Avon (and in most instances, the Representatives) to make regular contributions to social benefit funds. Although Avon has generally been able to address these questions in a satisfactory manner, the matter has not been fully resolved in all                                        -4- countries. If there should be a final determination adverse to Avon in a country, the cost for future, and possibly past, contributions could be so substantial in the context of the volume of business of Avon in that country that it would have to consider discontinuing operations in that country.  Promotion and Marketing       Sales promotion and sales development activities are directed at assisting the Representatives, through sales aids such as brochures, product samples and demonstration products. In order to support the efforts of Representatives to reach new customers, especially working women and other individuals who frequently are not at home, specially designed sales aids, promotional pieces, customer flyers and other advertising are used. In addition, Avon seeks to motivate its Representatives through the use of special incentive programs that reward superior sales performance. Periodic sales meetings with Representatives are conducted by the District Sales Managers. The meetings are designed to keep Representatives abreast of product line changes, explain sales techniques and provide recognition for sales performance.       A number of merchandising techniques, including the introduction of new products, the use of combination offers, the use of trial sizes and the promotion of products packaged as gift items, are used. In general for each sales campaign, a distinctive brochure is published, in which new products are introduced and selected items are offered at special prices or are given particular prominence in the brochure. CFT products are available each sales campaign at consistently low prices, while introductory specials and periodic sales are maintained on selected items for limited time periods.        Avon is marketing a more vibrant beauty image through increased advertising and image-building programs focused on the consumer.  In 2000, Avon launched its first-ever global advertising campaign entitled "Let's Talk", increased investments in product sampling and development and upgraded the quality of its brochure to further strengthen its worldwide beauty image.  In 2001, "Let's Talk" advertising campaigns included the Williams sisters, accomplished young sports professionals who, through their embodiment of Avon's values of empowerment and self- fulfillment, serve as role models for women everywhere.       From time to time, various regulations or laws have been proposed or adopted that would, in general, restrict the frequency, duration or                                         -5- volume of sales resulting from new product introductions, special prices or other special price offers.  Avon's pricing flexibility and broad product lines are expected to be able to mitigate the effect of these regulations.  Competitive Conditions       The CFT; gift and decorative; apparel; and fashion jewelry and accessory industries are highly competitive. Avon is one of the leading manufacturers and distributors of cosmetics and fragrances in the United States. Its principal competitors are the large and well-known cosmetics and fragrances companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through various types of retail establishments. There are many other companies that compete in particular products or product lines sold through retail establishments.       Avon has many competitors in the gift and decorative products and apparel industries in the United States, including retail establishments, principally department stores, gift shops, specialty retailers and direct-mail companies, specializing in these products.       Avon is one of the leading distributors of fashion jewelry and accessories for women in the United States. Its principal competition in the fashion jewelry industry consists of a few large companies and many small companies that manufacture and sell fashion jewelry for women through retail establishments.       The number of competitors and degree of competition that Avon faces in its foreign CFT and fashion jewelry markets varies widely from country to country. Avon is one of the leading manufacturers and distributors in the CFT industry in most of its foreign markets, as well as in the fashion jewelry industry in Europe.       There are a number of direct-selling companies which sell product lines similar to Avon's, some of which also have worldwide operations and compete with Avon.       Avon believes that the personalized customer service offered by its Representatives; the high quality, attractive designs and reasonable prices of its products; new product introductions; innovative CFT products; and its guarantee of satisfaction are significant factors in establishing and maintaining its competitive position.                                           -6- International Operations       Avon's international operations are conducted primarily through subsidiaries in 57 countries and Avon's products are distributed in some 85 other countries.  The Company has entered 30 new markets since 1990, including Russia and China and rapidly emerging nations throughout Central Europe, and is currently evaluating several other markets in Eastern Europe and the Pacific region.       Avon's international operations are subject to certain customary risks inherent in carrying on business abroad, including the risk of adverse currency fluctuations, currency remittance restrictions and unfavorable economic and political conditions.  Manufacturing       Avon manufactures and packages almost all of its CFT products. Raw materials, consisting chiefly of essential oils, chemicals, containers and packaging components, are purchased from various suppliers. Packages, consisting of containers and packaging components, are designed by its staff of artists and designers.       The design and development of new products are affected by the cost and availability of materials such as glass, plastics and chemicals. Avon believes that it can continue to obtain sufficient raw materials and supplies to manufacture and produce its products.       Avon has 18 manufacturing laboratories around the world, one of which is principally devoted to the manufacture of fashion jewelry. In the first quarter of 2002, the laboratory that manufactures fashion jewelry will be closed.  Avon will outsource jewelry manufacturing and purchase its full jewelry line from suppliers in Asia.  In the United States, Avon's CFT products are produced in three manufacturing laboratories.  Most products sold in foreign countries are manufactured in Avon's facilities abroad.  Trademarks and Patents       Avon's business is not materially dependent on the existence of third party patent or other intellectual property rights and Avon is not a party to any ongoing material license, franchise or concession.                                        -7- The Company, however, does seek to protect its key proprietary technologies by aggressively pursuing comprehensive patent coverage in all major markets.       Avon's major trademarks are protected by registration in the United States and the other countries where its products are marketed as well as in many other countries throughout the world.  Seasonal Nature Of Business       Avon's sales and earnings have a marked seasonal pattern characteristic of many companies selling CFT; gift and decorative products; apparel; and fashion jewelry. Holiday sales cause a sales peak in the fourth quarter of the year. Fourth quarter net sales were approximately 30 percent of total net sales in both 2001 and 2000, respectively, and before special and non-recurring charges, fourth quarter operating profit was 34 percent and 33 percent of total operating profit in 2001 and 2000, respectively.  Research Activities       Avon's research and development department is a leader in the industry, based on the number of new product launches, including formulating effective beauty treatments relevant to women's needs.       A team of researchers and technicians apply the disciplines of science to the practical aspects of bringing products to market around the world. Relationships with well known dermatologists and other specialists enhance Avon's ability to deliver new formulas and ingredients to market.       Avon has pioneered many innovative products, including Skin-So-Soft, BioAdvance, the first skin care product with stabilized retinol, and Collagen Booster, a product that capitalizes on Vitamin C technology. Avon also introduced the benefits of aromatherapy to millions of American women, encapsulated color for the Color-Release line and introduced alpha-hydroxy acid for cosmetic use in the Anew Perfecting Complex products.  Avon's Anew product line has been expanded to include technologically advanced products such as Retroactive, Retinol Recovery Complex PM Treatment, Night Force Vertical Lifting Complex, Clearly C 10% Vitamin C Serum and Luminosity Brightening Complex.  Retroactive utilizes Avon's exclusive Rejuvi-cell complex, a blend of ingredients formulated to enhance cellular communication and re-energize aging skin cells.                                        -8- Night Force employs a patented material named AVC10, a molecule that was engineered by Avon researchers over a three-year period.  Luminosity Brightening Complex contains Diamonex, Avon's exclusive skin brightening system.  Avon has introduced Hydra Finish Lip Color, the first lipstick developed with 20% water, and Perceive, a fragrance which uses the mood- enhancing effects of pheromone technology.  In 2001, Avon updated packaging for the Anew line and Anew Retroactive, launched Pure 02, a facial lotion that increases oxygen delivery to skin cells and erases signs of stress and fatigue; Avon Beyond Color Illuminating Radiance Vitamin C Foundation; Avon Beyond Color Nutralush Plumping Lipstick and a new fragrance called Little Black Dress.  In 2000, the Company launched a complete renovation of Avon Color with improved formulas and redesigned packaging, rolled out a reformulated Anew All-In-One skin care regimen, launched Positivity, a new line of skin care products for menopausal women, and launched Advance Techniques, a full line of upscale patent- pending hair-care products.       The amounts incurred on research activities relating to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products were $45.9 in 2001, $43.1 in 2000, and $38.2 in 1999. This research included the activities of product research and development and package design and development. Most of these activities are related to the development of CFT products.  Environmental Matters       Pursuant to Avon's global environmental policy, environmental audits are conducted to ensure Avon facilities around the world meet or exceed local regulatory standards.  A corporate environmental operations committee ensures that opportunities for environmental performance improvements are reflected in our products, packaging and manufacturing processes.       In general, compliance with environmental regulations impacting Avon's global operations has not had, and is not anticipated to have, any material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, financial position or competitive position of Avon.  Employees       At December 31, 2001, Avon employed 43,800 people. Of these, 9,600 were employed in the United States and 34,200 in other countries. The number of employees tends to rise from a low point in January to a high point in November and decreases slightly in December after holiday shipments are completed.                                          -9- ITEM 2. PROPERTIES       Avon's principal properties consist of manufacturing laboratories for the production of CFT and distribution centers where offices are located and where finished merchandise is warehoused and shipped to Representatives in fulfillment of their orders. Substantially all of these properties are owned by Avon or its subsidiaries, are in good repair, adequately meet Avon's needs and operate at reasonable levels of productive capacity.       The domestic manufacturing laboratories are located in Morton Grove, IL; Springdale, OH; and Suffern, NY. The distribution centers are located in Atlanta, GA; Glenview, IL; Newark, DE; and Pasadena, CA.  Other properties include three manufacturing laboratories and eleven distribution centers in Europe; six manufacturing laboratories and nine distribution centers in Latin America; two manufacturing laboratories and two distribution centers in North America (other than in the United States); and four manufacturing laboratories and nine distribution centers in the Pacific region.  The research and development laboratories are located in Suffern, NY. Avon leases space for its executive and administrative offices in New York City and its fashion jewelry manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico.  The jewelry manufacturing facility will be closed by March 2002.       Avon also has Avon beauty boutiques, licensed satellite stores and Avon beauty centers in 32 countries.  ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings       Avon is a defendant in a class action suit commenced in 1991 on behalf of certain classes of holders of Avon's Preferred Equity- Redemption Cumulative Stock ("PERCS").  Plaintiffs allege various contract and securities law claims related to the PERCS (which were fully redeemed in 1991) and seek aggregate damages of approximately $145.0, plus interest.  A trial of this action took place in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and concluded in November 2001.  At the conclusion of the trial, the judge reserved decision in the matter.  Avon believes it presented meritorious defenses to the claims asserted.  However, it is not possible to predict the outcome of litigation and it is reasonably possible that the trial, and any possible appeal, could be decided unfavorably.  Management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome but, under some of the damage theories presented, an adverse award could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Avon is a defendant in an action commenced in 1997 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by Sheldon Solow d/b/a Solow Building Company, the landlord of the Company's former headquarters in New York                                      -10- City.  Plaintiff seeks aggregate damages of approximately $80.0, plus interest, for the Company's alleged failure to restore the leasehold premises at the conclusion of the lease term in 1997.  A trial of this matter had been scheduled for February 2002, but has been stayed pending the determination of (i)  an interlocutory appeal by plaintiff of an order that denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Company on one of plaintiff's claims; and (ii) an appeal by plaintiff of a decision in an action against another former tenant that dismissed plaintiff's claims after trial.  While it is not possible to predict the outcome of litigation, management believes that there are meritorious defenses to the claims asserted and that this action should not have a material adverse effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  This action is being vigorously contested.       Various other lawsuits and claims (asserted and unasserted), arising in the ordinary course of business or related to businesses previously sold, are pending or threatened against Avon.  In the opinion of Avon's management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving such other contingencies at December 31, 2001 should not have a material adverse impact on Avon's Consolidated Financial Statements.       In 1998, the Argentine tax authorities denied certain past excise tax credits taken by Avon's subsidiary in Argentina and assessed this subsidiary for the corresponding taxes.  Avon vigorously contested this assessment through local administrative and judicial proceedings since 1998.  In the third quarter of 2001, the Argentine government issued a decree permitting taxpayers to satisfy certain tax liabilities on favorable terms using Argentine government bonds as payment.  Avon decided to settle this contested tax assessment by applying for relief under this new government program and purchased bonds to tender in settlement of the aforementioned assessment.  As a result, a pre-tax charge of $6.4 ($3.4 after-tax, or $.01 per diluted share) was included in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the third quarter of 2001.       Avon has been responding to a formal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") which commenced in August 2000, and has furnished to the SEC information that principally concerns a special charge reported by Avon in the first quarter of 1999, which included the write-off of approximately $15.0 in pre-tax costs associated with an order management software system known as the FIRST project.  The balance of the FIRST project's development costs had been carried as an asset until the third quarter of 2001, when Avon recorded a pre-tax charge of $23.9 ($14.5 after-tax, or $.06 per diluted share) to write off the carrying value of costs related to that project.  As part of a resolution of the investigation or at the conclusion of a contested proceeding, there may be a finding that Avon knew or should have known in the first quarter of 1999 that it was not probable that FIRST would be implemented                                      -11- and therefore, the entire FIRST asset should have been written off as abandoned at that time.  In that connection, it may also be necessary for Avon to restate its financial statements to write off the entire FIRST asset in the first quarter of 1999.  If Avon were to restate its financial statements to write off the FIRST asset in the first quarter of 1999, then the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001 and other FIRST-related items recorded in prior periods would also be restated.
