ii Table of Contents PART I ITEM1.BUSINESS Overview We are a leading wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure company with a portfolio of over 22,000 owned communications sites. Our portfolio includes approximately 20,000 owned tower sites in the United States and over 2,500 in Mexico and Brazil. In addition to our owned tower sites, we offer access to over 10,000 rooftop and tower sites in the United States that we manage for third parties. We also operate in-building distributed antenna systems in malls and casino/hotel resorts. Our primary business is leasing antenna space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies. We operate the largest independent portfolio of wireless and broadcast communications sites in the United States, Mexico and Brazil, based on number of sites and revenue.
Our communications site portfolio provides us with a recurring base of leasing revenues from our existing customers and growth potential due to the capacity to add more tenants and equipment to these sites. Our broad network of communications sites enables us to address the needs of national, regional, local and emerging wireless service providers. We also offer limited services that directly support our site leasing operations and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. We intend to capitalize on the continuing increase in the use of wireless communications services by actively marketing space available for leasing on our existing sites and selectively developing or acquiring new sites that meet our return on investment criteria.
Our site leasing business, which we also refer to as our rental and management segment, accounted for approximately 99.5% and 99.3% of our segment operating profit for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006, we expect that our rental and management segment will continue to contribute approximately 99% of our segment operating profit, which we define as segment revenue less direct segment expense (rental and management segment operating profit includes interest income, TV Azteca, net).
Over the last three years, we have focused our operations on our rental and management segment by selling numerous non-core assets and businesses and using the proceeds from these sales to purchase high quality tower assets and reduce our outstanding indebtedness. With the sale of our tower construction services unit in November 2004, we substantially completed our strategic transition to a focused site leasing company.
In August 2005, we expanded our communications site portfolio and our rental and management operations through our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., an owner and operator of approximately 7,800 wireless and broadcast towers and in-building systems in the United States. We believe the merger provided us with significant strategic and financial advantages. We believe our larger scale will translate into increased cooperation with our customers, and create greater flexibility to structure mutually beneficial contracts, potentially resulting in further increases in revenue and market share. We also believe the merger will enable us to maximize our return on investment by creating a significantly larger revenue base over which to spread our relatively fixed overhead costs, therefore further capitalizing on the significant operating leverage inherent in the tower business model. For more information about our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
We believe our strategy of focusing operations on our rental and management segment has made our consolidated operating cash flows more stable, will provide us with continuing growth and will enhance our returns on invested capital because of the following characteristics of our core leasing business:  Long-term tenant leases with contractual escalators.
In general, a lease with a wireless carrier has an initial term of five-to-ten years with multiple five-year renewal terms thereafter, and lease payments typically increase 3% to 5%per year.
Operating expenses are largely fixed.
Incremental operating costs associated with adding wireless tenants to a communications site are minimal. Therefore, as additional tenants are added to a site, the substantial majority of incremental revenue becomes operating profit.
Low maintenance capital expenditures.
On average, a communications site requires low annual capital investments to maintain.
1 Table of Contents  High lease renewal rates.
Wireless carriers tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in a carriers network is expensive and may adversely affect network quality.
Strategy Our strategy is to capitalize on the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and the infrastructure requirements necessary to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies.
In the United States, the number of wireless service subscribers increased from 128.4million to 194.5million between December 2001 and June 2005, representing an increase of approximately 51% and market penetration of approximately 65%. During the same period, the number of cell sites (i.e., the number of antennas and related equipment in commercial operation, not the number of towers on which that equipment is located) increased approximately 40% from approximately 127,500 cell sites to approximately 178,000. In addition, wireless minutes of use, an indicator of demand for wireless services, exceeded one trillion in the United States for 2004, an increase of over 32% from the prior year, and the industry is on pace to report strong growth for 2005.
In Mexico, the number of wireless service subscribers increased from 21.8million to 44.6million between December 2001 and September 2005, representing an increase of approximately 105% and market penetration of approximately 42%. In Brazil, the number of wireless service subscribers increased from 28.7million to 86.2million between December 2001 and December 2005, representing an increase of approximately 200% and market penetration of approximately 47%.
We believe the continuing growth in the number of wireless service subscribers and the minutes of use per subscriber will require wireless carriers to add new cell sites, and new equipment to existing cell sites, to maintain the performance of their networks in the areas they currently cover and to extend service to areas where coverage does not yet exist. As wireless carriers continue to add subscribers and seek to limit churn, we also anticipate they will focus on network quality as a competitive necessity and will invest in upgrades to their networks. In addition, we believe that as wireless data services, such as email, internet access and video, are deployed on a widespread basis, the deployment of these technologies may require wireless carriers to further increase the cell density of their existing networks, may require new technology and equipment, and may increase the demand for geographic expansion of their network coverage. To meet this demand, we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means of accelerating access to their markets and preserving capital, rather than constructing and operating their own communications sites and maintaining their own communications sites service and development capabilities.
We believe that our existing portfolio of communications sites, our tower-related services offerings and our management team position us to benefit from these trends and to play an increasing role in addressing the needs of wireless service providers and broadcasters. The key elements of our strategy include:  Maximize Use of Existing Site Capacity.
We believe that our highest returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. We anticipate that our revenues and segment operating profit will continue to grow because many of our communications sites are attractively located for wireless service providers and have capacity available for additional antenna space that we can offer to customers at low incremental costs to us. Because the costs of operating a site are largely fixed, increasing utilization significantly improves operating margins. We will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase utilization of, and investment return on, our existing communications sites.
Grow Our Site Portfolio Using Selective Criteria for Acquisitions and New Development.
Given the relatively fixed cost structure of our site leasing business, we believe that adding new communications sites to our portfolio will allow us to grow revenues with only modest increases in 2 Table of Contents administrative operating expenses. We seek to acquire, construct and redevelop towers and install in-building systems when our initial and long-term return on investment criteria are met. We similarly evaluate expansion opportunities into new markets. To achieve our expected returns for a new site, we typically secure leases from customers in advance of construction or installation, ensure reasonable estimated construction or installation costs and, for new tower sites, obtain the land on which to build the tower, whether by purchase or ground lease, on reasonable terms.
Continue Our Focus on Customer Service and Processes.
Because speed to market and reliable network performance are critical components to the success of wireless service providers, our ability to assist customers in meeting their goals will contribute to our success. We intend to continue to focus on customer service by, for example, reducing cycle times for key functions, such as lease processing. In addition, our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. provided us with an opportunity to adopt best practices from both companies in an effort to further improve the efficiency of our processes. We believe our efforts should enable us to increase revenue generation through improved speed, accuracy and quality. In addition, sharing operational processes and outcomes establishes another connection point with our customers and provides us valuable input and relationship enhancing opportunities.
Build On Our Strong Customer Relationships.
Our understanding of the network needs of our customers and our ability to convey effectively how we can satisfy those needs are key to our efforts to add new antenna leases, cross-sell our services and identify desirable new site development projects. We are building on our strong relationships with our major wireless carrier customers to gain more familiarity with their evolving network plans so we can identify opportunities where our nationwide portfolio of sites and experienced personnel can be used to satisfy their needs. We are also working with smaller and emerging wireless carriers and network operators as they define their coverage and network needs and expand into new markets. We believe we are well positioned to be a preferred partner to our customers because of the scope and location of our portfolio of communications sites, our proven operating experience and our scale relative to our competitors.
Participate in Industry Consolidation.
We continue to believe there are benefits to consolidation among tower companies. More extensive networks will be better positioned to provide more comprehensive service to customers and to support the infrastructure requirements of future generations of wireless communications technologies. We believe that our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. will result in improvements in cost structure efficiencies, with a corresponding positive impact on our operating results, and that combining with one or more other tower companies should yield similar results. Accordingly, we continue to be interested in participating in the consolidation of our industry on terms that are consistent with these perceived benefits and that create long-term value for our stockholders.
The Company American Tower Corporation was created as a subsidiary of American Radio Systems Corporation in 1995 to own, manage, develop and lease communications and broadcast tower sites, and was spun off into a free-standing public company in 1998. Over the last ten years, we have grown our communications site portfolio through tower acquisitions, tower development and construction, and through mergers with and acquisitions of other tower operators, increasing the size of our communications site portfolio to over 22,000 owned sites.
American Tower Corporation is a holding company, and we conduct our operations in the United States, Mexico and Brazil through operating subsidiaries. Our principal United States operating subsidiaries are American Towers, Inc. (ATI) and SpectraSite Communications, Inc. (SpectraSite). Our principal international operating subsidiary is American Tower International, Inc., which conducts operations in Mexico through its subsidiary ATC Mexico Holding Corp. (ATC Mexico) and in Brazil through its subsidiary ATC South America Holding Corp. (ATC South America).
We operate in two business segments: rental and management and network development services. For more information about our business segments, as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which 3 Table of Contents we operate, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the section entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Prior to December 2002, we also had a satellite and fiber network access services segment, which consisted of our Verestar, Inc., subsidiary (Verestar). In December 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of this business, and in December 2003, Verestar and its affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. Accordingly, we have accounted for Verestar as a discontinued operation through the date of the bankruptcy filing and we ceased to consolidate Verestars financial results as of that date. See Item1A of this annual report under the caption Risk FactorsThe bankruptcy proceeding of our Verestar subsidiary exposes us to risks and uncertainties and notes 3 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
Products and Services Rental and Management We conduct our site leasing business through our rental and management segment. Our primary business is leasing antenna space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies. Our communications site portfolio includes approximately 20,000 owned tower sites in the United States and over 2,500 in Mexico and Brazil. In addition to our owned tower sites, we offer access to over 10,000 rooftop and tower sites in the United States that we manage for third parties. Through our rental and management segment, we also operate in-building distributed antenna systems in malls and casino/hotel resorts.
Wireless Communications Towers.
We own and operate the largest independent portfolio of wireless communications towers in the United States, Mexico and Brazil, based on number of towers and revenue. Our network in the United States includes approximately 19,300 owned wireless communications towers and spans 49 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, 85% of our U.S. network provides coverage in the top 100 markets or core areas such as high traffic interstate corridors. Our Mexican network includes approximately 1,800 owned wireless communications towers in highly populated areas, including Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara and Acapulco. Our Brazilian network consists of approximately 500 owned wireless communications towers, which are concentrated in southern Brazil in major metropolitan areas, including Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia and Curitiba. In addition, we market and manage approximately 1,700 wireless tower sites for third parties including approximately 600 sites in the United States, 400 in Mexico and 700 in Brazil. Approximately 400 of the 1,700 wireless tower sites that we manage for third parties were revenue-producing as of December31, 2005.
We lease antenna space on our wireless communications towers to customers in a diverse range of wireless industries, including personal communications services, cellular, enhanced specialized mobile radio, paging and fixed microwave. Our major domestic wireless customers include ALLTEL, Cingular Wireless, Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile USA and Verizon Wireless. Our major international wireless customers include Iusacell Celular, Nextel Mexico, Telefonica Moviles and Unefon in Mexico, and Nextel Brazil, Telecom Americas and Telecom Italia Mobile in Brazil. For the year ended December31, 2005, assuming our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. occurred on January1, 2005, we had three customers that each accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues. Cingular Wireless accounted for approximately 19% of our 2005 total revenues, Sprint Nextel (assuming the merger of Sprint PCS and Nextel occurred on January1, 2005) accounted for approximately 17% (approximately 22% including Sprint Nextel partners and affiliates) and Verizon Wireless accounted for approximately 10%. Approximately 59% of our total revenues for the year ended December31, 2005 were derived from five customers. See Item1A of this annual report under the caption Risk FactorsA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers and Due to the long-term expectations of revenue from tenant leases, the tower industry is sensitive to the credit worthiness of its tenants.
The number of antennas that our towers can accommodate varies depending on the towers location, height, and the structural capacity at certain wind speeds. An antennas height on a tower and the towers location 4 Table of Contents determine the line-of-sight of the antenna with the horizon and, coupled with the specific band of radio frequency and technology used by the carrier, determine the distance a signal can be transmitted. Some of our customers, such as personal communications services, enhanced specialized mobile radio providers and cellular companies in metropolitan areas, typically do not place their equipment at the highest tower point. Other customers, including paging companies and specialized mobile radio providers in rural areas, prefer higher elevations for broader coverage. We believe that a significant majority of our towers have the capacity to add additional tenants.
Our leases with wireless communications providers in the United States generally have initial terms of five-to-ten years. In Mexico and Brazil, our typical tenant lease has an initial term of ten years. In most cases, our tenant leases have multiple renewal terms at the option of the tenant. Wireless carriers generally renew their leases with us because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in an existing carriers network is expensive and often requires reconfiguring several other sites in the carriers network, which may impact the quality of the carriers coverage and may require the carrier to obtain other governmental permits. Most of our tenant leases have escalation provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These automatic increases are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage, inflation or a fixed percentage plus inflation.
Annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon:  tower location;  number and weight of antennas on the tower and the size of the transmission lines;  ground space necessary to store equipment related to the antennas;  existing tower capacity;  placement of the customers antennas on the tower; and  type and amount of frequency transmitted by the customer.
Broadcast Communications Towers.
We are one of the largest independent owners and operators of broadcast towers in the United States and Mexico. We own approximately 220 broadcast towers in the United States and have exclusive rights to approximately 190 in Mexico. Broadcast towers generally are taller and structurally more complex than wireless communications towers, require unique engineering skills and are more costly to build. We lease antenna space on our broadcast towers primarily to radio and television broadcast companies. In leasing antenna space, we generally receive monthly fees from customers, with initial lease periods ranging from ten-to-twenty years.
In-Building Neutral Host Distributed Antenna Systems.
As a result of our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., we are now a leading provider in the United States of in-building neutral host distributed antenna systems. We have approximately 100 in-building systems in operation in retail shopping malls and casino/hotel resorts, and we have the exclusive rights to an additional 200 properties in the United States. We obtain rights to install and operate in-building systems by entering into leases with property owners, which are generally for an initial non-cancelable period of ten years. Some of these leases contain automatic extension provisions and continue after the initial period unless terminated by us. Under these leases, we are the exclusive operator of in-building neutral host distributed antenna systems for the term of the lease. We are also responsible for marketing the property as part of our portfolio of communications sites and for installing, operating and maintaining the distributed antenna system at the properties. We grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our in-building system for a fee under licenses that typically have an initial non-cancelable term of ten years. We typically share a portion of the licensing fees with the property owners.
Rooftop Management.
We also provide rooftop management services to property owners in the United States. We market over 10,000 rooftop sites to our customers in the United States that we manage for third 5 Table of Contents parties, including approximately 1,100 rooftop sites that were revenue-producing as of December31, 2005. Wireless carriers use rooftop sites to install their communications equipment, generally where there are no existing towers or where new towers are difficult to build. We obtain rights to manage a rooftop by entering into contracts with property owners, which are generally for an initial period of three-to-five years. These contracts typically contain automatic extension provisions and continue after the initial period unless terminated by either party. Under these contracts, we are engaged by property owners as the exclusive manager for a rooftop. For these services, we receive a percentage of occupancy or license fees paid by the wireless carriers.
Network Development Services We offer tower-related services through our network development services segment. We historically offered extensive tower-related services to support our site leasing business. As we continued to focus our operations on our rental and management segment, we sold services businesses that did not provide incremental value to our site leasing business. With the sale of our tower construction services unit in November 2004, we substantially completed our strategic transition to a focused site leasing company. Our network development services segment continues to provide site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services that support our site leasing operations and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites.
Site Acquisition, Zoning and Permitting Services.
We engage in site acquisition services for our own account in connection with our tower development projects, as well as for our customers. We typically work with our customers engineers to determine the geographic areas where the customer needs to construct a new tower site to address its coverage objectives. Once a new site is identified, we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed, and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site under applicable law.
Structural Analysis.
We offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of communications equipment on towers. A structural analysis of a tower is routinely performed prior to a decision by a wireless carrier to install equipment on a tower. Our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if augmentation is needed, which enables our customers to better assess potential tower sites before making an installation decision.
Recent Transactions Acquisitions From January1, 2004 through December31, 2005, we increased the size of our communications site portfolio by over 8,000 towers. Significant acquisitions included the following: SpectraSite, Inc.
In May 2005, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with SpectraSite, Inc., an owner and operator of approximately 7,800 wireless and broadcast towers and in-building systems in the United States. We completed the merger in August 2005. Under the terms of the merger agreement, SpectraSite, Inc. merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary that we formed for purposes of the merger. Each share of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock converted into the right to receive 3.575 shares of our ClassA common stock. We issued approximately 169.5million shares of ClassA common stock with respect to shares of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock outstanding as of the closing of the merger and reserved for issuance approximately 16.7million shares of ClassA common stock issuable pursuant to SpectraSite, Inc. options and warrants assumed in the merger. For more information about our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
Iusacell Celular.
In December 2003, we agreed to acquire up to 143 communications sites from Iusacell Celular (Iusacell) in Mexico for up to $31.4 million. During the year ended December31, 2005, we acquired six towers from Iusacell in Mexico for approximately $1.3 million, and as of December31, 2005, had acquired an aggregate of 137 towers for a total purchase price of $30.6 million.
6 Table of Contents NII Holdings, Inc.
In December 2002, we agreed to acquire over 500 communications sites, predominantly in Mexico, from NII Holdings (NII) for an aggregate purchase price of $100.0 million in cash. Although we have satisfied our minimum purchase obligation under the agreement, we have continued to purchase additional towers from NII. During the year ended December31, 2005, we acquired 20 towers from NII in Mexico and Brazil for approximately $2.2 million, and as of December31, 2005, had acquired an aggregate of 728 towers for a total purchase price of approximately $122.2 million. We have the option to purchase additional tower sites from NII in Mexico and Brazil through 2007. We expect to fund any additional acquisitions using funds from operations.
Dispositions From January1, 2004 through December31, 2005, we received approximately $38.9 million of proceeds from selling non-core assets and businesses. In our rental and management segment, we sold 59 non-core tower assets for approximately $11.6 million and sold five office buildings for approximately $7.5 million. In our network development services segment, we sold substantially all the net assets of Kline Iron& Steel Co., Inc. (Kline), our steel fabrication and tall tower design business, for approximately $4.0 million in cash, subject to a post closing working capital adjustment, and sold our tower construction services business for total consideration of approximately $9.1million, consisting of cash and the assumption of certain capital lease obligations by the purchaser.
Financing Transactions During the year ended December31, 2005, we improved our financial flexibility by refinancing our existing debt with less restrictive, lower cost capital, which increased our liquidity and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Significant transactions included those set forth below. For more information about our financing transactions, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the section entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources.
New Credit Facilities.
In October 2005, we refinanced the two existing credit facilities of our principal operating subsidiaries. We replaced the existing American Tower $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility with a new $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility and replaced the existing SpectraSite $900.0 million senior secured credit facility with a new $1.15 billion senior secured credit facility. As a result of the refinancing, we reduced the interest rate on our credit facilities and increased our unused borrowing capacity under our credit facilities to approximately $977.2 million.
Repurchases, Redemptions and Conversions of Debt Securities.
During the year ended December31, 2005, consistent with our strategy of replacing our higher cost, more restrictive debt with less expensive, less restrictive capital, we repurchased, redeemed and converted approximately $605.7 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities, including the repurchase of $270.6 million face amount ($177.8 million accreted value, net of $10.1 million fair value allocated to warrants) of the ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes due 2008 (ATI 12.25% Notes), the redemption of $274.9 million principal amount of our 9 3 / 8 % senior notes due 2009 (9 3 / 8 % Notes) and the conversion of $57.1 million principal amount of our 3.25% convertible notes due August15, 2012 (3.25% Notes). In addition, in December 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining outstanding $227.7 million face amount of ATI 12.25% Notes, which we redeemed on February1, 2006. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding.
Stock Repurchase Program.
In November 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our ClassA common stock through December 2006. To facilitate repurchases, we entered into a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. As of December31, 2005, we 7 Table of Contents had repurchased 2.8million shares of ClassA common stock for an aggregate of $76.6 million. Between January1, 2006 and March9, 2006, we repurchased an additional 3.9million shares of ClassA common stock for an aggregate of $117.4 million.
ATC International Transactions ATC Mexico Holding Corp.
During 2004, we repurchased a 12.0% interest in ATC Mexico from certain stockholders of ATC Mexico, including J. Michael Gearon, Jr. (Mr. Gearon) and William H. Hess (Mr. Hess), executive officers of the Company. We now own 100% of ATC Mexico as a result of these repurchases.
In April 2004, we repurchased an 8.8% interest in ATC Mexico from Mr.Gearon. In the first quarter of 2004, Mr.Gearon exercised his previously disclosed right to require us to purchase his interest in ATC Mexico. In consideration for his interest in ATC Mexico, we issued to Mr.Gearon 2,203,968 shares of our ClassA common stock and paid $3.7 million in cash, representing 80% of the aggregate purchase price for Mr.Gearons interest. The 2,203,968 shares issued to Mr.Gearon had an aggregate market value on the date of issuance of $24.8 million. Payment of the remaining 20% of the purchase price of $7.3 million, plus interest, was contingent upon ATC Mexico satisfying certain performance criteria. In February 2005, our Board of Directors determined that the performance criteria had been satisfied, and we paid Mr.Gearon $7.7 million in cash. Our Board approved the determination of the fair market value of Mr.Gearons interest with the assistance of an independent financial advisor.
In October 2004, we repurchased a 3.2% interest in ATC Mexico from certain employees, including Mr.Hess. In the first quarter of 2004, these employees exercised options to purchase an aggregate of 318 shares of ATC Mexico under the ATC Mexico Stock Option Plan. In October 2004, these employees exercised their previously disclosed rights to require us to purchase their collective 3.2% interest in ATC Mexico. In consideration for their interests in ATC Mexico, we issued to these employees (including Mr.Hess) an aggregate of 1,155,678 shares of our ClassA common stock, representing 80% of the aggregate purchase price for their collective interests. The 1,155,678 shares issued to these employees had an aggregate market value on the date of issuance of $18.5 million. Payment of the remaining 20% of the purchase price of 218,566 shares of ClassA common stock was contingent upon ATC Mexico satisfying certain performance criteria. In February 2005, our Board of Directors determined that the performance criteria had been satisfied, and we issued to these employees (including Mr.Hess) 159,836 shares of our ClassA common stock, net of 58,730 shares of ClassA common stock retained by us to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations. On the date of issuance, the aggregate market value of these 218,566 shares was $3.9 million. Our Board approved the determination of the fair market value of the interests held by these employees with the assistance of an independent financial advisor.
ATC South America Holding Corp . During 2004 and 2005, ATC South America issued shares of its common stock to certain employees, including Messrs. Gearon and Hess, and in 2005, we reacquired certain of these shares of ATC South America from these employees. As of December31, 2005, we owned 90.7% of ATC South America.
In March 2004, we consummated a previously disclosed arrangement with Mr.Gearon pursuant to which he purchased an approximate 1.6% equity interest in ATC South America for approximately $1.2 million in cash. Pursuant to the arrangement, Mr.Gearon could require us to purchase his interest in ATC South America, for its then fair market value, after December31, 2004 or upon certain events as set forth in the stockholder agreement with Mr.Gearon. In October 2005, Mr.Gearon exercised this right to require us to repurchase his interest in ATC South America. In February 2006, our Board of Directors approved the determination of the fair market value of Mr.Gearons interest in ATC South America with the assistance of an independent financial advisor, and we expect to pay Mr.Gearon $3.7 million in cash in consideration for his 1.6% interest in ATC South America.
As part of Mr.Gearons investment, ATC South Americas Board of Directors also approved the formation of the ATC South America Stock Option Plan, which provides for the issuance of options to officers, employees, 8 Table of Contents directors and consultants of ATC South America to purchase up to an aggregate 10.3% interest in ATC South America. In the first quarter of 2004, ATC South America granted options to purchase 6,024 shares of ATC South America common stock to officers and employees, including Messrs. Gearon and Hess, who received options to purchase shares representing a 6.7% and 1.6% interest, respectively. The exercise price is $1,349 per share, which was determined to be the fair market value per share on the date of issuance based on an independent appraisal performed at our request. In October 2005, in connection with the exercise by Mr.Gearon of his right to require us to purchase his interest in ATC South America, these options vested in full and were exercised. Upon exercise of these options, the holders received 4,428 shares of ATC South America, net of 1,596 shares retained by us to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations. These holders may require us to purchase their shares of ATC South America at their then fair market value six months following their issuance, which date will occur in April 2006. We anticipate that our repurchase obligation with respect to these shares in April 2006 will be approximately $19 million.
Regulatory Matters Towers and Antennas.
Both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasting. These regulations govern the siting, lighting, marking and maintenance of towers. Depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields, the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require pre-approval by the FAA. Towers requiring FAA approval must be registered with the FCC and must be painted and lighted in accordance with the FAAs standards. The FAA review and the FCC registration processes are prerequisites to use of the tower by FCC licensees, as well as our other customers. Tower owners are responsible for notifying the FAA of any tower lighting outages or malfunctions and for timely repairing lighting outages or malfunctions. Tower owners also must notify the FCC when ownership of a tower changes. We generally indemnify our customers against non-compliance with applicable standards. Non-compliance with applicable tower-related requirements may lead to monetary penalties.
The FCC considers the construction of a new tower or the addition of a new antenna to an existing site (including building rooftops and watertanks) to be a federal undertaking subject to prior environmental review and approval under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), which obligates federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impacts of undertakings to determine whether they may significantly affect the environment. The FCC has issued regulations implementing NEPA as well as the National Historic Preservation Act and the Endangered Species Act. These regulations obligate each FCC applicant or licensee to investigate potential environmental and other effects of operations and to disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment prior to constructing a tower or adding a new antenna to a site. If a tower or new antenna may have a significant impact on the environment, FCC approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 by limiting state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the construction, modification and placement of wireless communications towers. The law preserves local zoning authority but prohibits any action that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of communications towers. It also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 also requires the federal government to help licensees of wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities. This may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for towers.
We are subject to local and county zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community developers. These regulations vary greatly, but typically require tower owners and/or licensees to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Local zoning authorities and community residents often are 9 Table of Contents opposed to construction in their communities, which can delay or prevent new tower construction, new antenna installation or site upgrade projects, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand. In addition, zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction and the addition of new antennas to a site. Existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted which increase delays or result in additional costs to us. These factors could adversely affect our construction activities and operations.
Our tower operations in Mexico and Brazil are also subject to regulation. If we pursue additional international opportunities, we will be subject to regulations in additional foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our customers, both domestic and foreign, also may be subject to new regulatory policies that may adversely affect the demand for communications sites.
Environmental Matters.
Our operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are subject to various federal, state and local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials, and wastes, and the siting of our towers. As an owner, lessee and/or operator of real property and facilities, we may have liability under those laws for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes. Certain of these laws impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of or were responsible for the contamination, and whether or not we have discontinued operations or sold the property. We may also be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from off-site migration of contamination.
We, and our customers, also may be required to obtain permits, comply with regulatory requirements, and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances used at our sites. Violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines and/or criminal sanctions. In October 2001, we paid $150,000 in civil penalties and entered into a settlement agreement that expires in 2006 related to certain alleged environmental permitting and filing violations in the County of Santa Clara, California.
In November 2005, we finalized a Facilities Audit Agreement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to the EPAs voluntary audit and disclosure policy. Under the Facilities Audit Agreement, we have agreed to audit by February 2007 the tower sites in our portfolio as of July 2005 (i.e., legacy American Tower sites, but not SpectraSite sites) for compliance with the notice and record-keeping requirements under the Emergency Protection and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We will inform the EPA of any violations of the above-referenced statutes at a given tower site and take steps to cure the violations. The Facilities Audit Agreement provides for stipulated penalties for violations under EPCRA and, for violations under the remaining statutes, we will pay a penalty based on our economic benefit of non-compliance. We do not expect that the aggregate penalties payable under the Facilities Audit Agreement will be material to our financial condition or results of operations.
Health and Safety.
We are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure. Our field personnel are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and equivalent state agencies concerning health and safety matters.
Competition and Customer Demand Rental and Management Our rental and management segment competes with other national and regional tower companies (such as Crown Castle International Corp., Global Signal Inc. and SBA Communications Corp.), wireless carriers and 10 Table of Contents broadcasters that own and operate their own tower networks and lease tower space to third parties, numerous independent tower owners and the owners of non-communications tower sites, including rooftops, utility towers, water towers and other alternative structures. We believe that site location and capacity, price and quality of service historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting owners, operators and managers of communications sites.
Customer demand for our rental and management segment is also affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies. Technologies that make it possible for wireless carriers to expand their use of existing infrastructure could reduce customer demand for our communications sites. The increased use of spectrally efficient air-link technologies, such as lower-rate vocoders, which potentially can relieve some network capacity problems, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space.
In addition, any increase in the use of network sharing or roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers also could adversely affect customer demand for tower space. These arrangements, which are essentially extensions of traditional roaming agreements, enable a provider to serve customers outside its license area, to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas, and to permit non-licensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace. Consolidation among wireless carriers, such as the October 2004 merger between Cingular Wireless and AT&T Wireless and the August 2005 merger between Sprint PCS and Nextel, could have a similar impact on customer demand for our tower sites because the existing networks of many wireless carriers overlap. Although we do not expect the Cingular/AT&T Wireless merger or the Sprint PCS/Nextel merger to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, significant consolidation among wireless carriers may adversely affect demand for our tower sites and, accordingly, our revenues and cash flows.
Network Development Services Our network development services segment competes with a variety of companies offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consulting firms, tower owners/managers, telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors, and our customers internal staffs. We believe that our customers base their decisions on network development services on various criteria, including a companys experience, track record, local reputation, price, and time for completion of a project.
We believe that we compete favorably as to the key competitive factors relating to our rental and management and network development services segments.
Employees As of December31, 2005, we employed 904 full-time individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.

ITEM1A.RISK FACTORS Decrease in demand for tower space would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand.
Many of the factors affecting the demand for wireless communications tower space, and to a lesser extent our network development services business, could adversely affect our operating results. Those factors include:  a decrease in consumer demand for wireless services due to general economic conditions or other factors;  the financial condition of wireless service providers;  the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures;  the growth rate of wireless communications or of a particular wireless segment;  governmental licensing of spectrum;  mergers or consolidations among wireless service providers;  increased use of network sharing, roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers;  delays or changes in the deployment of 3G or other technologies;  zoning, environmental, health and other government regulations; and  technological changes.
The demand for broadcast antenna space is dependent on the needs of television and radio broadcasters. Among other things, technological advances, including the development of satellite-delivered radio, may reduce the need for tower-based broadcast transmission. We could also be affected adversely should the development of digital television be further delayed or impaired, or if demand for it were less than anticipated because of delays, disappointing technical performance or cost to the consumer.
If our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected.
Significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in reduced capital expenditures in the aggregate because the existing networks of many wireless carriers overlap, as do their expansion plans. For example, as a result of the recently completed mergers between Cingular Wireless and AT&T Wireless and between Sprint PCS and Nextel, both Cingular Wireless and Sprint Nextel are exploring ways of rationalizing portions of their combined, yet technologically separate, wireless networks. Certain parts of their merged networks may be deemed to be duplicative and these customers may attempt to eliminate these duplications. Our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these contracts are eliminated from our ongoing contractual revenues. Similar consequences might occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing, roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space.
12 Table of Contents In January 2003, the FCC eliminated its spectrum cap, which prohibited wireless carriers from owning more than 45 MHz of spectrum in any given geographical area. The FCC has also eliminated the cross-interest rule for metropolitan areas, which limited an entitys ability to own interests in multiple cellular licenses in an overlapping geographical service area. Also, in May 2003, the FCC adopted new rules authorizing wireless radio services holding exclusive licenses to freely lease unused spectrum. These regulatory changes may encourage consolidation among wireless carriers, which, if it resulted in a loss of one or more of our major customers, could materially decrease our revenues and cash flows.
Substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect us.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December31, 2005, we had approximately $3.6 billion of consolidated debt. Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness. As of December31, 2005, approximately 41% of our outstanding indebtedness bore interest at floating rates (approximately 21%, after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements used to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations on our credit facilities). As a result, our interest payment obligations on such indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase. Subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, we may also obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs. This would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.
Our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations, including:  impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratios contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal, which events could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt as a result of cross-default provisions;  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing;  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures;  requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete; and  placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.
Restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and indentures could adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility.
Our credit facilities and the indentures governing the terms of our debt securities contain restrictive covenants. Our credit facilities also contain requirements that the borrowers under each facility comply with certain leverage and other financial tests. These covenants and requirements limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness, engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers and sales of assets, and paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments. These covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions. Further, these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, merger and acquisition or other opportunities.
13 Table of Contents Due to the long-term expectations of revenue from tenant leases, the tower industry is sensitive to the creditworthiness of its tenants.
Due to the long-term nature of our tenant leases, we, like others in the tower industry, are dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants. Many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage. During the past few years, several of our customers have filed for bankruptcy, although to date these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues. If one or more of our major customers experience financial difficulties, it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and our loss of significant customers and anticipated lease revenues.
Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could adversely affect our revenues or financial position.
Our business operations in Mexico and Brazil, and any other possible foreign operations in the future, could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not experienced in the United States. For the year ended December31, 2005, approximately 13% of our consolidated revenues were generated by our international operations (assuming our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. occurred on January1, 2005). We anticipate that our revenues from our international operations may grow in the future. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:  changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions;  laws and regulations that restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds;  difficulty in recruiting trained personnel; and  language and cultural differences.
In addition, we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. While most of the contracts for our international operations are denominated in the U.S. dollar, others are denominated in the Mexican Peso or the Brazilian Real. We have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our non-U.S. dollar operations, and we may suffer future losses as a result of adverse changes in currency exchange rates.
A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers.
A substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of customers. For the year ended December31, 2005, after giving effect to our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. (assuming the merger occurred on January1, 2005):  Five customers accounted for approximately 59% of our revenues;  Cingular Wireless accounted for approximately 19% of our revenues;  Sprint Nextel (assuming the merger of Sprint PCS and Nextel occurred on January1, 2005) accounted for approximately 17% of our revenues (approximately 22% including Sprint Nextel partners and affiliates); and  Verizon Wireless accounted for approximately 10% of our revenues.
Our largest international customer is Iusacell Celular, which accounted for approximately 3% of our total revenues for the year ended December31, 2005 (assuming our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. occurred on January1, 2005). Iusacell is an affiliate of TV Azteca, which owns a minority interest in Unefon, which is our second largest customer in Mexico and accounted for approximately 2% of our total revenues for the year ended December31, 2005 (assuming our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. occurred on January1, 2005). In addition, we received $14.2 million in interest income, net, from TV Azteca for the year ended December31, 2005.
14 Table of Contents If any of these customers were unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under our agreements with them, our revenues, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. In the ordinary course of our business, we also sometimes experience disputes with our customers, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our agreements. Although historically we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on our company or our customer relationships, in the future these disputes could lead to a termination of our agreements with customers or a material modification of the terms of those agreements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable customer could be terminated or damaged, which could lead to decreased revenues or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Status of Iusacell Celulars financial restructuring exposes us to certain risks and uncertainties.
Iusacell Celular is our largest customer in Mexico and accounted for approximately 3% of our total revenues for the year ended December31, 2005 (assuming our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. occurred on January1, 2005). Iusacell has been in default under certain of its debt obligations and involved in litigation with certain of its creditors. While Iusacell reported in January 2006 that it has reached an agreement in principle with its creditors to restructure its debt obligations, if the restructuring is not completed, Iusacell files for bankruptcy, or the creditor litigation has an adverse impact on Iusacells overall liquidity, it could interfere with Iusacells ability to meet its operating obligations, including rental payments under our leases with them.
We may not realize the intended benefits of our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. if we are unable to integrate SpectraSites operations, wireless communications tower portfolio, customers and personnel in a timely and efficient manner, which could adversely affect our business and the value of our ClassA common stock.
Achieving the benefits of our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. depends in part on the integration of our operations, wireless communications tower portfolios and personnel with those of SpectraSite in a timely and efficient manner and the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated synergies from this integration. Integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among others, the size of SpectraSites wireless communications tower portfolio and because SpectraSites and our internal systems and processes were developed without regard to such integration. Our successful integration with SpectraSite requires coordination of different personnel, which may be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and differences in policies, procedures and operations between the companies and the different geographical locations of the companies. Our successful integration also requires attention to and maintenance of our business relationships with current customers, which if compromised, would result in disruptions to our business. If we cannot successfully integrate SpectraSites operations, wireless communications tower portfolio, customers and personnel, we may not realize the expected benefits of the merger, which could adversely affect the combined companys business and could adversely affect the value of our ClassA common stock. In addition, the integration of our business with SpectraSite may place a significant burden on management and its internal resources. The diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could harm our business and financial results of the combined company and the value of our ClassA common stock.
We expect to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of SpectraSite.
We expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the business, policies, procedures, operations and systems of SpectraSite. While we have integrated many of the companies systems and administrative activities to date, we do not expect to complete our integration efforts until the second quarter of 2006. If we fail to meet the challenges involved in integrating the companies business and operations, or we are unable to do so on a timely basis, it could result in substantial additional expenses and harm to the combined company. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the businesses.
15 Table of Contents New technologies could make our tower leasing business less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues.
The development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the use and need for tower-based wireless services transmission and reception and have the effect of decreasing demand for tower space. Examples of such technologies include technologies that enhance spectral capacity, such as lower-rate vocoders, which can increase the capacity at existing sites and reduce the number of additional sites a given carrier needs to serve any given subscriber base. In addition, the emergence of new technologies could reduce the need for tower-based broadcast services transmission and reception. For example, the growth in delivery of video services by direct broadcast satellites could adversely affect demand for our antenna space. The development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree could have an adverse effect on our operations.
We could have liability under environmental laws.
Our operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are subject to the requirements of various federal, state and local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As owner, lessee or operator of many thousands of real estate sites underlying our towers, we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of or were responsible for the contamination. Many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements. We cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all environmental requirements. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. The current cost of complying with these laws (including amounts we expect to pay the EPA pursuant to the Facilities Audit Agreement) is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. However, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do.
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulation of our business, including regulation by the FAA, the FCC, the EPA and OSHA. Both the FCC and the FAA regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio and television antennas and the FCC separately regulates transmitting devices operating on towers. Similar regulations exist in Mexico, Brazil and other foreign countries regarding wireless communications and the operation of communications towers. Local zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to construction in their communities and these regulations can delay, prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction, modifications, additions of new antennas to a site, or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demands and requirements. Existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted which increase delays or result in additional costs to us, or that prevent such projects in certain locations. These factors could adversely affect our operations.
Increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may adversely affect us.
Our industry is highly competitive, and our customers have numerous alternatives for leasing antenna space. Some of our competitors, such as national wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers, are larger and have greater financial resources than we do, while other competitors are in weak financial condition or may have lower return on investment criteria than we do. Competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could adversely affect our lease rates and services income.
16 Table of Contents In addition, if we lose customers due to pricing, we may not be able to find new customers, leading to an accompanying adverse effect on our profitability. Increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly.
Our competition includes:  national and regional tower companies;  wireless carriers that own towers and lease antenna space to other carriers;  site development companies that purchase antenna space on existing towers for wireless carriers and manage new tower construction; and  alternative site structures (e.g., building rooftops, billboards and utility poles).
If we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. A loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to operate our towers and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites. Further, we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms. Approximately 85% of the owned communications sites in our portfolio as of December31, 2005 are located on leased land. Approximately 85% of these sites are on land where our property interests in such land have a final expiration date of 2015 and beyond. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse affect on us.
If we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from such towers would be eliminated.
Our communications site portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period. If we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers under these agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from such towers would be eliminated. For example, our SpectraSite subsidiary has entered into lease or sublease agreements with affiliates of SBC Communications (SBC) with respect to approximately 2,500 towers pursuant to which SpectraSite has the option to purchase the sites upon the expiration of the lease or sublease beginning in 2013. The aggregate purchase option price for the SBC towers was approximately $282.4 million as of December31, 2005, and will accrete at a rate of 10%per year to the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site. In addition, we have entered into a similar agreement with ALLTEL with respect to approximately 1,776 towers, for which we have an option to purchase the sites upon the expiration of the lease or sublease beginning in 2016. The aggregate purchase option price for the ALLTEL towers was approximately $56.2 million as of December31, 2005, and will accrete at a rate of 3%per annum. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase these or other lease or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period. Even if we do have available capital, we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase such towers for business or other reasons. In the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights, or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of the acquisitions of such towers may not exceed the associated acquisition, compliance and integration costs, and our financial results could be adversely affected.
Our towers may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen damage for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage.
Our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, such as ice and wind storms, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as other unforeseen damage. Any damage or destruction to our towers 17 Table of Contents as a result of these or other risks would impact our ability to provide services to our customers and could impact our results of operation and financial condition. For example, as a result of the severe hurricane activity in 2005, approximately 25 of our broadcast and wireless communications sites in the southeastern United States and Mexico suffered material damage and many more suffered lesser damage. While we maintain insurance, including business interruption insurance, for our towers against these risks, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction. Further, such business interruption insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenues, including potential revenues from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the damage. If we are unable to provide services to our customers as a result of damages to our towers, it could lead to customer loss, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated.
Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks could slow the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites. The potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years, and numerous health-related lawsuits have been filed against wireless carriers and wireless device manufacturers. If a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions posed health risks to consumers, it could negatively impact the market for wireless services, as well as our wireless carrier customers, which would adversely effect our operations, costs and revenues. We do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.
The bankruptcy proceeding of our Verestar subsidiary exposes us to risks and uncertainties.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Verestar, Inc., filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in December2003. If Verestar fails to honor certain of its contractual obligations because of its bankruptcy filing or otherwise, claims may be made against us for breaches by Verestar of those contracts as to which we are primarily or secondarily liable as a guarantor (which we do not expect to exceed $3.2 million). In addition, in July 2005, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors appointed in the bankruptcy proceeding (the Committee) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and certain of our and Verestars current and former officers, directors and advisors, and also filed a complaint in the Bankruptcy Court against us. (The case initially filed in the District Court has since been transferred to the Bankruptcy Court, and both cases are now pending as a single, consolidated case before the same Bankruptcy judge.) Pursuant to the complaints, the Committee is seeking unspecified compensatory damages of not less than $150.0 million, punitive damages and various costs and fees. The outcome of this complex litigation cannot be predicted by us with certainty, is dependent upon many factors beyond our control, and could take several years to resolve. If any such claims are successful, however, they could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. For more information regarding the Verestar bankruptcy and related litigation, please see Item3 of this annual report under the caption Legal Proceedings and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.

Except for the 42,300 square feet of space occupied by our lease administration office and our broadcast division, the space in the facility is leased to unaffiliated tenants.
(2) The facility in Cary contains a total of 110,000 square feet of space. Our operations in Cary currently occupy approximately 20,000 square feet of space. We have signed a letter of intent to sell our facility in Cary. Following the sale of the facility, we expect to lease approximately 14,000 square feet of space from the new owner.
In addition to the principal offices set forth above, we maintain 14 regional area offices in the United States through which we operate our tower leasing and services businesses on a local basis. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs.
Our interests in our communications sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests, leases created by long-term lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. Pursuant to our credit facilities, our lenders have liens on, among other things, all towers, leasehold interests, tenant leases and contracts relating to the management of towers for others. A typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure, and an equipment shelter that houses a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. There are three principal types of towers: guyed, self-supporting lattice, and monopole.
A guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground. A guyed tower can reach heights of up to 2,000 feet. A guyed tower site for a typical broadcast tower can consist of a tract of land of up to 20 acres.
A lattice tower is typically tapered from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1,000 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site for a wireless communications tower can consist of a tract of land of 10,000 square feet for a rural site or less than 2,500 square feet for a metropolitan site.
A monopole is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site of the 19 Table of Contents kind typically used in metropolitan areas for a wireless communications tower can consist of a tract of land of less than 2,500 square feet.
Of the approximately 22,000 owned communications sites in our portfolio as of December31, 2005, approximately 85% are located on leased land. Ground leases for land underlying our towers generally have an initial term of five years with three or four additional automatic renewal periods of five years, for a total of twenty to twenty-five years. As a result, approximately 85% of the land leases for our sites have a final expiration date of 2015 and beyond.
ITEM3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS As previously reported, our Verestar, Inc. (Verestar) subsidiary filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in December2003. In connection with the bankruptcy filing, we asserted certain claims against Verestar as an unsecured creditor. In June 2004, the Bankruptcy Court approved a stipulation between Verestar and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors appointed in the bankruptcy proceeding (the Committee) that permits the Committee to file claims on behalf of Verestar against us, our affiliates and certain of our and Verestars current and former officers and directors. The Committee requested and received authorization from the Bankruptcy Court to take discovery of us and certain of Verestars current and former officers and directors. We produced various documents and a limited number of depositions were conducted by the Committee. In July2005, the Committee filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and certain of our and Verestars current and former officers, directors and advisors, and also filed a complaint in the Bankruptcy Court against us. (The case initially filed in the District Court has since been transferred to the Bankruptcy Court, and both cases are now pending as a single, consolidated case before the same Bankruptcy judge.) We may be obligated or may agree to indemnify certain of the defendants named in the litigation. The complaint originally filed in the District Court asserts various causes of action against the defendants, including declaratory judgment for alter ego, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, conspiracy, tortious interference with contract and business relations, deepening insolvency, and avoidance and recovery of fraudulent transfers and preferential transfers. In connection with those claims, the Committee is seeking unspecified compensatory damages of not less than $150.0 million, punitive damages and various costs and fees. The complaint originally filed in the Bankruptcy Court includes an objection to our claims against Verestar and seeks to recharacterize and equitably subordinate those claims. That complaint also seeks substantive consolidation of our assets and liabilities with Verestars assets and liabilities. During 2005, the Company, together with the individual defendants, filed motions to dismiss certain claims asserted in the complaints. In February 2006, the Bankruptcy Court heard oral arguments on the motions to dismiss, but has not yet decided any of the motions. The outcome of this complex litigation cannot be predicted by us with certainty, is dependent upon many factors beyond our control, and could take several years to resolve. In the opinion of management, the resolution of the claims made against us by the Committee will not likely have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
As previously disclosed, in June 2005, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice issued Civil Investigative Demands relating to our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., seeking information and documents from both us and SpectraSite. The Antitrust Division has the authority to require divestitures of assets by us and to seek to impose restrictions on our conduct of business following the merger to address alleged competitive concerns. We and SpectraSite cooperated with the Antitrust Division to provide the requested information and documents, and on October24, 2005, the Antitrust Division notified us that it had closed its investigation of the merger.
The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of Company management, after consultation with counsel, other than the litigation related to the Verestar bankruptcy discussed above, there are no matters currently pending which would, in the event of adverse outcome, have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The information under Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans from the Definitive Proxy Statement is hereby incorporated by reference into Item12 of this annual report.
Dividends We have never paid a dividend on any class of our common stock. We anticipate that we may retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. The indentures governing our 7.50% senior notes due 2012 (7.50% Notes) and our 7.125% senior notes due 2012 (7.125% Notes) may prohibit us from paying dividends to our stockholders unless we satisfy certain financial covenants.
Our credit facilities and the indentures governing the terms of our debt securities contain covenants that may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries from making to us any direct or indirect distribution, dividend or other payment on account of their limited liability company interests, partnership interests, capital stock or other equity interests. Under our credit facilities, the borrower subsidiaries may pay cash dividends or make other distributions to us in accordance with the applicable credit facility only if no default exists or would be created thereby. The indenture governing the terms of the ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2011 (ATI 7.25% Notes) prohibit ATI and certain of our other subsidiaries that have guaranteed those notes (sister guarantors) from paying dividends and making other payments or distributions to us unless certain financial covenants are satisfied. The indentures governing the terms of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes also contain certain restrictive covenants, which prohibit the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures from paying dividends and making other payments or distributions to us unless certain financial covenants are satisfied. For more information about the restrictions under our credit facilities and our notes indentures, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the section entitled Managements 21 Table of Contents Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesFactors Affecting Sources of Liquidity.
Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities During the year ended December31, 2005, we issued an aggregate of 4,670,335 shares of our ClassA common stock upon conversion of $57.1 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, the holders of the 3.25% Notes received 81.808 shares of ClassA common stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. The shares were issued to the noteholders in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Section3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. No underwriters were engaged in connection with such issuances. In connection with the conversion, we paid such holders an aggregate of $4.9 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes. Subsequent to December31, 2005, we issued shares of ClassA common stock upon conversions of additional 3.25% Notes, as set forth in Item9B of this annual report under the caption Other Information.
During the year ended December31, 2005, we issued an aggregate of 398,412 shares of our ClassA common stock upon exercises of 55,729 warrants assumed in our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. In August 2005, in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., we assumed approximately 1.0million warrants to purchase shares of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock. Upon completion of the merger, each warrant to purchase shares of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock automatically converted into a warrant to purchase 7.15 shares of ClassA common stock at an exercise price of $32 per warrant. Net proceeds from these warrant exercises were approximately $1.8 million. The shares of ClassA common stock issued to the warrantholders upon exercise of the warrants were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Section3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. No underwriters were engaged in connection with such issuances. Subsequent to December31, 2005, we issued shares of ClassA common stock upon exercises of additional warrants, as set forth in Item9B of this annual report under the caption Other Information.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities In November 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we intend to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our ClassA common stock through December 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we repurchased 2,836,519 shares of our ClassA common stock for an aggregate of $76.6 million pursuant to our stock repurchase program, as follows: Period TotalNumber of Shares Purchased(1) Average PricePaid per Share TotalNumberofShares PurchasedasPartofPublicly AnnouncedPlansorPrograms(1) ApproximateDollarValueofShares that May Yet be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (In millions) 11/17/05  11/30/05 874,306 $ 26.25 874,306 $ 727.0 12/1/05  12/31/05 1,962,213 $ 27.29 1,962,213 $ 673.4 TotalFourthQuarter 2,836,519 $ 26.97 2,836,519 $ 673.4 (1) All issuer repurchases were made pursuant to the stock repurchase program publicly announced in November 2005. Pursuant to the program, we intend to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our ClassA common stock during the period November 2005 through December 2006. Under the program, our management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we entered into a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. The program may be discontinued at any time.
Since December31, 2005, we have continued to repurchase shares of our ClassA common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Between January1, 2006 and March9, 2006, we repurchased 3.9million shares of ClassA common stock for an aggregate of $117.4 million pursuant to the stock repurchase program.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA You should read the selected financial data in conjunction with our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
Our continuing operations are reported in two segments: rental and management and network development services. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented in this Selected Financial Data have been adjusted to reflect certain businesses as discontinued operations (see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report).
Year-to-year comparisons are significantly affected by our acquisitions, dispositions and, to a lesser extent, construction of towers. Our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., which closed in August 2005, significantly impacts the comparability of reported results between periods. Our principal acquisitions and dispositions are described in BusinessRecent Transactions and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.

Accordingly, we ceased amortizing goodwill on January1, 2002. The statements of operations for all periods presented, except for the year ended December31, 2001, do not include goodwill amortization. The amortization of goodwill for the year ended December31, 2001 was approximately $67.0 million.
(2) We computed basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each period presented. We have excluded shares issuable upon exercise of options and other common stock equivalents from these computations, as their effect is anti-dilutive.
(3) For the purpose of this calculation, earnings consists of loss from continuing operations before income taxes, fixed charges (excluding interest capitalized), minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries, losses from equity investments and amortization of interest capitalized. Fixed charges consist of interest expense, including amounts capitalized, amortization of debt discount and related issuance costs and the component of rental expense associated with operating leases believed by management to be representative of the interest factor thereon. We had a deficiency in earnings to fixed charges in each period as follows (in thousands): 2005$125,384; 2004$311,831; 2003$315,903; 2002$409,814; 2001$535,048.
(4) As of December31, 2005 and 2004, no escrows are required under the terms of the credit facilities. Includes, as of December31, 2003, approximately $170.0 million of restricted funds that were held in escrow to pay, repurchase, redeem or retire certain of our outstanding debt through January 2004. Includes, as of December31, 2001, approximately $94.1 million of restricted funds required under the previous credit facility to be held in escrow.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates on page 41.
Our continuing operations are reported in two business segments: rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment profit (loss) as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment operating profit (loss) as segment revenues less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense, corporate general, administrative and development expense, and impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense. Segment profit (loss) for the rental and management segment includes interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements).
Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 98.4% and 96.9% of our total revenues and approximately 99.5% and 99.3% of our segment operating profit for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases, leasing additional space on our existing towers, acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from wireless broadband-services customers.
The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five-to-ten years, with multiple five-year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2005 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three-to-five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable term of the applicable agreement.
The revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi-year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment. During 2005, tenant leases representing less than 2% of our total revenues were cancelled.
A significant majority of our revenue growth in 2005 was attributable to revenue generated from leasing space on the towers and in-building systems acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. In August 2005, we completed our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., an owner and operator of approximately 7,800 wireless and broadcast towers and in-building systems in the United States. The merger was approved by our and SpectraSites stockholders on August3, 2005, and the results of operations of SpectraSite have been included in 25 Table of Contents our consolidated results of operations since that date. During the period August3, 2005 through December31, 2005, SpectraSite generated total revenues of $171.2 million and operating profit of $106.8 million.
Our revenue growth in 2005 was also attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites. During 2005, incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between January1, 2004 and December31, 2005, was approximately $63.3 million, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators net of straight line accounting treatment and favorable currency exchange rate changes, offset by lease cancellations.
Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing sites. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. We believe leasing additional space on our existing sites, including the sites acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., will continue to contribute the substantial majority of our year-over-year revenue growth in 2006.
We also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites. In addition to the approximately 7,800 towers and in-building systems acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., we constructed or acquired 289 and 275 sites in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above, our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition, which affects year-over-year comparisons. During 2005, revenue attributable to these 564 sites that were built or acquired between January1, 2004 and December31, 2005, was approximately $10.8 million.
Our rental and management segment operating expenses are comprised of two major categories: direct tower level expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Our direct tower level expenses consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and utilities. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments, such as sales and property management functions, and are included in our rental and management and network development services segment operating expenses. These segment level expenses exclude corporate, general and administrative expenses, which are included in corporate general, administrative and development expense. In general, our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses do not increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year over year. As a result, leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow. Our profit margin growth is, therefore, directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period.

Approximately $171.2 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in other rental and management revenue of $74.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of $7.2 million.
Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December31, 2005 was $929.8 million, an increase of $245.3 million from the year ended December31, 2004. Approximately $171.2 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. Approximately $63.3 million of the increase resulted from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January1, 2004 and December31, 2005, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing 27 Table of Contents tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators net of straight-line accounting treatment and favorable currency exchange rates, offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $10.8 million of the increase resulted from revenue generated by the approximately 560 communications sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January1, 2004, other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger. We believe that our rental and management revenue will increase as we continue to utilize existing site capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers.
Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December31, 2005 was $15.0 million, a decrease of $7.2 million from year ended December31, 2004. The decrease in revenue was attributable to a decline in revenues generated by our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services, primarily as a result of our strategic focus on our core site leasing business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues generated by our structural analysis services, as a result of the increased business associated with our significantly larger site portfolio following our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. As we continue to focus on and grow our site leasing business, and offer only limited services that directly support our site leasing operations and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to decrease as a percentage of our total revenues.
Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December31, 2005 were $801.6 million, an increase of $164.7 million from the year ended December31, 2004. The increase was attributable to an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $81.8 million, an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $68.8 million, an increase in corporate general, administrative and development expense of $10.5 million, and an increase in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $10.4 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in expenses within our network development services segment of $6.8 million. We expect our total operating expenses for the year ended December31, 2006 to increase by approximately $35.0 million to $38.0 million related to the January1, 2006 adoption of SFAS No.123R regarding equitybased compensation expense, as described below in Recent Accounting Pronouncements.
Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December31, 2005 was $306.1 million, an increase of $68.8 million from the year ended December31, 2004. Approximately $64.4 million of the increase was attributable to expenses incurred by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted primarily from an increase in expenses related to the approximately 560 communications sites acquired and/or constructed since January1, 2004 other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger, due to their inclusion in our results for a full year in 2005.
Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December31, 2005 was $637.8 million, an increase of $176.4 million from the year ended December31, 2004. Approximately $106.8 million of the increase was attributable to rental and management segment profit generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted primarily from additional revenue from adding tenants to communications sites that existed as of January1, 2004 and revenue generated on the approximately 560 communications sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January1, 2004 other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger, and the impact of favorable currency exchange rates.
Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December31, 2005 was $12.0 million, a decrease of $6.8 million from the year ended December31, 2004. The majority of the decrease correlates directly to the decline in services performed as noted above.
28 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December31, 2005 was $411.3 million, an increase of $81.8 million from the year ended December31, 2004. The increase was attributable to approximately $78.0 million of depreciation, amortization and accretion expense related to long-lived assets acquired in connection with the SpectraSite merger and approximately $3.8 million related to other newly acquired or constructed towers and other long-lived assets. We expect our depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December31, 2006 to increase by approximately $131.0 million, including approximately $110.0 million related to the inclusion of a full year of expense related to acquired SpectraSite long-lived assets and approximately $21.0 million related to the acceleration of settlement date assumptions regarding our asset retirement obligations described below.
Corporate General, Administrative and Development Expense Corporate general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December31, 2005 was $38.0 million, an increase of $10.5 million from the year ended December31, 2004. Approximately $7.3 million of the increase was attributable to corporate general and administrative expense incurred by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase was primarily attributable to employee bonuses, primarily paid in connection with the closing of the SpectraSite merger.
Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December31, 2005 was $34.2 million, an increase of $10.4 million from the year ended December31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to merger related expense of $9.0 million incurred in connection with the SpectraSite merger, including employee separation costs of $3.1 million, amortization of unearned compensation relating to unvested stock options assumed of $2.4 million and other employee stock option charges of $3.5 million. Restructuring expense and stock-based compensation expense also increased by $4.6 million related to modified option awards, which was partially offset by a decline of $3.2 million in impairments and net losses on sales of long-lived non-core assets.
Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December31, 2005 was $222.4 million, a decrease of $39.8 million from the year ended December31, 2004. The decrease resulted primarily as a result of the redemption of all of our outstanding 9 3 / 8 % Notes, repurchases of our ATI 12.25% Notes, conversions of our 3.25% Notes and the refinancing of the American Tower credit facility at lower interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by a full year of interest payable on our 7.50% Notes, 3.00% convertible notes due August15, 2012 (3.00% Notes) Notes and 7.125% Notes issued in February, August and September of 2004, respectively, and approximately $15.2 million of interest expense incurred on the debt assumed in the SpectraSite merger.
Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations During the year ended December31, 2005, we redeemed $274.9 million principal amount of our 9 3 / 8 % Notes, repurchased $177.8 million accreted value of our ATI 12.25% Notes and converted $57.1 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. In addition, we refinanced the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $67.1 million charge primarily related to the write-off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value. For more information regarding our financing activities, see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancing Activities below.
During the year ended December31, 2004, we redeemed all of our outstanding 6.25% convertible notes, redeemed and repurchased portions of our outstanding 9 3 / 8 % Notes, ATI 12.25% Notes and 5.0% convertible notes, and refinanced of our credit facility. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $138.0 million charge related to the write-off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value.
29 Table of Contents Other Income Other income for the year ended December31, 2005 was $0.2 million, a decrease of $3.0 million from other expense of $2.8 million for the year ended December31, 2004. The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $2.9 million of other income generated on interest rate swap agreements assumed in the SpectraSite merger.
Income Tax (Provision) Benefit The income tax provision for the year ended December31, 2005 was $4.0 million, as compared to an $80.2 million tax benefit for the year ended December31, 2004, representing a decrease of $84.2 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 3.1% for the year ended December31, 2005, as compared to 25.5% for the year ended December31, 2004. The provision for the year ended December31, 2005 reflects a $29.5 million charge as a result of a reduction in managements estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims based upon the current status of the claims, as described below.
The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December31, 2005 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to our refund claims as more fully described below and foreign items. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December31, 2004 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to capital losses and foreign items.
We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003, of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately $90.0 million. Based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities, we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $65.0 million as a result of these claims by the end of 2006. There can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of any refund.
Minority Interest in Net Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries for the year ended December31, 2005 was $0.6 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from the year ended December31, 2004. The decrease is primarily a result of the Companys purchase during 2004 of the remaining 12.0% interest in ATC Mexico that it did not own.
Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December31, 2005 was $1.9 million, as compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December31, 2004. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December31, 2005 primarily represents the legal costs incurred in connection with our involvement in the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings. We also expect to incur additional costs in connection with these proceedings. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December31, 2004 includes $7.7 million related to the results of operations through the date of sale of our tower construction services unit and Kline, as well as a net loss on disposal of our tower construction services unit of $1.7 million and a $1.1 million net gain related to a contractual obligation that was settled for less than its original estimate.
Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net As of December31, 2005, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN No.47). As a result, we recognized a $35.5 million charge (net of an $11.7 million tax benefit) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2005. The 30 Table of Contents adoption of FIN No.47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of settlement date assumptions regarding our asset retirement obligations, as FIN No.47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our settlement date assumptions. The acceleration of our settlement date assumptions also resulted in an increase to the tower assets included in property and equipment, net of $66.9 million and an increase in the asset retirement obligations included in other long-term obligations of $114.0 million.
Years Ended December31, 2004 and 2003 Year Ended December31, Amountof Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2004 2003 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 684,422 $ 619,697 $ 64,725 10 % Network development services 22,238 12,796 9,442 74 Total revenues 706,660 632,493 74,167 12 OPERATING EXPENSES: Rental and management 237,312 236,680 632 1 Network development services 18,801 9,493 9,308 98 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 329,449 330,414 (965 ) (1 ) Corporate general, administrative and development expense 27,468 26,867 601 2 Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense 23,876 31,656 (7,780 ) (25 ) Total operating expenses 636,906 635,110 1,796 1 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,497 and $1,496 14,316 14,222 94 1 Interest income 4,844 5,255 (411 ) (8 ) Interest expense (262,237 ) (279,783 ) (17,546 ) (6 ) Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (138,016 ) (46,197 ) 91,819 199 Other expense (2,798 ) (8,598 ) (5,800 ) (67 ) Income tax benefit 80,176 77,796 2,380 3 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (2,366 ) (3,703 ) (1,337 ) (36 ) Loss on equity method investments (2,915 ) (21,221 ) (18,306 ) (86 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net (8,345 ) (60,475 ) (52,130 ) (86 ) Net loss $ (247,587 ) $ (325,321 ) $ (77,734 ) (24 )% Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December31, 2004 were $706.7 million, an increase of $74.2 million from the year ended December31, 2003. The increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of $64.7 million and an increase in network development services revenue of $9.4 million.
Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December31, 2004 was $684.4 million, an increase of $64.7 million from the year ended December31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from adding additional wireless and broadband tenants to towers that existed as of January1, 2003 and, to a lesser extent, from revenue generated on the approximately 900 towers acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January1, 2003. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenue on the approximately 400 owned towers sold or disposed 31 Table of Contents of subsequent to January1, 2003. In 2004, our revenue growth on towers that existed during the entire period beginning January1, 2003 and ending December31, 2004, was approximately $51 million. We believe that our rental and management revenue will continue to grow as we utilize existing tower capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers.
Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December31, 2004 was $22.2 million, an increase of $9.4 million from the year ended December31, 2003. The increase in revenues during 2004 resulted primarily from a long-term construction contract that we did not have in the prior year.
In October 2004, we entered into an agreement to sell our tower construction services unit. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2004, we reported our tower construction services unit as a discontinued operation. The sale closed in November 2004. After the sale, our network development services segment is focused on providing complementary non-construction services to the rental and management segment, including site acquisition, zoning, permitting and structural analysis.
Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December31, 2004 were $636.9 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December31, 2003. The principal components of the increase were attributable to expense increases in our network development services segment of $9.3 million, our rental and management segment of $0.6 million and corporate general, administrative and development expense of $0.6 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense of $7.8 million and in depreciation, amortization and accretion of $1.0 million.
Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December31, 2004 was $237.3 million, an increase of $0.6 million from the year ended December31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from our acquisition/construction of approximately 900 towers partially offset by a reduction in expenses related to the 400 towers that were sold or disposed of subsequent to January 2003, coupled with an overall decrease in rental and management segment expenses.
Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December31, 2004 was $461.4 million, an increase of $64.2 million from the year ended December31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from adding additional broadband tenants to existing towers and newly acquired and/or constructed towers.
Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December31, 2004 was $18.8 million, an increase of $9.3 million from the year ended December31, 2003. The increase in expenses during 2004 resulted primarily from expenses associated with a long-term construction contract that we did not have in the prior year.
Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-Lived Assets and Restructuring Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense for the year ended December31, 2004 was $23.9 million, a decrease of $7.8 million from the year ended December31, 2003. The majority of the decrease resulted from decreased impairments and losses on sales of long-lived tower and other non-core assets.
32 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December31, 2004 was $262.2 million, a decrease of $17.5 million from the year ended December31, 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from the retirement of a portion of our 9 3 / 8 % Notes and ATI 12.25% Notes partially offset by additional interest incurred related to the issuance of our 3.00% Notes, 7.125% Notes and 7.50% Notes in 2004.
Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations During the year ended December31, 2004, we retired all or a portion of our 6.25% convertible notes, 9 3 / 8 % Notes and ATI 12.25% Notes. As a result, we incurred a charge of approximately $103.2 million, which represented the cash paid in excess of the carrying value of the debt at the time of retirement. In addition, we also incurred a charge of $34.8 million related to the write-off of deferred financing fees related to the retirements discussed above, the retirement of a portion of our 5.0% convertible notes and the refinancing of our credit facility. The total of these charges, $138.0 million, represents our loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December31, 2004.
During the year ended December31, 2003, we amended our credit facility and made certain prepayments and unscheduled principal payments on the term loans thereunder, which collectively reduced the borrowing capacity under our credit facility. As a result, we recorded an aggregate charge of approximately $11.9 million related to the write-off of deferred financing fees associated with the reduction in our overall borrowing capacity. We also repurchased a portion of our 2.25% convertible notes and 5.0% convertible notes (inclusive of the cash tender offer for our 2.25% convertible notes that expired on October22, 2003) throughout the year. As a result, we incurred an aggregate charge of approximately $34.3 million, which primarily represented the fair market value of the shares of stock issued to our 2.25% convertible note holders in excess of the shares originally issuable upon conversion of the notes, offset by a net gain on the repurchases of our 5.0% convertible notes. The total of these charges, $46.2 million, represents our loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December31, 2003.
Other Expense Other expense for the year ended December31, 2004 was $2.8 million, a decrease of $5.8 million from the year ended December31, 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from fees and expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with a financing transaction that we did not consummate as a result of the ATI 12.25% Notes offering.
Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December31, 2004 was $80.2 million, an increase of $2.4million from the year ended December31, 2003. The effective tax rate was 25.5% for the year ended December31, 2004, as compared to 24.5% for the year ended December31, 2003. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate is a result of non-deductible losses on retirements of our debt in 2003.
The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December31, 2004 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to capital losses and foreign items. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December31, 2003 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, foreign items and non-deductible losses on retirement of our debt.
In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to carrying back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003. As of December31, 2004, we anticipated receiving a refund of approximately $90.0 million as a result of these claims and estimated recovery of these amounts within two to three years of the dates the claims were filed with the IRS.
33 Table of Contents Loss on Equity Method Investments Loss on equity method investments for the year ended December31, 2004 was $2.9 million, a decrease of $18.3 million from the year ended December31, 2003. The decrease is primarily due to an impairment charge recorded on one of our equity investments of $19.3 million in 2003.
Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December31, 2004 was $8.3 million, as compared to $60.5 million for the year ended December31, 2003. In October 2004, we committed to a plan to sell our tower construction services unit, which was subsequently sold in November 2004. In addition, we sold Kline in March 2004. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December31, 2004 includes $7.7 million related to the results of these operations through the date of sale. In addition, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December31, 2004 includes a net loss on disposal of our tower construction services unit of $1.7 million and a $1.1 million net gain related to a contractual obligation that was settled for less than its original estimate.
During 2003, we disposed of two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Galaxy Engineering and Flash Technologies, two office buildings and two subsidiaries of Verestar. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December31, 2003 includes $12.0 million related to the results of these operations, Kline and the remaining operations of Verestar through the date of its bankruptcy filing in December 2003. In addition to the above, loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December31, 2003 includes the following net losses on disposal: (a)an impairment charge of $26.5 million to reduce the carrying amount of our investment in Verestar to zero and to record our estimate of costs that we may incur under certain contractual obligations; (b)an impairment charge of $14.6 million to reduce the carrying value of Klines net assets to the estimated proceeds expected upon disposal; (c)a $2.4 million net loss on the disposal of Galaxy; (d)a $3.7 million net loss on the disposal of the office buildings; and (e)a $0.1 million net gain on the sale of Flash.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the year ended December31, 2005, we improved our financial flexibility by refinancing our existing debt with less restrictive, lower cost capital, which increased our liquidity and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Significant transactions included the following:  In October 2005, we refinanced the two existing credit facilities of our principal operating subsidiaries. We replaced the existing American Tower $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility with a new $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility and replaced the existing SpectraSite $900.0 million senior secured credit facility with a new $1.15 billion senior secured credit facility.
During 2005, consistent with our strategy of replacing our higher cost, more restrictive debt with less expensive, less restrictive capital, we repurchased, redeemed and converted approximately $605.7 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities. In addition, in December 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining outstanding $227.7 million face amount of ATI 12.25% Notes, which we redeemed on February1, 2006. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding.
In November 2005, we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we intend to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our ClassA common stock through December 2006. As of December31, 2005, we had repurchased 2.8million shares of ClassA common stock for an aggregate of $76.6 million.
As of December31, 2005, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $3.6 billion. We incurred substantially all of this indebtedness to refinance indebtedness incurred prior to 2002 to fund the acquisition of 34 Table of Contents tower sites and services businesses, and capital expenditures related to the construction of new tower sites. Beginning in 2002, we significantly reduced our acquisitions and new tower construction activities, and began to focus on reducing our overall indebtedness. In 2003, 2004 and 2005, we continued this effort by refinancing indebtedness to extend maturity dates, reduce interest expense and improve our financial flexibility, and since 2004, by using cash flow from operations to repurchase and redeem outstanding debt to reduce our net total indebtedness.
In 2005, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations. We believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending December31, 2006 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2006. For information about our outstanding indebtedness, see Contractual Obligations below.
We expect our 2006 cash needs related to indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2005, to consist primarily of the following: debt service, including cash interest of approximately $189.0 million, approximately $179.5 million for the February1, 2006 redemption of the remaining outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes, and capital lease payments and other notes payable (including interest) of approximately $5.2 million. We expect to fund capital expenditures of between $110.0 and $130.0 million, principally related to new tower construction, improvements to existing towers and installation of new in-building systems in 2006. We also expect to use approximately $22.7 million in cash to purchase the remaining shares of ATC South America that we do not own, as discussed above in BusinessRecent TransactionsATC International Transactions. In addition, we expect to continue to fund our stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we intend to purchase up to an additional $673.4 million of our ClassA common stock in 2006. We also may fund additional purchases of our Class A common stock, either pursuant to, or supplemental to, our stock repurchase program. We expect to meet these cash needs through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities.
Uses of Cash Stock Repurchase Program.
In November 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our ClassA common stock through December 2006. We expect to utilize cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and cash on hand to fund the repurchase program. Under the program, our management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we entered into a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self- imposed trading blackout periods. The program may be discontinued at any time. As of December31, 2005, we had repurchased 2.8million shares of ClassA common stock for an aggregate of $76.6 million. Between January 1, 2006 and March9, 2006, we repurchased an additional 3.9million shares of our ClassA common stock for an aggregate of $117.4 million pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
Tower Construction and Improvements and In-Building System Installation.
During the year ended December31, 2005, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $88.6 million, including capital expenditures incurred in connection with the construction of 245 towers and the installation of 14 in-building systems. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that can provide the highest potential returns in light of existing market conditions. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our investment criteria. We anticipate that in 2006 we will build approximately 275 new towers and install approximately 40 new in-building systems, and expect our 2006 total capital expenditures for construction, improvements and corporate purposes to be between approximately $110.0 million and $130.0 million.
Refinancing and Repurchases of Debt.
In order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness, reduce interest expense and improve our financial flexibility, we use our cash to refinance and repurchase our 35 Table of Contents outstanding indebtedness. During the year ended December31, 2005, we repurchased, redeemed and converted approximately $605.7 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities. For more information about our financing activities, see Financing Activities below. In October 2005, we also refinanced the American Tower credit facility and the SpectraSite credit facility with new credit facilities. (See Sources of Cash below.) In addition, in December 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining outstanding $227.7 million face amount of ATI 12.25% Notes, which we redeemed on February1, 2006. (See Financing Activities below.) Contractual Obligations.
Our contractual obligations relate primarily to borrowings under the credit facilities and our outstanding notes. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December31, 2005 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total AmericanTowercreditfacility(1) Revolving credit facility Term Loan A $ 750,000 $ 750,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan 43,000 43,000 SpectraSite credit facility (1) Revolving credit facility Term Loan A 700,000 700,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes(2) $ 179,488 179,488 7.25% senior subordinated notes $ 400,000 400,000 7.50% senior notes 225,000 225,000 7.125% senior notes 500,000 500,000 5.0% convertible notes (3) $ 275,688 275,688 3.25% convertible notes 152,911 152,911 3.00% convertible notes 345,000 345,000 2.25% convertible notes 47 47 Long-term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable 179,535 275,688 1,645,911 1,470,000 3,571,134 Cash interest expense (1)(2) 189,000 177,000 $ 175,000 $ 175,000 161,000 138,000 1,015,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 5,241 4,395 4,025 3,719 3,776 212,743 233,899 Operating lease payments (4) 190,129 183,595 180,910 178,456 172,060 2,507,444 3,412,594 Other long-term liabilities (5) 400 1,098 437 450 463 165,071 167,919 Total $ 564,305 $ 641,776 $ 360,372 $ 357,625 $ 1,983,210 $ 4,493,258 $ 8,400,546 (1) For more information regarding the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities, see Sources of Cash below. Interest rates for the revolving loan and the term loan components of each of the credit facilities are determined at the option of the borrowers under the facility and range between 0.50% and 1.25% above the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.0% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on the applicable borrowers debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each credit facility is required, ranging from 0.10% to 0.375%per annum, based on the applicable borrowers debt ratings. As discussed in Item7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the credit facilities. As a result of these swap agreements, the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at December31, 2005 for the credit facilities was 4.71%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the credit facilities, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin, as defined in our credit facilities agreements, is 4.53% through their maturity on October27, 2010.
(2) The ATI 12.25% Notes accrue no cash interest. Instead, the accreted value of each note increases between the date of original issuance and maturity (August 1, 2008) at a rate of 12.25%per annum. As of December31, 2005, the remaining 36 Table of Contents outstanding debt under the ATI 12.25% Notes was $227.7 million face amount ($160.3 million accreted value, net of $7.2 million fair value allocated to warrants). On December22, 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption on February1, 2006, of all remaining outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes. Pursuant to the indenture for the notes, once a notice to redeem is issued, notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date. On February1, 2006 we redeemed $227.7 million face amount of ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding.
(3) The holders of our 5.0% convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to their maturity date in 2010, but we may pay the purchase price by issuing shares of our ClassA common stock, subject to certain conditions. The obligation with respect to the right of the holders to put the 5.0% convertible notes on February20, 2007, has been classified as a cash obligation for 2007.
(4) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non-cancelable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease.
(5) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long-term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash.
The above table does not include certain commitments relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements as of December31, 2005, as we cannot currently estimate the timing and amounts of such payments. (See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.) Sources of Cash American Tower Corporation is a holding company, and our cash flows are derived solely from distributions from our operating subsidiaries. Our principal United States operating subsidiaries are ATI and SpectraSite. Our principal international operating subsidiary is American Tower International, Inc. Under the American Tower credit facility and the indentures for our senior notes and the ATI notes, ATI and American Tower International are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that can be distributed to us. SpectraSite is subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that can be distributed to us under the SpectraSite credit facility, but as a result of its designation as an unrestricted subsidiary, it is not subject to such restrictions under the indentures for our senior notes and the ATI notes.
Total Liquidity at December31, 2005.
As of December31, 2005, we had approximately $1.047 billion of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $112.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $488.8 million under the American Tower credit facility and approximately $445.4 million under the SpectraSite credit facility.
Cash Generated by Operations.
For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our cash provided by operating activities was $397.2 million, $216.7 million and $156.4 million, respectively. Each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2006 in excess of their cash needs for operations and expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. (See Results of Operations above.) We expect to use the excess cash generated by operations principally to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures and repurchases of our ClassA common stock.
New Credit Facilities.
In October 2005, we refinanced the two existing credit facilities of our principal operating subsidiaries. We replaced the existing American Tower $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility with a new $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility and replaced the existing SpectraSite $900.0 million senior secured credit facility with a new $1.15 billion senior secured credit facility.
The new American Tower credit facility consists of a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, a $750.0 million Term Loan A, and a $250.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. At closing, we drew down the entire 37 Table of Contents Term Loan A and used the net proceeds to repay principal and interest on the outstanding $745.0 million under the previous American Tower credit facility. At closing, we had approximately $300.0 million of availability under the revolving credit facility, against which approximately $18.2 million of undrawn letters of credit were outstanding, and had the ability to draw down the entire $250.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. In December 2005, we drew down $43.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan to finance repurchases of the ATI 12.25% Notes. In January 2006, we drew down an additional $179.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan to finance the redemption of the remaining outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes. The credit facility provides that any portion of the Delayed Draw Term Loan that is not drawn as of October27, 2006 will be canceled.
The borrowers under the American Tower credit facility include ATI, American Tower, L.P., American Tower International and American Tower LLC. We and the borrowers restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the loan agreement) have guaranteed all of the loans under the credit facility. These loans are secured by liens on and security interests in substantially all assets of the borrowers and the restricted subsidiaries. The American Tower credit facility has a term of five years, maturing on October27, 2010, and all amounts will be due and payable in full at maturity. The American Tower credit facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the borrowers option without penalty or premium. For more information regarding the new American Tower credit facility, please see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
The new SpectraSite credit facility consists of a $250.0 million revolving credit facility, a $700.0 million Term Loan A, and a $200.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. At closing, we drew down the entire Term Loan A and used the net proceeds to repay principal and interest on the $697.0 million outstanding under the previous SpectraSite credit facility. At closing, we had approximately $250.0 million of availability under the revolving credit facility, against which approximately $4.6 million of undrawn letters of credit were outstanding, and had the ability to draw down the entire $200.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. The credit facility provides that any portion of the Delayed Draw Term Loan that is not drawn as of October27, 2006 will be canceled.
The borrower under the SpectraSite credit facility is SpectraSite Communications. SpectraSite Communications, its parent company (SpectraSite, LLC), and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the loan agreement) have guaranteed all of the loans under the credit facility. These loans are secured by liens on and security interests in substantially all assets of the borrower and the restricted subsidiaries. The SpectraSite credit facility has a term of five years, maturing on October27, 2010, and all amounts will be due and payable in full at maturity. The SpectraSite credit facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the borrowers option without penalty or premium. For more information regarding the new SpectraSite credit facility, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
Proceeds from the Sale of Equity Securities.
We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our stock option and stock purchase plans and upon exercise of warrants to purchase our equity securities. For the year ended December31, 2005, we received approximately $1.8 million in proceeds from exercises of warrants to purchase shares of our ClassA common stock and approximately $63.6 million in proceeds from sales of shares of our ClassA common stock pursuant to our stock option and stock purchase plans.
Financing Activities 9 3 / 8 % Notes Redemptions . During the year ended December31, 2005, we redeemed an aggregate of $274.9 million principal amount of our 9 3 / 8 % Notes, representing all of the outstanding 9 3 / 8 % Notes. We completed partial redemptions of the 9 3 / 8 % Notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture in January, July and September 2005 for an aggregate redemption price of $288.3 million, plus approximately $9.5 million in accrued interest.
ATI 12.25% Notes Repurchases . During the year ended December31, 2005, we repurchased an aggregate of $270.6 million face amount of our ATI 12.25% Notes ($177.8 million accreted value, net of $10.1 million fair 38 Table of Contents value allocated to warrants) for approximately $208.4 million in cash, in privately negotiated transactions. As of December31, 2005, we had outstanding $227.7 face amount of our ATI 12.25% Notes ($160.3 million accreted value, net of $7.2 million fair value allocated to warrants). In December 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes. On February1, 2006, we redeemed an aggregate of $227.7 million face amount of ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding.
3.25% Convertible Notes Conversions.
During the year ended December31, 2005, holders of an aggregate of $57.1 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes converted their notes into an aggregate of 4.7million shares of our ClassA common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, the holders of the 3.25% Notes received 81.808 shares of our ClassA common stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. In connection with the conversion, we paid such holders an aggregate of $4.9 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and the discounted value of future interest payments on the notes. As of December31, 2005, $152.9 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes remained outstanding. Between January 1, 2006 and March9, 2006, holders of an additional $22.5 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes converted their notes into an aggregate of 1.8million shares of our ClassA common stock. In connection with the conversion, we paid such holders an aggregate of $1.7 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and the discounted value of future interest payments on the notes.
Interest Rate Swap Agreements . In the fourth quarter of 2005, we entered into eight interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under our new credit facilities. The swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $450.0 million, a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 4.85% and expire in October 2010. During January 2006, we also entered into two additional interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million, a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 4.68% and will expire in October 2010. We have designated these swaps as cash flow hedges.
Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds.
Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2005 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it to operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for antenna space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services and our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers.
Restrictions Under Credit Facilities.
The American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries must comply. Each credit facility contains the following two financial maintenance tests with which the borrowers under the applicable credit facility must comply:  a leverage ratio (Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 5.50 to 1.00 for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries; and  an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00 for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries.
As of December31, 2005, we were in compliance with all of the foregoing financial tests.
Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the American Tower credit facility or the SpectraSite credit facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the 39 Table of Contents revolving loans, but would constitute a default, resulting in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. The credit facilities allow us to use borrowings for general corporate purposes and, provided certain conditions are met, permit the use of borrowings under the credit facilities and internally generated funds to repurchase our equity securities and repurchase and refinance other indebtedness without additional lender approval.
Restrictions Under Notes Indentures.
The indenture governing the terms of the ATI 7.25% Notes contains certain covenants which further restrict ATI, the sister guarantors (as defined) and its and their subsidiaries in addition to the restrictions set forth in the American Tower credit facility. These include restrictions on their ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. SpectraSite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture for the ATI 7.25% Notes and are not subject to such restrictions. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, the indenture restricts ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock, other than debt under the American Tower credit facility, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings, up to $1.6 billion.
The indentures governing the terms of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. SpectraSite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes and are not subject to such restrictions. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 7.5 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow. We are permitted, however, to incur debt under our credit facilities even if we are not in compliance with this ratio, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of our credit facilities.
If a default occurred under any of our credit facilities or other debt securities, the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated, and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the credit facilities until we cured the default. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial ratios defined in the credit facilities agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.
As of December31, 2005, our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations (principal and interest) for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately: $373.8 million, $457.1 million, $179.0 million, $178.7 million, $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. In addition, as a holding company, we depend on distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries, or funds raised through debt and equity offerings, to fund our debt obligations. Although the agreements governing the terms of our credit facilities and the indenture for the ATI 7.25% Notes permit our subsidiaries to make distributions to us to permit us to meet our debt service obligations, such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances. Accordingly, if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt, and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts.
Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations, and our ability to refinance such debt obligations, will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control, as outlined above in Item1A of this annual report under the caption Risk Factors. In addition, our ability to refinance any of our debt in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies, which are dependent on our expected financial performance, the liquidity factors discussed above, and the rating agencies outlook for our industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such refinancings or, if such refinancings are obtained, that the terms will be commercially reasonable.
40 Table of Contents Capital Markets . Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, conditions of the wireless industry, our financial performance and the state of the capital markets. In April 2004, the SEC declared effective our universal shelf registration statement for possible future offerings of an aggregate of up to $1.0 billion of debt and/or equity securities. As of December31, 2005, we had not conducted any offerings pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to income taxes, purchase price allocation, asset retirement obligations, impairment of assets and revenue recognition. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, beginning on page F-7.
Income Taxes.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. At December31, 2005, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $422.4 million, including approximately $249.5 million attributable to SpectraSite, primarily related to certain net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. Approximately $237.8 million of the SpectraSite valuation allowance was assumed as of the acquisition date. The balance of the valuation allowance primarily relates to net state deferred tax assets. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax carryforward period.
We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003, of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately $90.0 million. Based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities, we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $65.0 million as a result of these claims by the end of 2006. There can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of any refund.
The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax 41 Table of Contents assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.3 billion in taxable income from January1, 2006 to December31, 2025. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense.
From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. During the year ended December31, 2005, we recorded a $29.5 million income tax provision to reflect a reduction in managements estimate of the net realizable value of our pending federal tax refund claims as described above. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December31, 2005.
Depending on the resolution of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in notes 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in Verestar. No income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings.
Purchase Price Allocation.
We account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No.141 Business Combinations (SFAS No.141), which provides that purchase prices be allocated to the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. In the case of tower assets acquired through the purchase of a business, such as our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, and the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as residual goodwill. We completed our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. in August 2005 for a total preliminary purchase price of approximately $3.1 billion, including the fair value of shares of ClassA common stock issued, the fair value of options and warrants assumed and estimated transaction costs. We are in the process of finalizing a third-party valuation of SpectraSites property and equipment, intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities. Given the size of the SpectraSite transaction, the values of certain assets and liabilities are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to adjustment as additional information on managements estimates and assumptions is obtained and the third-party valuation is finalized. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair values of property and equipment, intangibles, restructuring and merger related liabilities, other assumed liabilities, deferred income taxes and residual goodwill of approximately $1.5 billion. Changes to the valuation of these items may result in adjustments to the overall purchase price allocation of these items and the related depreciation and amortization.
Asset Retirement Obligations . We comply with the provisions of SFAS No.143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No.143) and the provisions of FIN No.47. Both pronouncements address the financial accounting and reporting requirements for conditional obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located. Under these accounting principles, we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligations estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
As of December31, 2005, we adopted the provisions of FIN No.47 and recognized a $35.5 million charge (net of an $11.7 million tax benefit) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2005. This adoption also increased our aggregate asset retirement obligation by approximately $114.0 million to $164.2 million as of December31, 2005 and resulted in an increase to tower assets included in property and equipment, net of $66.9 million. The adoption of FIN No.47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of our settlement date assumptions, as FIN No. 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in 42 Table of Contents determining our settlement date assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Companys aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary.
Impairment of Assets.
Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization and Non-Core Long-Lived Assets Held for Sale: We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows, as well as through other analytical methods. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the assets fair market value as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on managements best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss.
GoodwillAssets Not Subject to Amortization: We perform our annual goodwill impairment test on December1 of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. In December 2005, 2004 and 2003, we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired. Fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information, changes to which could affect those fair value estimates. Our December 2005 annual impairment testing included $1.5 billion of goodwill acquired in our merger with SpectraSite, Inc.
Revenue Recognition . Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancelable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the applicable leases. Straight-line revenues for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 approximated $30.3 million, $24.8 million and $22.9 million respectively. Amounts billed up-front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until such time as the earnings process is complete.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R revises SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123), supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB No.25) and amends SFAS No.95, Statement of Cash Flows. This statement addressed the accounting for share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options. Under the new standard, companies will no longer be able to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance 43 Table of Contents with APB No.25. Instead, companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair-value method and recognize the related expense associated with share-based payments in the statement of operations. SFAS 123R is effective for us as of January1, 2006. We have historically accounted for share-based payments to employees under APB No.25s intrinsic value method. As such, we generally have not recognized compensation expense for options granted to employees. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R under the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost for all share-based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of SFAS 123R, and compensation cost for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that are unvested as of the effective date of SFAS 123R is recognized based on SFAS 123. Tax benefits will be recognized related to the cost for share-based payments to the extent the equity instrument would ordinarily result in a future tax deduction under existing law. Tax expense will be recognized to write off excess deferred tax assets when the tax deduction upon settlement of a vested option is less than the expense recorded in the statement of operations (to the extent not offset by prior tax credits for settlements where the tax deduction was greater than the fair value cost). We estimate that we will recognize equity-based compensation expense of approximately $35 million to $38 million for the year ending December31, 2006. This amount is subject to revisions as we finalize certain assumptions related to 2006, including the size and nature of awards and forfeiture rates. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as operating cash flow as was previously required. We cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on, among other factors, future employee stock option exercises. Due to the our tax loss position, there was no operating cash inflow realized for December31, 2005 and 2004 for such excess tax deductions.
In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.107 regarding the Staffs interpretation of SFAS 123R. This interpretation provides the Staffs views regarding interactions between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. The interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of SFAS 123R and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided. We will follow the guidance prescribed in SAB No.107 in connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None.
46 Table of Contents ITEM 9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors.
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods.
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005. As discussed in Item1 of this annual report under the caption Business and in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, we completed our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. in August 2005. As permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC, we excluded SpectraSite from our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005. The total assets and revenues of SpectraSite included in our consolidated financial statements were approximately 14% and 18%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005.
In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework . Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
Deloitte& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an attestation report on managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Such attestation, which expresses unqualified opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is included in this Item9A under the caption Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control performed during the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As set forth above, we excluded SpectraSite from our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting for the quarter and year ended December31, 2005. We consider the merger with SpectraSite material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and we are in the process of integrating the internal control procedures of SpectraSite into our internal control structure.
47 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of American Tower Corporation Boston, Massachusetts We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that American Tower Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from their assessment the internal control over financial reporting at SpectraSite, Inc. which was acquired on August8, 2005 and whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 14% and 18%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2005. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at SpectraSite, Inc. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
48 Table of Contents We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December31, 2005, of the Company and our report dated March14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the Companys adoption of FASB Interpretation No.47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligationsan interpretation of FASB Statement No.143 effective December31, 2005.

OTHER INFORMATION Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities During the period January1, 2006 through March9, 2006, we issued an aggregate of 60,355 shares of our ClassA common stock upon the exercise of 8,466 warrants assumed in our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. In August 2005, in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., we assumed approximately 1.0million warrants to purchase shares of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock. Upon completion of the merger, each warrant to purchase shares of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock automatically converted into a warrant to purchase 7.15 shares of ClassA common stock at an exercise price of $32 per warrant. Net proceeds from these warrant exercises were approximately $266,000. The shares were issued to warrantholders in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Section3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. No underwriters were engaged in connection with such issuances.
During the period January1, 2006 through March9, 2006, we issued an aggregate of 9,659,082 shares of our ClassA common stock upon the exercise of 685,404 warrants. The warrants were originally issued in January 2003 as part of an offering of 808,000 units, each consisting of (1)$1,000 principal amount at maturity of ATI 12.25% Notes and (2)a warrant to purchase 14.0953 shares of our ClassA common stock. The warrants are exercisable on or after January29, 2006 at an exercise price of $0.01 per share and will expire on August1, 2008. As many of these warrants were exercised pursuant to a cashless net exercise pursuant to the warrant agreement, net proceeds from these warrant exercises were approximately $44,000. The shares were issued to warrantholders pursuant to an effective registration statement or in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Section3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. No underwriters were engaged in connection with such issuance.
During the period January1, 2006 through March9, 2006, we issued an aggregate of 1,840,025 shares of our ClassA common stock upon conversion of $22.5 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, the holders of the 3.25% Notes received 81.808 shares of ClassA common stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. The shares were issued to the noteholders in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Section3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. No underwriters were engaged in connection with such issuances. In connection with the conversion, we paid such holders an aggregate of $1.7 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes.

F-6 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business American Tower Corporation and subsidiaries (collectively, ATC or the Company), is an independent owner, operator and developer of wireless and broadcast communications sites in the United States, Mexico and Brazil. The Companys primary business, as discussed in note 16, is the leasing of antenna space on multi-tenant communications towers to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies. The Company also operates distributed antenna systems within buildings and provides limited network development services that support its rental and management operations and the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. During 2004 and 2003, the Company sold or committed to sell certain non-core businesses, which have been reported as discontinued operations. (See note 3.) The Company completed its merger with SpectraSite, Inc. in August2005, as more fully described in note 2. The merger was approved by the stockholders of the Company and SpectraSite, Inc. on August3, 2005, and the results of operations of SpectraSite have been included in the Companys accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December31, 2005, commencing on August3, 2005.
ATC is a holding company which conducts its operations in the United States, Mexico and Brazil through operating subsidiaries. ATCs principal United States operating subsidiaries are American Towers, Inc. (ATI) and SpectraSite Communications, Inc. (SpectraSite). ATCs principal international operating subsidiary is American Tower International, Inc., which conducts operations in Mexico through its subsidiary ATC Mexico Holding Corp. (ATC Mexico) and in Brazil through its subsidiary ATC South America Holding Corp. (ATC South America).
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company consolidates those entities in which it owns greater than fifty percent of the entitys voting stock, with the exception of Verestar, Inc. (Verestar), as discussed in note 3.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition, impairment of long-lived assets (including goodwill), purchase price allocation, asset retirement obligations and valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets.
Revenue Recognition Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned. Fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancelable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with the Companys customers are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the applicable leases. Straight-line revenues for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 approximated $30,304,000, $24,762,000 and $22,944,000, respectively. Amounts billed up-front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the initial terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until such time as the earnings process is complete.
Network development services revenues are derived under contracts or arrangements with customers that provide for billings on a fixed price basis. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, excluding certain fees for F-7 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements which are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the initial terms of the applicable leases.
Rent Expense Many of the leases underlying the Companys tower sites have fixed rent escalators, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable by the Company over time. The Company calculates straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the term of the underlying ground lease, the applicable towers useful life, and the term of the tenant lease on the applicable tower. Typically, the Company enters into tenant leases, which contain multiple renewal options, with its customers for antenna space on its towers. Certain of these tenant leases require the Company to exercise all available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease, if the tenant exercises its renewal option. For towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease, the Company calculates its straight-line ground rent over the lesser of the remaining ground lease life (including all renewal options) or the life of the tenant lease (including all renewal options). In instances where the Companys tenant leases do not require the Company to exercise all available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease, the Company calculates its straight-line ground rent over the lesser of the ground lease life (including all renewal options) or a period equal to or greater than the 15-year period over which the Company depreciates its tower assets.
Straight-line ground rent expense approximated $15,946,000, $12,101,000 and $14,687,000, for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Companys straight-line rent liability of approximately $97.1 million and $81.2 million is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Corporate General, Administrative and Development Expense Corporate general and administrative expense consists of corporate overhead costs not specifically allocable to any of the Companys individual business segments. Development expense consists of uncapitalized acquisition costs, costs to integrate acquisitions, costs associated with new business initiatives and abandoned acquisition costs.
Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations Loss on retirement of long-term obligations primarily includes cash paid to retire debt in excess of its carrying value and non-cash charges related to the write-off of deferred financing fees. In addition, it also includes non-cash charges related to the fair value of incremental stock issued to induce convertible noteholders to convert their holdings prior to the scheduled redemption date. Such amounts are expensed as incurred in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No.84 Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt. Loss on retirement of long-term obligations also includes gains from repurchasing or refinancing certain of the Companys debt obligations. (See note 7.) Discount and Premium on Notes The Company amortizes the discount on its convertible, senior and senior subordinated discount notes (including the allocated fair value of the related warrants) and the premium on its senior notes, using the effective interest method over the term of the obligation. Such amortization is recorded as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. (See note 7.) Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, notes receivable, trade receivables and derivative instruments. The Company mitigates its risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents and derivative instruments by maintaining its deposits and contracts at high quality financial institutions and monitoring the credit ratings of those institutions. The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of customers in the telecommunications industry, and over 50% of its revenues are derived from five customers in the industry. In addition, the Company has concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. (See notes 6, 8 and 16.) F-8 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of its borrowers and customers. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances of $15,071,000, $13,968,000 and $17,445,000 as of December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Amounts charged against allowances, net of recoveries, for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 approximated $13,083,000, $20,917,000, and $20,536,000, respectively. The fair value of accounts receivable acquired in the merger with SpectraSite, Inc. increased the allowances by approximately $5,694,000 as of the date of acquisition in August 2005.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. All derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings (loss). Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs.
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk relating to variable interest rates on its new credit facilities described in note 7. During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, as part of its overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of interest rate fluctuations under its variable rate credit facilities, the Company used interest rate swaps and caps. As of December31, 2005, the Company had derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of floating interest rate payments on the Companys credit facilities. The interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the interest payments for a portion of the debt from floating rate to fixed rate debt.
The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes. (See note 8.) Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America are included in other comprehensive income (loss), but are excluded from net income (loss), as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders equity, net of tax. The Companys other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of unrealized gains/losses on derivative cash flow hedges.
Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys foreign subsidiaries in Mexico and Brazil is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities related to the Companys Mexican and Brazilian operations are remeasured from the local currency into U.S. dollars at the rate of currency exchange at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are remeasured at average monthly exchange rates. All remeasurement gains and losses are included in the Companys consolidated statement of operations, within the caption other income (expense). The net remeasurement gain (loss) for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 approximated $396,000, $(146,000), and $(1,142,000), respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments with remaining maturities (when purchased) of three months or less.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost or at estimated fair value (in the case of acquired properties). Cost for self-constructed towers includes direct materials and labor, indirect costs F-9 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) associated with construction and capitalized interest. Approximately $473,000, $226,000, and $672,000 of interest was capitalized for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives. Property and equipment acquired through capital leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Towers on leased land are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the ground lease (including renewal options) or the estimated useful life of the tower (15 years). Asset useful lives are as follows: Equipment 3-15 years Buildings 32 years Building and land improvements 15-32 years Towers upto15years For towers acquired through capital lease, the Company records the entire purchase price as a capital lease, and reflects that value in property and equipment. Property and equipment, network/location intangibles and assets held under capital lease related to tower acquisitions are amortized over their useful lives for a period up to fifteen years.Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Betterments and improvements that extend an assets useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company complies with the provisions of SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No.142) which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, in accordance with SFAS No.142. Intangible assets that are deemed to have a definite life continue to be amortized over their useful lives. (See note 5.) Income Taxes The consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company provides valuation allowances if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. (See note 13.) Sales of Subsidiary Stock The Company complies with the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.51, Accounting for Sales of Stock by a Subsidiary and records the difference between the Companys carrying value of the interest in the subsidiarys equity that was sold and the proceeds received for that interest to additional paid-in-capital. The Company records any gains or losses resulting from the sale of stock by a subsidiary as a component of stockholders equity. (See note 11.) Treasury Stock The Company records treasury stock purchases under the cost method, whereby the purchase price, including legal costs and commissions, is recorded in a contra equity account (treasury stock). The equity accounts from which the shares were originally issued are not adjusted for any treasury stock purchases. (See notes 14 and 18.) Loss per Common Share Basic and diluted net loss per common share has been computed by dividing the Companys net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For the F-10 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, potential common shares, including shares issuable upon exercise of options and warrants and upon conversion of the Companys convertible notes, have been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per common share, as their effect is anti-dilutive. Potential common shares excluded from the calculation of net loss per share were approximately 72.9 million, 68.8million, and 65.6million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-Lived Asset and Discontinued Operations The Company reviews long-lived assets, including intangibles with definite lives, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or the Companys review of its tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Companys tower portfolio review includes sites for which the Company has no current tenant leases. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered, either through projected undiscounted future cash flows (with respect to operating assets), or anticipated proceeds from sales (with respect to non-core assets that are designated for sale or towers that have no current tenant leases). If the Company determines that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, it measures any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or the estimated sale proceeds, as compared to the assets carrying value. The Company also complies with the provisions of SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, (SFAS No.144) regarding impairment assessments and decisions concerning discontinued operations. The Company records impairment losses in the period in which it identifies such impairments. (See notes 3 and 12.) Notes Receivable and Other Long-Term Assets Other long-term assets primarily represent the Companys notes receivable described in note 6, the straight-line asset associated with non-cancelable tenant leases that contain fixed escalation clauses over the terms of the applicable leases, as well as investments, prepaid ground lease assets, long-term deposits, favorable leasehold interests and other long-term assets acquired in connection with the merger with SpectraSite, Inc. The Companys straight-line asset was approximately $152.1 million and $121.9 million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Investments in those entities where the Company owns less than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity and does not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity are accounted for using the cost method. Investments in entities where the Company owns less than twenty percent but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity, or where the Company owns more than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity, but not in excess of fifty percent, are accounted for using the equity method. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the Companys investments were in companies that are not publicly traded, and, therefore, no established market for their securities exists. The Company has a policy in place to review the fair value of its investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies. If the Company believes that the carrying value of an investment is in excess of fair market value, the Company records an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value to fair market value. The Companys only investment, with a carrying value of $10.1 million and $10.2 million as of December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, was accounted for as a cost investment as of December31, 2005 and as an equity investment as of December31, 2004.
During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded losses on equity method investments of approximately $2.1 million, $2.9 million, and $1.9 million, respectively. During the year ended December31, 2003, the Company recorded impairment charges on its cost and equity investments of approximately $19.3 million. Losses on equity method investments are recorded in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No.99-10 Percentage Used to Determine the Amount of Equity Method Losses.
Asset Retirement Obligations The Company complies with the provisions of SFAS No.143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No.143) and the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN No.47). Both F-11 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) pronouncements address the financial accounting and reporting requirements for conditional obligations associated with the Companys legal obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets and the related asset retirement costs.
The fair value of a liability for asset retirement obligations is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and can be reasonably estimated. Such asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the assets estimated useful life. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The Company has certain legal obligations related to tower assets which fall within the scope of SFAS No.143 and FIN No.47, principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of the Companys tower assets are located. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Companys aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate the Companys incremental borrowing rate. The adoption of FIN No.47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of settlement date assumptions, as FIN No.47 precludes the Company from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining its settlement date assumptions.
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.143 as of January1, 2003 and the provisions of FIN No.47 as of December31, 2005. Upon adoption of the provisions of FIN No.47, the Company recognized a $35.5 million charge (net of an $11.7 million tax benefit) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2005. In addition, the adoption of FIN No.47 resulted in an increase to the tower assets included in property and equipment, net of $66.9 million. Had the Company adopted the provisions of FIN No.47 as of January1, 2003, the aggregate asset retirement obligation as of January1, 2003,December31, 2003 and December31, 2004 would have approximated $86.7 million, $92.9 million and $99.5 million, respectively. Had the Company adopted the provisions of FIN No. 47 in prior periods, net loss for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 would have been approximately $(332,398) and $(253,627), respectively and basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004 would have been approximately $(1.60) and $(1.13), respectively.
The Companys asset retirement obligation is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The changes in the carrying value of the Companys asset retirement obligations for years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Beginning balance as of January1, $ 23,464 $ 4,635 $ 1,250 Additions and revisions in estimated cash flows, net of settlements 2,587 17,016 3,223 Accretion expense 3,069 1,813 162 Liability assumed in merger with SpectraSite, Inc.
21,126 Increase due to change in accounting principle 113,976 Balance as of December31, $ 164,222 $ 23,464 $ 4,635 Stock-Based Compensation The Company complies with the provisions of SFAS No.148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of SFAS No.123, which provides optional transition guidance for those companies electing to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of SFAS No.123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123). The Company continues to use Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25 (APB No.25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, to account for equity grants and awards to employees, officers and directors and has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of F-12 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) SFAS No.148. In accordance with APB No.25, the Company recognizes compensation expense based on the excess, if any, of the quoted stock price at the grant date of the award or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The Companys stock option plans are more fully described in note 14. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), as further described below.
During the year ended December31, 2005, the Company reevaluated the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees. As a result, the Company lowered its expected volatility assumption for options granted after July1, 2005 to approximately 30% and increased the expected life of option grants to 6.25 years using the simplified method permitted by SEC SAB No.107,Share-Based Payment (SAB No.107). The Company made this change based on a number of factors, including the Companys execution of its strategic plans to sell non-core businesses, reduce leverage and refinance its debt, and its recent merger with SpectraSite, Inc. (See note 2.) Management had previously based its volatility assumptions on historical volatility since inception, which included periods when the Companys capital structure was more highly leveraged than current levels and expected levels for the foreseeable future.Managements estimate of future volatility is based on its consideration of all available information, including historical volatility, implied volatility of publicly traded options, the Companys current capital structure and its publicly announced future business plans.For comparative purposes, a 10% change in the volatility assumption would change pro forma stock option expense and pro forma net loss by approximately $0.1 million for the year ended December31, 2005. (See note 14.) The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per common share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123 (as amended) to stock-based compensation. The estimated fair value of each option is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (in thousands, except per share amounts): 2005 2004 2003 Net loss as reported $ (171,590 ) $ (247,587 ) $ (325,321 ) Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense, net of related tax effect, included in net loss as reported 7,104 2,297 2,077 Less: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax effect (22,238 ) (23,906 ) (31,156 ) Pro-forma net loss $ (186,724 ) $ (269,196 ) $ (354,400 ) Basic and diluted net loss per share as reported $ (0.57 ) $ (1.10 ) $ (1.56 ) Basic and diluted net loss per share pro-forma $ (0.62 ) $ (1.20 ) $ (1.70 ) The Company has modified certain option awards to revise vesting and exercise terms for certain terminated employees and recognized charges of $7.0 million, $3.0 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition, the stock-based employee compensation amounts above for the year ended December31, 2005, include approximately $2.4 million of unearned compensation amortization related to unvested stock options assumed in the merger with SpectraSite, Inc. Such charges are reflected in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense with corresponding adjustments to additional paid-in capital and unearned compensation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R, which supersedes APB No.25, and amends SFAS No.95, Statement of Cash Flows. This statement addressed the accounting for share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options. Under the new standard, F-13 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) companies will no longer be able to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with APB No.25. Instead, companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair-value method and recognize the related expense associated with share-based payments in the statement of operations. SFAS 123R, is effective for the Company as of January1, 2006. The Company historically accounted for share-based payments to employees under APB No.25s intrinsic value method. As such, the Company generally has not recognized compensation expense for options granted to employees. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R under the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost for all share-based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of SFAS 123R, and compensation cost for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that are unvested as of the effective date of SFAS 123R is recognized based on SFAS 123. Tax benefits will be recognized related to the cost for share-based payments to the extent the equity instrument would ordinarily result in a future tax deduction under existing law. Tax expense will be recognized to write off excess deferred tax assets when the tax deduction upon settlement of a vested option is less than the expense recorded in the statement of operations (to the extent not offset by prior tax credits for settlements where the tax deduction was greater than the fair value cost). The Company estimates that it will recognize equity-based compensation expense of approximately $35 million to $38 million for the year ending December31, 2006. This amount is subject to revisions as the Company finalizes certain assumptions related to 2006, including the size and nature of share-based awards and forfeiture rates. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as operating cash flow as was previously required. The Company cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on, among other factors, future employee stock option exercises. Due to the Companys tax loss position, there was no operating cash inflow realized for December31, 2005 and 2004 for such excess tax deductions.
In March 2005, the SEC issued SAB No.107 regarding the Staffs interpretation of SFAS 123R. This interpretation provides the Staffs views regarding interactions between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. The interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of SFAS 123R and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided. The Company will follow the guidance prescribed in SAB No.107 in connection with its adoption of SFAS 123R.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of the Companys financial instruments, with the exception of long-term obligations, including current portion, reasonably approximate the related fair values as of December31, 2005 and 2004. As of December31, 2005, the carrying amount and fair value of long-term obligations, including current portion, were $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. As of December31, 2004, the carrying amount and fair value of long-term obligations, including current portion, were $3.3 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. Fair values are based primarily on quoted market prices for those or similar instruments.
Retirement Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain age and employment requirements. Under the plan, the Companys matching contribution for periods prior to June30, 2004 was 35% up to a maximum 5% of a participants contributions. Effective July1, 2004, the plan was amended to increase the Company match to 50% up to a maximum 6% of a participants contributions. The Company contributed approximately $1,061,000, $533,000 and $825,000 to the plan for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the accompanying 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial statements and related notes to conform to the 2005 presentation. The Company changed the classification of its changes in restricted cash and investment balances to present such changes as an investing activity in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December31, 2004. The F-14 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Company had previously presented such changes as a financing activity. The change in classification resulted in an increase of $170.0 million in investing cash flows and a corresponding decrease in financing cash flows from the amounts previously reported.
2.ACQUISITIONS General The acquisitions consummated by the Company during 2005, 2004 and 2003, have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No.141 Business Combinations (SFAS No.141). The purchase prices have been allocated to the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, as further discussed below.
During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company primarily acquired its tower assets from third parties in one of two types of transactions: the purchase of a business or the purchase of assets. The structure of each transaction affects the way the Company allocates purchase price within the consolidated financial statements. In the case of tower assets acquired through the purchase of a business, the Company allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. In the case of an asset purchase, the Company first allocates the purchase price to property and equipment for the appraised value of the tower and to identifiable intangible assets (primarily customer base). The Company then records any remaining purchase price within intangible assets as a network/location intangible.
The Companys accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect preliminary allocations of purchase price for certain of its acquisitions, as appraisals of the net assets acquired have not been finalized. The Company does not expect any changes in depreciation and amortization from the finalization of these appraisals to be material to its consolidated results of operations.
Merger with SpectraSite, Inc.
In May 2005, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with SpectraSite, Inc., an owner and operator of approximately 7,800 wireless and broadcast towers and in-building systems in the United States. The Company completed the merger in August 2005, which increased the size of the Companys communications site portfolio to over 22,000 sites.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, SpectraSite, Inc. merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and each share of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock converted into the right to receive 3.575 shares of the Companys ClassA common stock. In August 2005, the Company issued approximately 169.5million shares of its ClassA common stock with respect to shares of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock outstanding as of the closing of the merger and reserved for issuance approximately 9.9million and 6.8million shares of ClassA common stock issuable pursuant to SpectraSite, Inc. options and warrants, respectively, assumed in the merger.
The total preliminary purchase price of approximately $3.1 billion includes the fair value of shares of ClassA common stock issued, the fair value of SpectraSite, Inc. options and warrants assumed, and estimated transaction costs, as follows (in thousands): Total Issuance of American Tower ClassA common stock to stockholders of SpectraSite, Inc. (169.5 million shares at $17.21) $ 2,917,130 Fair value of options assumed, net of estimated tax benefit 88,487 Fair value of warrants assumed 100,455 Estimated transaction costs 22,733 Total preliminary purchase price $ 3,128,805 F-15 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The fair value of shares of ClassA common stock issued and options and warrants assumed was determined using a value of $17.21 per share, which represents the average closing price of the ClassA common stock from the two trading days before, to the two trading days after, the signing of the merger agreement and the public announcement of the merger. The fair value of the SpectraSite, Inc. options and warrants assumed was calculated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Upon completion of the merger, the assumed SpectraSite, Inc. stock options were exercisable for an aggregate of 9.9million shares of the Companys ClassA common stock. Of these options, options to purchase approximately 8.3million shares were fully vested as of the closing date and the remaining unvested options to purchase 1.6million shares vest monthly through the first quarter of 2008. The portion of the intrinsic value of the unvested options related to future service has been allocated to unearned compensation of $4.9 million and is being amortized over the remaining vesting periods, which range from approximately one to three years from the date of acquisition. Approximately $2.4 million was amortized to merger related expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December31, 2005. The purchase price and residual goodwill has also been adjusted to reflect an estimated tax benefit of $35.1 million associated with the post merger exercises of options assumed in the merger. Transaction costs include investment banking, legal and accounting fees and other external costs directly related to the merger.
The Company is in the process of finalizing a third-party valuation of SpectraSites property and equipment, intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities. Given the size of the SpectraSite transaction, the values of certain assets and liabilities are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained and the third-party valuation is finalized. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation which are not yet finalized relate to the fair values of property and equipment, intangibles, restructuring and merger related liabilities, other assumed liabilities, deferred income taxes and residual goodwill. Changes to the valuation of these items may result in adjustments to depreciation and amortization and associated income taxes. Goodwill resulting from the merger was assigned to the Companys rental and management segment. Deferred taxes were recorded for the differing book and tax bases of all SpectraSite assets and liabilities other than goodwill.
The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and related deferred income taxes in connection with the merger (in thousands): Assets acquired: Current assets $ 69,844 Property and equipment 1,314,547 Intangible assets subject to amortization: Acquired customer base and network location intangible 1,215,000 Other intangibles 17,300 Total intangible assets 1,232,300 Goodwill 1,549,868 Other long-term assets 36,255 Deferred income taxes 24,334 Total assets acquired $ 4,227,148 F-16 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Liabilities assumed: Current liabilities $ 120,525 Long-term debt, including current portion 702,480 Other long-term liabilities 60,489 Deferred income taxes 219,710 Total liabilities assumed $ 1,103,204 Other: Unearned compensation on unvested options 4,861 Net assets acquired $ 3,128,805 Other Acquisitions During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company used cash to acquire a total of 30 towers, 214 towers and 561 towers for approximately $6.0 million, $33.4 million and $95.1 million, respectively, primarily in Mexico and Brazil under agreements with NII Holdings, Inc. and Iusacell Celular.

Pursuant to this transaction, the Company recorded a net loss on disposal of approximately $1.7 million, which is reflected in loss from discontinued operations, net, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2004.
Kline, Iron& Steel In June 2003, the Company committed to a plan to sell its steel fabrication and tall tower construction service subsidiary, Kline (previously included in the Companys network development services segment). During 2003, the Company recognized an aggregate non-cash charge of approximately $14.6 million (including $10.3 million of goodwill) related to the impairment of Klines net assets to reduce their carrying value to the estimated proceeds expected upon disposal. This charge is reflected in loss from discontinued operations, net, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2003.

Verestar In December 2002, the Company committed to a plan to sell Verestar by December31, 2003. In December 2003, Verestar filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. Under generally accepted accounting principles, consolidation is generally required for investments of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of an investee, except when control is not held by the majority owner. Under these rules, legal reorganization or bankruptcy represent conditions which can preclude consolidation in instances where control rests with the bankruptcy court, rather than the majority owner. Accordingly, due to the bankruptcy filing, the Company ceased to consolidate Verestars financial results beginning December22, 2003. The operations of Verestar are included in loss from discontinued operations, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations through the date of the bankruptcy filing. As described in note 9, the Company has incurred costs in connection with its involvement in the bankruptcy proceedings of Verestar, which are reflected within discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
The Company recognized aggregate impairment charges related to its investment in Verestar of approximately $26.5 million for the year ended December31, 2003. These charges reduced the carrying value of the Companys investment in Verestar to zero as of December31, 2003. These charges are included in loss from discontinued F-18 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) operations, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December31, 2003.

The increase in the carrying value was as a result of the goodwill of $1.5 billion acquired in the merger with SpectraSite, Inc. (See note 2.) F-19 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Company has selected December1 as the date to perform its annual impairment test. In performing its 2005 and 2004 testing, the Company completed an internal appraisal and estimated the fair value of the rental and management reporting unit that contains goodwill utilizing future discounted cash flows and market information. Based on the appraisals performed, the Company determined that goodwill in its rental and management segment was not impaired.
The Companys other intangible assets subject to amortization consist of the following as of December31, (in thousands): 2005 2004 Acquired customer base and network location intangibles $ 2,606,546 $ 1,369,607 Deferred financing costs 65,623 89,736 Acquired licenses and other intangibles 51,703 43,404 Total 2,723,872 1,502,747 Less accumulated amortization (646,560 ) (517,444 ) Other intangible assets, net $ 2,077,312 $ 985,303 The Company amortizes its intangible assets over periods ranging from three to fifteen years. Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 aggregated approximately $136.0 million and $97.8 million, respectively (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs, which is included in interest expense). The Company expects to record amortization expense of approximately $183.6 million, $178.3 million, $174.4 million, $172.7 million and $170.3 million, for the years ended December31, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. These amounts are subject to changes in estimates until the preliminary allocation of the SpectraSite purchase price is finalized.
6.NOTES RECEIVABLE In 2000, the Company loaned TV Azteca, S.A. de C.V. (TV Azteca), the owner of a major national television network in Mexico, $119.8 million. The loan, which initially bore interest at 12.87%, payable quarterly, was discounted by the Company, as the fair value interest rate at the date of the loan was determined to be 14.25%. The loan was amended effective January1, 2003 to increase the original interest rate to 13.11%. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, approximately $119.8 million undiscounted ($108.2 million discounted) under the loan was outstanding and included in notes receivable and other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The term of the loan is seventy years; however, the loan may be prepaid by TV Azteca without penalty during the last fifty years of the agreement. The discount on the loan is being amortized to interest incomeTV Azteca, net, using the effective interest method over the seventy-year term of the loan.
Simultaneous with the signing of the loan agreement, the Company also entered into a seventy year Economic Rights Agreement with TV Azteca regarding space not used by TV Azteca on approximately 190 of its broadcast towers. In exchange for the issuance of the below market interest rate loan discussed above and the annual payment of $1.5 million to TV Azteca (under the Economic Rights Agreement), the Company has the right to market and lease the unused tower space on the broadcast towers (the Economic Rights). TV Azteca retains title to these towers and is responsible for their operation and maintenance. The Company is entitled to 100% of the revenues generated from leases with tenants on the unused space and is responsible for any incremental operating expenses associated with those tenants.
F-20 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The term of the Economic Rights Agreement is seventy years; however, TV Azteca has the right to purchase, at fair market value, the Economic Rights from the Company at any time during the last fifty years of the agreement. Should TV Azteca elect to purchase the Economic Rights (in whole or in part), it would also be obligated to repay a proportional amount of the loan discussed above at the time of such election. The Companys obligation to pay TV Azteca $1.5 million annually would also be reduced proportionally.
The Company has accounted for the annual payment of $1.5 million as a capital lease (initially recording an asset and a corresponding liability of approximately $18.6 million). The capital lease asset and the discount on the note, which aggregate approximately $30.2 million, represent the cost to acquire the Economic Rights and are being amortized over the seventy-year life of the Economic Rights agreement.
On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses the recoverability of its note receivable from TV Azteca. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company has assessed the recoverability of the note receivable from TV Azteca and concluded that no adjustment to its carrying value is required.
An executive officer and former director of the Company served as a director of TV Azteca from December 1999 to February 2006.
As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company also had other long-term notes receivable outstanding of approximately $11.1 million and $11.2 million, respectively.

F-21 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) As of December31, 2005, the new American Tower credit facility consists of the following:  a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, against which approximately $18.2 million of undrawn letters of credit are outstanding at December31, 2005, maturing on October27, 2010;  a $750.0 million Term Loan A, which is fully drawn, maturing on October27, 2010; and  a $250.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan, of which $43.0 million was drawn at December31, 2005, maturing on October27, 2010.
The borrowers under the American Tower credit facility include ATI, American Tower, L.P., American Tower International, Inc. and American Tower LLC. The Company and the borrowers restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the loan agreement) have guaranteed all of the loans under the credit facility. These loans are secured by liens on and security interests in substantially all assets of the borrowers and the restricted subsidiaries, with a carrying value aggregating approximately $4.0 billion at December 31, 2005. At closing, the Company drew down the entire Term Loan A of the American Tower credit facility and used the net proceeds to repay principal and interest on the $745.0 million outstanding under the previous American Tower credit facility.
In December 2005, the Company drew down $43.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan to finance repurchases of ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes due 2008 (ATI 12.25% Notes). As of December31, 2005, the Company had $793.0million outstanding under the new American Tower credit facility. Under the terms of the new American Tower credit facility, the Company could borrow approximately $488.8 million while remaining in compliance with the applicable covenants as of December31, 2005.
As of December31, 2005, the new SpectraSite credit facility consists of the following:  a $250.0 million revolving credit facility, against which approximately $4.6 million of undrawn letters of credit were outstanding at December31, 2005, maturing on October27, 2010;  a $700.0 million Term Loan A, which is fully drawn, maturing on October27, 2010; and  a $200.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan, none of which was drawn at December31, 2005, maturing on October27, 2010.
The borrower under the SpectraSite credit facility is SpectraSite Communications. SpectraSite Communications, its parent company (SpectraSite, LLC), and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the loan agreement) have guaranteed all of the loans under the credit facility. These loans are secured by liens on and security interests in substantially all assets of the borrower and the restricted subsidiaries, with a carrying value aggregating approximately $4.0 billion at December 31, 2005. At closing, the Company drew down the entire Term Loan A of the SpectraSite credit facility and used the net proceeds to repay principal and interest on the $697.0 million principal amount outstanding under the previous SpectraSite credit facility.
As of December31, 2005, the Company had $700.0million outstanding under the new SpectraSite credit facility. Under the terms of the new SpectraSite credit facility, the Company could borrow approximately $445.4million while remaining in compliance with the applicable covenants as of December31, 2005.
The revolving credit facility and Delayed Draw Term Loan components of each of the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities remained undrawn at closing. Each credit facility provides that any portion of the F-22 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Delayed Draw Term Loan component that is not drawn as of October27, 2006 will be canceled. As of December31, 2005, the Company had drawn $43.0 million of the Delayed Draw Tem Loan under the American Tower credit facility. Interest rates for the revolving loan and the term loan components of each of the credit facilities are determined at the option of the borrowers under the facility and range between 0.50% and 1.25% above the LIBOR rate for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.0% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on the applicable borrowers debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each credit facility is required, ranging from 0.10% to 0.375%per annum, based on the applicable borrowers debt ratings.
The American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries must comply. Each credit facility contains the following two financial maintenance tests with which the borrowers under the applicable credit facility must comply:  a leverage ratio (Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 5.50 to 1.00 for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries; and  an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00 for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries.
Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the American Tower credit facility or the SpectraSite credit facility would not only prevent the Company from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving loans, but would constitute a default, resulting in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with all of the foregoing tests.
Each credit facility has a term of five years and matures on October27, 2010. All amounts will be due and payable in full at maturity. The credit facilities do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the borrowers option without penalty or premium. The new credit facilities allow the Company to use borrowings for general corporate purposes and, provided certain conditions are met, permit the use of borrowings under the credit facilities and internally generated funds to repurchase the Companys equity securities and repurchase and refinance other indebtedness without additional lender approval.
Previous American Tower Credit Facilities In each of 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company amended its previous American Tower Credit facilities. The Company amended its credit facility in 2003 (2003 Credit Facility), refinanced the 2003 Credit Facility with a new credit facility in 2004 (2004 Credit Facility), and amended the 2004 Credit Facility in 2005. As discussed above, the 2004 Credit Facility was terminated and repaid in October 2005 in connection with the implementation of the Companys new American Tower credit facility.
In May 2005, the Company amended its 2004 Credit Facility to replace the $397.0 million Term Loan B due August31, 2011 with a new $397.0 million Term Loan C due August31, 2011. The new Term Loan C had substantially the same terms as the previous Term Loan B, except that the interest rate spreads for the existing LIBOR and base rate loans were reduced.
In May 2004, the Company refinanced its 2003 Credit Facility and replaced it with the 2004 Credit Facility, a $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility. At closing, the Company received $685.5 million of net proceeds from the borrowings under the 2004 Credit Facility, after deducting related expenses and fees. Approximately $670.0 million of the net proceeds were used to repay principal and interest on the 2003 Credit Facility. The Company used the remaining net proceeds of $15.5 million for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of other outstanding debt securities. The Company recorded a charge of $11.7 million related to the write-off of F-23 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) deferred financing fees associated with the 2003 Credit Facility, which is reflected in loss on retirement of long-term obligations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2004.
In January 2004, the Company amended its 2003 Credit Facility primarily to facilitate the 7.50% senior notes offering described below. The amendment permitted the Company, among other things, to complete the offering provided that the net proceeds were used to prepay obligations under its convertible notes. The Company also refinanced its $267.0 million Term Loan B under its 2003 Credit Facility with a new Term Loan C due December31, 2007. The new Term Loan C had substantially the same terms as the previous Term Loan B, except that the interest rate spreads for the LIBOR and base rate loans were reduced from 3.5% above LIBOR to 2.25% and from 2.5% above the base rate to 1.25%, respectively. The amendment also removed the requirement that any remaining proceeds from the August 2003 equity offering held as restricted cash and investments on August4, 2004 be contributed to the borrower subsidiaries.
During 2003, the Company reduced the borrowing capacity under its 2003 Credit Facility through certain amendments and related prepayments of $938.8 million and principal payments of $61.5 million. In connection with the amendments during 2003, the Company recorded non-cash charges related to the write-off of deferred financing fees associated with the reduction in the borrowing capacity under the 2003 Credit Facility of approximately $11.9 million. These charges are reflected in loss on retirement of long-term obligations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2003.
For the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003 the combined weighted average interest rate related to the Companys previous American Tower credit facilities was 4.35%, and 3.85% respectively. Commitment fees incurred by the Company related to the previous American Tower credit facilities aggregated approximately $2,761,000, and $2,376,000 for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The indenture for the 7.50% Notes contains certain covenants that restrict the Companys ability to incur more debt; guarantee indebtedness; issue preferred stock; pay dividends; make certain investments; merge, consolidate or sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; and enter into sale leaseback transactions. The 7.50% Notes rank equally with the Companys convertible notes and the 7.125% Notes and are structurally and effectively junior to indebtedness outstanding under the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities and the ATI 7.25% Notes.
As of December31, 2005 and 2004 respectively, the Company had a total of $225.0 million outstanding under the 7.50% Notes.
3.00% Convertible Notes In August 2004, the Company sold $345.0 million principal amount of 3.00% convertible notes due August15, 2012 (3.00% Notes) through an institutional private placement. The net proceeds were approximately $335.9 million, after deducting the commissions payable to the initial purchaser and other expenses related to the offering. The net proceeds were used to redeem a portion of the 9 3 / 8 % Notes, as described below.
The 3.00% Notes mature on August15, 2012, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February15 and August15 of each year. The 3.00% Notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity, subject to their prior redemption or repurchase, into shares of the Companys ClassA common stock at a conversion price of approximately $20.50 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. Upon a fundamental change of control as defined in the notes indenture, the holders of the 3.00% Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or part of the 3.00% Notes for a cash purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount. In addition, upon a fundamental change of control, the holders may elect to convert their notes based on a conversion rate adjustment that entitles the holders to receive additional shares of the Companys ClassA common stock upon conversion depending on the terms and timing of the change of control. The Company may redeem the 3.00% notes after August20, 2009 at an initial redemption price of 101.125% of the principal amount, subject to a ratable decline after August15 of the following year to 100% of the principal amount in 2012.

F-25 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) In certain instances upon a fundamental change of control, the holders of the 3.00% Notes may elect to convert their notes based on a conversion rate adjustment and receive additional shares of the Companys ClassA common stock, the acquirers common stock or, at the election of the acquirer, in certain instances, such feature may be settled in cash. This feature qualifies as an embedded derivative under SFAS No.133. In addition, the Companys 7.125% Notes contain a call provision that also represents an embedded derivative. The Company has recorded the fair value of these provisions, $1.3 million, as a discount under the 3.00% Notes and 7.125% Notes and as a liability in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying December31, 2005 and 2004 consolidated balance sheet, respectively. The Company will record any changes in fair value to the liability in future periods to other expense and will amortize the discount to interest expense within its consolidated statement of operations.
As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the outstanding debt under the 3.00% Notes was $344.4 million and $344.3 million ($345.0 million principal amount), net of $0.6 million and $0.7 million discount, respectively.

The indenture governing the ATI 7.25% Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the Companys ability to incur more debt, pay dividends and make certain investments. The ATI 7.25% Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Company and substantially all of the wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of ATI and the Company, other than SpectraSite and its subsidiaries. The notes rank junior in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of ATI, the sister guarantors (as defined in the indenture relating to the notes) and their domestic subsidiaries, including all indebtedness outstanding under the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities. The ATI 7.25% Notes are structurally senior in right of payment to all other existing and future indebtedness of the Company, including the Companys convertible notes and senior notes.

Net proceeds from the offering aggregated approximately $397.0 million (after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and other expenses related to the offering) and were primarily used to prepay $200.0 million of term loans under the 2003 Credit Facility and to repurchase other outstanding debt.
The gross offering proceeds of approximately $420.0 million were allocated between the ATI 12.25% Notes ($367.4 million) and the warrants ($52.6 million) based on their respective fair values. The value ascribed to the warrants is reflected as a discount to the ATI 12.25% Notes in the accompanying balance sheets and is being accreted to interest expense utilizing the effective interest method over the applicable term.
The Company was permitted to redeem the ATI 12.25% Notes on or after February1, 2006, and the Company redeemed all outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes on February1, 2006, as discussed below. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding. (See note 18.) The ATI 12.25% Notes accrued no cash interest. Instead, the accreted value of each ATI 12.25% Note increased between the date of original issuance and maturity (August 1, 2008) at a rate of 12.25%per annum. The effective interest rate on the ATI 12.25% Notes (after giving effect to the accretion of the original discount and the accretion of the warrants) was 14.7%per annum.

The indenture governing the ATI 12.25% Notes contained certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the Companys ability to incur more debt, pay dividends and make certain investments. The Companys payment obligations under the ATI 12.25% Notes were fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the Company and substantially all of the wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of ATI and the Company, other than SpectraSite and its subsidiaries. The ATI 12.25% Notes ranked junior in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of ATI, the sister guarantors (as defined in the indenture relating to the notes) and their domestic subsidiaries, including all indebtedness outstanding under the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities, and were pari passu with the ATI 7.25% Notes. The ATI 12.25% Notes were structurally senior in right of payment to all other existing and future indebtedness of the Company, including the Companys convertible notes and senior notes.
As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the outstanding debt under the ATI 12.25% Notes was $227.7 million face amount ($160.3 million accreted value, net of $7.2 million fair value allocated to warrants), and $498.2 million face amount ($303.8 million accreted value, net of $21.6 million fair value allocated to warrants), respectively.

8.DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company has entered into interest rate protection agreements to manage exposure on its variable rate debt. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. Such exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform. The Company believes its contracts as of December31, 2005 and 2004 are with credit worthy institutions.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into eight interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under its new American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities. The Company has designated all eight of these swaps as cash flow hedges.
In August 2005, and as a result of the merger with SpectraSite, Inc., the Company acquired three interest rate swap instruments and one interest rate cap instrument. The three interest rate swaps, which had a fair value of $6.7 million at the date of acquisition, have an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million, a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 3.88% and expire in December 2009. The interest rate cap has a notional amount of $175.0 million, a fixed rate of 7.0%, and expires in February 2006. The interest rate swaps and the interest rate cap were not designated as cash flow hedges. During the year ended December31, 2005, the Company recorded $3.0 million of income, representing changes in fair market value which were charged to other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.
As of December31, 2004, the Company also had two interest rate caps outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $350.0 million (each at an interest rate of 6.0%) that expire in 2006. As of December31, 2004, there was no fair value associated with these interest rate caps.

9.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Obligations The Company leases certain land, office and tower space under operating leases that expire over various terms. Many of the leases contain renewal options with specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal option. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to CPI or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. (See note 1.) Future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases include payments for certain renewal periods at the Companys option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that the Company will renew the lease. Such payments in effect at December31, 2005 are as follows (in thousands): Year Ending December31, 2006 $ 190,129 2007 183,595 2008 180,910 2009 178,456 2010 172,060 Thereafter 2,507,444 Total $ 3,412,594 Aggregate rent expense (including the effect of straight-line rent expense) under operating leases for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 approximated $168,670,000, $118,741,000, and $113,956,000 respectively.
F-31 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Future minimum payments under capital leases (see note 7) in effect at December31, 2005 are as follows (in thousands): Year Ending December31, 2006 $ 4,551 2007 3,965 2008 3,567 2009 3,232 2010 3,257 Thereafter 199,335 Total minimum lease payments 217,907 Less amounts representing interest (173,562 ) Present value of capital lease obligations $ 44,345 Customer Leases The Companys lease agreements with its customers vary depending upon the region and the industry of the customer. In the United States, initial terms for television and radio broadcast leases typically range between 10 to 20 years, while leases for wireless communications providers generally have initial terms of five to ten years. In Mexico and Brazil, the Companys typical tenant lease has an initial term of 10 years. In most cases, the Companys tenant leases have multiple renewal terms at the option of the customer.
Future minimum rental receipts expected from customers under non-cancelable operating lease agreements in effect at December31, 2005 are as follows (in thousands): Year Ending December31, 2006 $ 1,044,097 2007 988,154 2008 930,441 2009 881,145 2010 759,347 Thereafter 2,150,543 Total $ 6,753,727 Verestar Verestar, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in December2003. In connection with the bankruptcy filing, the Company asserted certain claims against Verestar as an unsecured creditor. If Verestar fails to honor certain of its contractual obligations because of its bankruptcy filing or otherwise, claims may be made against the Company for breaches by Verestar of those contracts as to which the Company is primarily or secondarily liable as a guarantor. The Company accrued its initial estimate of costs to settle these obligations of $10.0 million as of December31, 2003 and has adjusted such estimate to reflect actual payments and changes in estimates made through December31, 2005. The liability of $3.2 million is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2005 and 2004.
In June2004, the Bankruptcy Court approved a stipulation between Verestar and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors appointed in the bankruptcy proceeding (the Committee) that permits the Committee to file claims on behalf of Verestar against the Company, its affiliates and certain current and former officers and directors of Verestar and the Company. The Committee requested and received authorization from the Bankruptcy Court to take discovery of the Company and certain of Verestars current and former officers and F-32 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) directors. The Company produced various documents and a limited number of depositions were conducted by the Committee. In July2005, the Committee filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and certain of its and Verestars current and former officers, directors and advisors, and also filed a complaint in the Bankruptcy Court against the Company. (The case initially filed in the District Court has since been transferred to the Bankruptcy Court, and both cases are now pending as a single, consolidated case before the same Bankruptcy judge.) The Company may be obligated or may agree to indemnify certain of the defendants named in the litigation. The complaint originally filed in the District Court asserts various causes of action against the defendants, including declaratory judgment for alter ego, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, conspiracy, tortuous interference with contract and business relations, deepening insolvency, and avoidance and recovery of fraudulent transfers and preferential transfers. In connection with those claims, the Committee is seeking unspecified compensatory damages of not less than $150.0 million, punitive damages and various costs and fees. The complaint originally filed in the Bankruptcy Court includes an objection to the Companys claims against Verestar and seeks to recharacterize and equitably subordinate those claims. The complaint also seeks substantive consolidation of the Companys assets and liabilities with Verestars assets and liabilities. During 2005, the Company, together with the individual defendants, filed motions to dismiss certain claims asserted in the complaints. In February 2006, the Bankruptcy Court heard oral arguments on the motions to dismiss, but has not yet decided any of the motions. The outcome of this complex litigation cannot be predicted by the Company with certainty, is dependent upon many factors beyond the Companys control, and could take several years to resolve. In the opinion of management, the resolution of the claims made against the Company by the Committee will not likely have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Finally, the Company will incur additional costs in connection with its involvement in the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings. Such costs will be recorded as incurred and reflected within discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
SBC Transactions SpectraSite entered into an agreement with SBC Communications Inc. (SBC) for the lease or sublease of approximately 2,500 towers from SBC between December 2000 and August 2004. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 27 years, assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. SpectraSite has the option to purchase the sites subject to the lease or sublease upon their expiration. Each of the towers is assigned into an annual tranche, ranging from 2013 to 2032, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to that tower. The purchase price for each site is a fixed amount stated in the sublease for that site plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related tower by SBC. The aggregate purchase option price for the towers leased and subleased was approximately $282.4 million as of December31, 2005, and will accrete at a rate of 10%per year to the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site. For all such sites purchased by SpectraSite at the expiration of the lease or sublease, SBC has the right to continue to lease the reserved space for successive one year terms at a rent equal to the lesser of the agreed upon market rate and the then current monthly fee, which is subject to an annual increase based on changes in the CPI.
ALLTEL Transaction In December 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with ALLTEL to acquire communications towers from ALLTEL through a 15-year sublease agreement. Pursuant to the agreement with ALLTEL, as amended, the Company acquired rights to a total of 1,776 towers in tranches between April 2001 and March 2002. The Company has the option at the expiration of the sublease period, which will occur between April 2016 and March 2017 based on the original closing date for such tranche of towers, to purchase the tower sites at a purchase price per tower of $27,500 and will accrete at a rate of 3%per annum. The aggregate purchase option price for the subleased towers was approximately $56.2 million as of December31, 2005. At ALLTELs option, at the expiration of the sublease period the purchase price will be payable in cash or with 769 shares of the Companys ClassA common stock per tower.
F-33 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Build-to-Suit Agreements As of December31, 2005, the Company was party to various arrangements relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build-to-suit agreements. During the year ended December31, 2005, the Company completed construction on 137 towers in Mexico pursuant to these build-to-suit agreements for an aggregate cost of approximately $24.2 million. As of December31, 2005, the Company had completed construction on a total 167 towers in Mexico under the terms of these agreements, and the Company is obligated over a two-year remaining period to construct approximately 130 additional towers in Mexico for an aggregate cost of approximately $23.0 million.
Guarantees and Indemnifications The Company complies with the liability and measurement provisions of FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No.5, 57 and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No.34. The Company enters into agreements from time to time in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which it agrees to indemnify third parties for certain claims. The Company has also entered into purchase and sale agreements relating to the sale or acquisition of assets containing customary indemnification provisions. The Companys indemnification obligations under these agreements generally are limited solely to damages resulting from breaches of representations and warranties or covenants under the applicable agreements, but do not guaranty future performance. In addition, payments under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to whatever defenses the Company may have and are governed by dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract. Further, the Companys obligations under these agreements may be limited in duration and/or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for payments made by the Company. The Company has not historically made any material payments under these agreements and, as of December31, 2005, is not aware of any agreements that could result in a material payment.
Litigation The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of Company management, after consultation with counsel, other than the litigation related to the Verestar bankruptcy discussed above, there are no matters currently pending which would, in the event of an adverse outcome, have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
10.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS In addition to the related party transactions described in notes 11 and 14, the Company had the following related party transactions during the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with the brother of J. Michael Gearon, Jr. (Mr. Gearon), an executive officer of the Company, for the provision of implementation, development and deployment services on the Companys projects in Brazil. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company agreed to pay the individual a consulting fee of $5,000 per month, plus expenses.

In February 2004, Steven B. Dodge (Mr. Dodge) the Companys former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, retired from the Companys Board of Directors and as Chairman of the Company. The Company agreed to pay Mr.Dodge $1.4 million pursuant to the terms of his retirement agreement. The expense was reflected in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense in the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2003. Mr.Dodge also elected to convert all of his shares of the Companys Class B common stock into shares of ClassA common stock. (See note 14.) During the year ended December31, 2003, a director of the Company (who resigned in January 2004) was a partner of J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC (JPMP). For the year ended December31, 2003 JP Morgan Chase Bank F-34 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Chase) was a lender under the Companys credit facilities. Chase is an affiliate of JPMP, which indirectly controls J.P. Morgan Partners (BHCA), L.P. (JPLP) and J.P. Morgan Partners (23ASBIC), LLC (JPSBIC), stockholders of the Company. During 2003 Chase had participation percentages under the Companys credit facility ranging from 0.88% to 2.22%. At December31, 2003, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the credit facility was approximately $704.7 million. Chases participation in the credit facility at December31, 2003 was 1.77%. Chases approximate share of interest and fees paid by the Company pursuant to its various credit arrangements was approximately $0.7 million in 2003. In addition, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., an affiliate of Chase, was an initial purchaser in certain of the Companys note offerings during 2003 and received initial purchasers discounts and commissions in connection therewith.
As of December31, 2004, amounts outstanding under demand loans to certain executive officers approximated $0.1 million. These loans were made prior to July30, 2002, and were repaid in full during the year ended December31, 2005.
During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company retained certain affiliates of Nordblom Co. Inc., including Nordic Properties, to provide various real estate services in connection with the Companys acquisition, financing, ownership and leasing of several properties. Services rendered by those companies included the following: advice in connection with the acquisition and mortgage financing of two office buildings in which the Company maintained regional offices (one of which was sold in May 2003); the management of those buildings; and the leasing of space in certain of these buildings. The Company paid the Nordblom companies, including Nordic Properties, an aggregate of $117,000, $143,000, and $151,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Two brothers and the father of Mr.Dodges wife own the controlling interest of Nordblom Co. Inc. and Nordic Properties. Mr.Dodges wife has no interest in Nordblom Co. Inc. or Nordic Properties and Mr.Dodge was not involved in the negotiation of any of the arrangements.
In December 2002, in connection with a potential financing transaction between the Company and SPO Partners II, LP (SPO), the Company entered into a letter agreement with SPO, which at the time was a holder of more than 5% of its ClassA common stock. The agreement provided for a $2.0 million break-up fee (plus expenses) payable to SPO in the event that the Company consummated an alternative financing transaction. As a result of the ATI 12.25% Notes offering described in note 7, the Company paid this $2.0 million break-up fee and recorded these expenses in other expense in the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2003.
11.ATC INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ATC Mexico Holding Corp.
During the year ended December31, 2004, the Company repurchased a 12.0% interest in ATC Mexico from certain stockholders of ATC Mexico. The Company owned 100% of ATC Mexico as of December31, 2005 and 2004. In accordance with FASB No.141 Business Combinations the acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase prices have been allocated to the net assets acquired (principally intangible assets) and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
In April 2004, the Company repurchased an 8.8% interest in ATC Mexico from J. Michael Gearon, Jr. (Mr. Gearon), an executive officer of the Company. Mr.Gearon had originally purchased this interest in ATC Mexico from the Company in October 2001 for $8.4 million ($1.7 million in cash and the remaining portion of the purchase price with a 7% secured note due 2010 in the principal amount of $6.7 million). In the first quarter of 2004, Mr.Gearon exercised his right to require the Company to purchase his interest in ATC Mexico. In consideration for his interest in ATC Mexico, the Company issued to Mr.Gearon 2,203,968 shares of its ClassA common stock and paid $3.7 million in cash, representing 80% of the aggregate purchase price for Mr.Gearons interest. The 2,203,968 shares issued to Mr.Gearon had an aggregate market value on the date of issuance of F-35 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) $24.8 million. Payment of the remaining 20% of the purchase price of $7.3 million, plus interest, was contingent upon ATC Mexico satisfying certain performance criteria. In February 2005, the Companys Board of Directors determined that the performance criteria had been satisfied, and the Company paid Mr.Gearon $7.7 million in cash. The Companys Board of Directors approved the determination of the fair market value of Mr.Gearons interest with the assistance of an independent financial advisor. Interest income received by the Company from Mr.Gearon on the secured note approximated $196,000 and $470,000 for the years ended December31, 2004, and 2003 respectively.
In October 2004, the Company repurchased the remaining 3.2% minority interest in ATC Mexico held by certain employees, including William H. Hess (Mr. Hess), an executive officer of the Company. In the first quarter of 2004, these employees exercised options to purchase an aggregate of 318 shares of ATC Mexico under the ATC Mexico Stock Option Plan. In connection with the issuance of these shares, the Company recorded a $1.8 million reduction to stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2004. Such adjustment reflected the difference in the Companys carrying value of the interest in ATC Mexicos equity that was sold over the proceeds received for that interest. (See note 1.) The employees holding these shares had the right to require the Company to purchase their interests in ATC Mexico six months following their issuance at the then fair market value. In October 2004, these employees exercised these rights and required the Company to purchase their collective 3.2% interest in ATC Mexico. In consideration for their interests in ATC Mexico, the Company issued to these employees an aggregate of 1,155,678 shares of ClassA common stock, representing 80% of the aggregate purchase price for their collective interests. The 1,155,678 shares issued to these employees had an aggregate market value on the date of issuance of $18.5 million. Payment of the remaining 20% of the net purchase price was contingent upon ATC Mexico satisfying certain performance criteria. In February 2005, the Companys Board of Directors determined that the performance criteria had been satisfied, and the Company issued to these employees 159,836 shares of ClassA common stock, net of 58,730 shares of ClassA common stock retained by the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations. On the date of issuance, these 218,566 shares had an aggregate market value of $3.9 million. The Companys Board of Directors approved the determination of the fair market value of the interests held by these employees with the assistance of an independent financial advisor. The Company recorded the aggregate purchase price of these shares of $3.9 million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2005. In accordance with SFAS No.141, the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase prices have been allocated to the net assets acquired (principally intangible assets) and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
ATC South America Holding Corp.
During each of the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, ATC South America issued shares of its common stock to certain employees. During the year ended December31, 2005, the Company repurchased shares from these employees. The Company owned 90.7% and 98.4% of ATC South America as of December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
During the year ended December31, 2004, the Company consummated a previously disclosed arrangement with Mr.Gearon pursuant to which he purchased an equity interest in ATC South America. In March 2004, ATC South America issued to Mr.Gearon stock representing an approximate 1.6% interest for approximately $1.2 million in cash. In connection with the issuance of these shares, the Company recorded a $0.1 million increase in stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2004. Such adjustment represented the difference in the proceeds received for that interest over the Companys carrying value of the interest in ATC South Americas equity. The purchase price represented the fair market value of the interest on the date of the sale, as determined by the Board of Directors with the assistance of an independent financial advisor. Pursuant to the arrangement, Mr.Gearon had the right to require the Company to purchase his interest in ATC South America, for its then fair market value, at any time after the earliest to occur of December31, 2004 or Mr.Gearons death or disability, and the Company had the right to purchase Mr.Gearons interest in F-36 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) ATC South America, for its then fair market value, at any time after the earliest to occur of December31, 2005, Mr.Gearons death or disability, or the occurrence of either a Gearon Termination Event or a Forfeiture Event (each as defined in the Companys stockholder agreement with Mr.Gearon).
As part of Mr.Gearons investment, ATC South Americas Board of Directors also approved the formation of the ATC South America Stock Option Plan that provides for the issuance of options to officers, employees, directors and consultants of ATC South America, including Mr.Gearon, to purchase up to an aggregate 10.3% interest in ATC South America. In the first quarter of 2004, ATC South America granted options to purchase 6,024 shares of ATC South America common stock to officers and employees, including Messrs. Gearon and Hess, who received options to purchase shares representing a 6.7% and 1.6% interest, respectively. The exercise price was $1,349 per share, which was determined to be the fair market value per share on the date of issuance based on an independent appraisal performed at the Companys request. Options granted vest upon the earliest to occur of (a)the exercise by or on behalf of Mr.Gearon of his right to require the Company to purchase his interest in ATC South America, (b)the exercise by the Company of its right to acquire Mr.Gearons interest in ATC South America, or (c)July1, 2006. These options expire ten years from the date of grant. (See note 14).
In October 2005, Mr.Gearon exercised his right to require the Company to purchase his 1.6% interest in ATC South America. The purchase price for Mr.Gearons interest in ATC South America is subject to review by an independent financial advisor, and is payable in cash or shares of the Companys ClassA common stock, at the Companys option. In October 2005, in connection with the exercise by Mr.Gearon of his right to require the Company to purchase his interest in ATC South America, all options granted under the ATC South America Stock Option Plan vested in full and were exercised. Upon exercise of these options, the holders received 4,428 shares of ATC South America (representing a 7.8% interest), net of 1,596 shares retained by the Company to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations. As of December31, 2005, as a result of exercises of options granted pursuant to the ATC South America Stock Option Plan, Mr.Gearon owns a 6.5% interest in ATC South America and Mr.Hess owns a 1.2% interest in ATC South America. (See note 14.) In connection with the issuance of these shares to employees, the Company recorded a $2.0 million increase in stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2005. Such adjustment reflected the difference in the proceeds received for that interest and the Companys carrying value of the interest in ATC South Americas equity that was sold. (See note 1). The 1,596 shares retained by the Company described above have been treated as a repurchase of a minority interest in accordance with SFAS No.141. As a result, the Company recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation adjustment of $5.4 million as an increase to intangible assets and a corresponding increase in minority interest as of the date of acquisition. The preliminary purchase price will be finalized in the first half of 2006, but is not expected to significantly impact depreciation and amortization expense when finalized. In addition, these holders may require the Company to purchase their interests in ATC South America at their then fair market value six months following their issuance, which date will occur in April 2006. Based on the fair value information described in note 18, the Company estimates that its repurchase obligation with respect to these shares in April 2006 will be approximately $19 million.
F-37 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 12.IMPAIRMENTS, NET LOSS ON SALE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, RESTRUCTURING AND MERGER RELATED EXPENSE The significant components reflected in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations include the following: Impairments and Net Loss on Sale of Long-Lived Assets During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets (primarily related to its rental and management segment) of $19.1 million, $22.3 million and $28.3 million, respectively.
Non-Core Asset Impairment Charges During the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 respectively, the Company sold a limited number of non-core towers and other non-core assets and recorded impairment charges to write-down these and other non-core assets to net realizable value. During the year ended December31, 2003, the Company sold approximately 300 non-core towers and certain other non-core assets and recorded impairment charges to write-down these and other non-core assets to net realizable value. As a result, the Company recorded impairment charges and net losses of approximately $16.8 million, $17.7 million and $19.1 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Construction-In-Progress Impairment Charges For the year ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company wrote-off approximately $2.3 million, $4.6 million and $9.2 million, respectively, of construction-in-progress costs, primarily associated with sites that it no longer planned to build.
Restructuring Expense During the year ended December31, 2005, the Company made cash payments against its previous accrued restructuring liability in the amount of $0.8 million. During the year ended December31, 2004, the Company incurred employee separation costs of $0.8 million and decreased its lease terminations and other facility closing costs liability by $0.1 million. During the year ended December31, 2003, the Company incurred employee separation costs primarily associated with a reorganization of certain functions within its rental and management segment and increased its accrued restructuring liability by $2.3 million. Such charges are reflected in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003.
The following table displays activity with respect to the accrued restructuring liability for the years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 (in thousands). The accrued restructuring liability is reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2005 and 2004.

The Company expects to pay the balance of these employee separation liabilities prior to the end of 2006. Additionally, the Company continues to negotiate certain lease terminations associated with this restructuring liability.
Merger Related Expense During the year ended December31, 2005, the Company assumed certain obligations, as a result of the merger with SpectraSite, Inc., primarily related to employee separation costs of former F-38 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) SpectraSite employees. Severance payments made to former SpectraSite, Inc. employees were subject to plans and agreements established by SpectraSite, Inc. and assumed by the Company in connection with the merger. These costs were recognized as an assumed liability in the preliminary purchase price allocation. In addition, the Company also incurred certain merger related costs for additional employee retention and separation costs incurred during the year ended December31, 2005. The following table displays the activity with respect to this accrued liability for the year ended December31, 2005 (in thousands): AssumedMerger Liability MergerRelated Expense Cash Payments Liabilityasof December31,2005 Employee separations $ 22,373 $ 5,074 $ (6,484 ) $ 20,963 As described in note 2, there have been and may be additional changes in estimates of the assumed liability until the allocation of the preliminary SpectraSite, Inc. purchase price is finalized. The current portion of the liability of $14.5 million is reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses and the long-term portion of the liability of $6.5 million is reflected in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2005. The Company expects to pay the long-term portion of these merger related liabilities through the third quarter of 2008.
The Company modified certain option awards to revise vesting and exercise terms for certain employees that were terminated in connection with the SpectraSite, Inc. merger. The Company recorded a charge of $1.6 million, which is included in merger related expense and additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December31, 2005.
13.INCOME TAXES The Company files a consolidated United States federal tax return, which includes all of its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and the Company also files combined or consolidated returns in many different states. These returns reflect different combinations of the Companys subsidiaries and are dependent on the connection each subsidiary has with a particular state. The Company and its subsidiaries have entered into a tax sharing agreement providing, among other things, that each of its subsidiaries pay for its share of income taxes based on the proportion of such subsidiaries tax liability on a separate return basis to the total tax liability on a consolidated basis. The following information pertains to the Companys income taxes on a consolidated basis.

F-40 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) At December31, 2005, the Company had net federal and state operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income of approximately $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Companys net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows (in thousands): Years ended December31, Federal State 2006 to 2010 $ 5,248 $ 469,747 2011 to 2015 10,012 272,662 2016 to 2020 397,691 777,707 2021 to 2025 1,744,552 897,896 Total $ 2,157,503 $ 2,418,012 SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that companies record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December31, 2005, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of approximately $422.4 million, including approximately $249.5 million attributable to SpectraSite, primarily related to net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. Approximately $237.8 million of the SpectraSite valuation allowance was assumed as of the acquisition date. The balance of the valuation allowance primarily relates to net state deferred tax assets. The Company has not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily its federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes the Company will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax carryforward period.
The Company intends to recover a portion of its deferred tax asset through its federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, the Company filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003, of which the Company initially anticipated receiving approximately $90.0 million. Based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities, the Company has revised its estimate of the net realizable value of the federal income tax refund claims and anticipates receiving a refund of approximately $65.0 million as a result of these claims by the end of 2006. There can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of any refund.
The recoverability of the Companys remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on its current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of its assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on its current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that the net deferred tax asset will be realized.
The realization of the Companys deferred tax assets as of December31, 2005 will be dependent upon its ability to generate approximately $1.3 billion in taxable income from January1, 2006 to December31, 2025. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or carry back losses, as described above, it will be required to reduce its net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity.
From time to time the Company is subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. During the year ended F-41 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) December31, 2005, the Company recorded a $29.5 million income tax provision to reflect a reduction in managements estimate of the net realizable value of the Companys pending federal income tax refund claims as described above. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December31, 2005.
Depending on the resolution of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in notes 3 and 9, the Company may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for its investment in Verestar. No income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings.

In February 2004, Mr.Dodge retired from the Companys Board of Directors and elected to convert all of his shares of the Companys Class B common stock, which triggered the Dodge Conversion Event as defined in the Companys charter. Accordingly, all outstanding shares of Class B common stock were converted into shares of ClassA common stock on a one-for-one basis. In addition, in February 2004, all outstanding shares of the Companys Class C common stock were converted into shares of its ClassA common stock on a one-for-one basis.
Warrants In January 2003, the Company issued warrants to purchase approximately 11.4million shares of its ClassA common stock in connection with the ATI 12.25% Notes offering. These warrants became exercisable on January29, 2006 at an exercise price of $0.01 per share and will expire on August1, 2008. (See notes 7 and 18.) In August 2005, in connection with the merger with SpectraSite, Inc., the Company assumed warrants to purchase shares of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock. (See note 2.) As of the merger completion date, each warrant F-42 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) was exercisable for two shares of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock at an exercise price of $32 per warrant. Upon completion of the merger, each warrant to purchase shares of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock automatically converted into a warrant to purchase shares of the Companys ClassA common stock, such that upon exercise of each warrant, the holder has a right to receive 3.575 shares of American Tower ClassA common stock in lieu of each share of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock that would have been receivable under each assumed warrant prior to the merger. Upon completion of the Companys merger with SpectraSite, Inc., these warrants were exercisable for approximately 6.8million shares of ClassA common stock. As of December31, 2005, warrants to purchase approximately 6.4million shares of ClassA common stock remained outstanding. These warrants will expire on February10, 2010.
In addition, as of December31, 2004, the Company had warrants outstanding to purchase approximately 2.7million shares of its ClassA common stock at an exercise price of $22.00 per share. These warrants expired in January 2005.

Stock Option Plans The Company maintains a stock option plan for directors, officers and employees (the Plan), which provides for non-qualified and incentive stock options. Exercise prices in the case of incentive stock options are not less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Exercise prices in the case of non-qualified stock options are set at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors (which to date has not been less than the fair market value on the date of grant). As of December31, 2005, the option pool under the Plan consists of 32.9 million shares of common stock. Option grants generally vest ratably over various periods, generally four years, commencing one year from the date of grant. Option grants generally expire ten years from the date of grant.
In August 2005, in connection with the merger with SpectraSite, Inc., the Company assumed stock options granted under SpectraSites 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Upon completion of the merger, the options to purchase shares of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock automatically converted into options to purchase shares of the Companys ClassA common stock, such that upon exercise of each option, the holder has a right to receive 3.575 shares of ClassA common stock in lieu of each share of SpectraSite, Inc. common stock that would have been receivable under each assumed stock option prior to the merger, at an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price of the SpectraSite, Inc. option prior to the merger divided by 3.575. Upon completion of the merger, the assumed SpectraSite, Inc. stock options were exercisable for an aggregate of 9.9million shares of the Companys ClassA common stock. Of these options, options to purchase approximately 8.3million shares were fully vested as of the merger date and the remaining unvested options to purchase 1.6million shares vest monthly through the first quarter of 2008. As of December31, 2005, options to purchase approximately 2.0million shares of ClassA common stock remained outstanding. The Company does not plan to grant any additional options under this plan.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. During the year ended December31, 2005, the Company reevaluated the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees. As a result, the Company lowered its expected volatility assumption for option grants to approximately 30% and increased the expected life of option grants to 6.25 years using the simplified method permitted by SEC SAB No.107. (See note 1.) The weighted average fair values of the Companys options granted during 2005, 2004 and F-44 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 2003 were $10.08, $7.05, and $6.32 per share, respectively. Key assumptions used to apply this pricing model are as follows: July 1, 2005 December31,2005 January1,2005 June 30, 2005 2004 2003 Approximate risk-free interest rate 3.22%-4.40% 4.17%-4.40% 4.23% 4.00% Expected life of option grants 6.25years 4years 4years 4years Expected volatility of underlying stock 29.6% 75.3%-79.2% 80.6% 86.6% Expected volatility of underlying stock (ATC Mexico and ATC South America Plans) N/A N/A N/A N/A Expected dividends N/A N/A N/A N/A Voluntary Option Exchanges In February 2004, the Company issued to eligible employees 1,032,717 options with an exercise price of $11.19 per share, the fair market value of the ClassA common stock on the date of grant. These options were issued in connection with a voluntary option exchange program entered into by the Company in August 2003, pursuant to which the Company accepted for surrender and cancelled options to purchase a total of 1,831,981 shares of its ClassA common stock having an exercise price of $10.25 or greater. The program, which was offered to both full and part-time employees, excluding the Companys executive officers and its directors, provided for the grant (at least six months and one day from the surrender date to employees still employed on that date) of new options exercisable for two shares of ClassA common stock for every three shares of ClassA common stock issuable upon exercise of a surrendered option. No options were granted to any employees who participated in the exchange offer between the cancellation date and the new grant date.
ATC Mexico Stock Option Plan The Company maintains a stock option plan in its ATC Mexico subsidiary (ATC Mexico Plan). The ATC Mexico Plan provides for the issuance of options to officers, employees, directors and consultants of ATC Mexico. The ATC Mexico Plan limits the number of shares of common stock which may be granted to an aggregate of 360 shares, subject to adjustment based on changes in ATC Mexicos capital structure. During 2002, ATC Mexico granted options to purchase 318 shares of ATC Mexico common stock to officers and employees. Such options were issued at one time with an exercise price of $10,000 per share. The exercise price per share was at fair market value as determined by the Board of Directors with the assistance of an independent appraisal performed at the Companys request. The fair value of ATC Mexico Plan options granted during 2002 were $3,611 per share as determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. As described in note 11, all outstanding options were exercised in March 2004. No options under the ATC Mexico Plan were outstanding as of December31, 2005. (See note 11.) ATC South America Stock Option Plan The Company maintains a stock option plan in its ATC South America subsidiary (ATC South America Plan). The ATC South America Plan provides for the issuance of options to officers, employees, directors and consultants of ATC South America. The ATC South America Plan limits the number of shares of common stock which may be granted to an aggregate of 6,144 shares, (an approximate 10.3% interest on a fully-diluted basis), subject to adjustment based on changes in ATC South Americas capital structure. During 2004, ATC South America granted options to purchase 6,024 shares of ATC South America common stock to officers and employees, including Messrs. Gearon and Hess, who received options to purchase an approximate 6.7% and 1.6% interest, respectively. Such options were issued at one time with an exercise price of $1,349 per share. The exercise price per share was at fair market value on the date of issuance as determined by the Board of Directors with the assistance of an independent appraisal performed at the Companys request. The fair value of ATC South America Plan options granted during 2004 were $79 per share as determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Options granted vest upon the earlier to occur of (a)the exercise by or on behalf of Mr.Gearon of his right to sell his interest in ATC South America to the Company, (b)the F-45 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) exercise by the Company of its right to acquire Mr.Gearons interest in ATC South America, or (c)July1, 2006. These options expire ten years from the date of grant. No options under the ATC South America Plan were exercised or cancelled in 2004, and no options were exercisable as of December31, 2004. In October 2005, in connection with the exercise by Mr.Gearons of his right to require the Company to purchase his interest in ATC South America, all options granted pursuant to the ATC South America Stock Option Plan vested in full and were exercised. Upon exercise of these options, the holders received 4,428 shares of ATC South America (representing a 7.8% interest), net of 1,596 shares retained by the Company to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations. The employees holding these shares may require the Company to purchase their interests in ATC South America six months following their issuance, which date will occur in April 2006. As a result of exercises of options granted pursuant to the ATC South America Stock Option Plan, Mr.Gearon owns a 6.5% interest in ATC South America and Mr.Hess owns a 1.2% interest in ATC South America. No options under the ATC South America Plan were granted in 2005, and as of December31, 2005, no options were outstanding under the ATC South America Plan. (See note 11.) Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Under the plan, shares of the Companys ClassA common stock may be purchased at six-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each offering period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period and may not purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock in a calendar year (based on market values at the beginning of each offering period). During 2005, 2004 and 2003, employees purchased 50,119, 85,750 and 200,287 shares, respectively, at weighted average prices per share of $15.32, $10.64 and $4.80 respectively. At December31, 2005, 4,002,498 shares remain reserved for future issuance under the plan.
Direct Stock Purchase Plan During 2004, the Company established a direct stock purchase plan for all eligible investors. Under the plan, shares of the Companys ClassA common stock may be purchased without payment of a brokerage fee, at a discount, by making an initial cash investment of at least $1,000 and up to $10,000. During the year ended December31, 2004, 295 shares of ClassA common stock were purchased at weighted average prices per share of $15.01. At December31, 2005 and 2004, 24,999,705 shares, respectively, remained reserved for future issuance under the plan. The Company suspended the direct stock purchase plan in May 2005. During the year ended December31, 2005, there were no shares purchased under the plan.
Stock Repurchase Program In November 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company intends to repurchase up to $750.0 million of its ClassA common stock through December 2006. The Company expects to utilize cash from operations, borrowings under its credit facilities and cash on hand to fund the repurchase program. Under the program, the Companys management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, the Company entered into a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allows the Company to repurchase its shares during periods when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. The program may be discontinued at any time. As of December31, 2005, the Company had repurchased 2.8million shares of its ClassA common stock for an aggregate of $76.6 million, of which $68.9 million was paid in cash prior to December31, 2005 and $7.7 million was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2005.

The rental and management segment provides for the leasing and subleasing of antenna sites on multi-tenant towers and other properties for a diverse range of customers primarily in the wireless communications and broadcast industries. The network development services segment offers services activities that support the Companys rental and management operations and the addition of new tenants and equipment on the Companys towers, including site acquisition, zoning, permitting and structural analysis.
The accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note1. In evaluating financial performance, management focuses on segment operating profit (loss), which excludes depreciation, amortization and accretion; corporate general, administrative and development expense; and impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense. This measure of operating profit (loss) is also before interest income, interest expense, other income (expense), loss on retirement of long-term obligations, minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries, loss on equity method investments, income taxes, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. For reporting purposes, the rental and management segment includes interest income, TV Azteca, net.
The Companys reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different services. They are managed separately because each segment requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies. Summarized financial information concerning the Companys reportable segments as of and for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is shown in the following tables. The Other expenses disclosure below represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as depreciation, amortization and accretion; corporate general, administrative and development expense; impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense; interest income; interest expense; loss on retirement of long-term obligations; and other income (expense).

In the third quarter of 2005, a merger transaction was completed between two customers within the rental and management segment, Sprint PCS and Nextel. If the transaction had occurred as of January1, 2005, the combined revenues of the customer would have accounted for approximately 14% of the Companys consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December31, 2005.
For the year ended December31, 2005, assuming the Companys merger with SpectraSite, Inc. occurred on January1, 2005, three customers within the rental and management and network development services segments would have accounted for greater than 10% of the Companys consolidated operating revenues: Cingular Wireless would have accounted for approximately 19% of revenues, Sprint Nextel (assuming the merger of Sprint PCS and Nextel occurred on January1, 2005) would have accounted for approximately 17% of revenues (approximately 22% including Sprint Nextel partners and affiliates) and Verizon Wireless would have accounted for approximately 10% of revenues.
For the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, one customer within the rental and management and network development services segments, Verizon Wireless, accounted for approximately 12% and 13%, respectively of the Companys consolidated operating revenues. In the fourth quarter of 2004, a merger transaction was completed between two customers, Cingular Wireless and AT&T Wireless. If the transaction had occurred as of January1, 2004, the combined revenues of the customer would have accounted for approximately 14% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December31, 2004.

18.SUBSEQUENT EVENTS ATI 12.25% Notes Redemption In December 2005, the Company issued a notice for the redemption on February1, 2006 of all outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes. On February1, 2006, the Company redeemed $227.7 million face amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value allocated to warrants) of ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. The Company used $0.5 million in cash on hand and $179.0 million in borrowings under the delayed draw term loan component of the American Tower credit facility to fund the redemption. The Company expects to record a charge of $19.9 million in the first quarter of 2006 related to the amounts paid in excess of carrying value and write-off of deferred financing fees. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding.
3.25% Convertible Notes In March 2006, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,840,025 shares of ClassA common stock upon conversion of $22.5 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, the holders of the 3.25% Notes received 81.808 shares of ClassA common stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. In connection with the conversion, the Company paid such holders an aggregate of $1.7 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Between January1, 2006 and March9, 2006, the Company repurchased 3.9million shares of ClassA common stock for an aggregate of $117.4 million pursuant to its stock repurchase program. As discussed in note 14 above, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program in November 2005 pursuant to which the Company intends to purchase up to $750.0 million of its ClassA common stock through December 2006.
Interest Rate Swap Agreements In January 2006, the Company entered into two additional interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations on our new credit facilities. These swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million, a weighted average fixed rate of 4.68% and will expire in October 2010. The Company has designated both swaps as cash flow hedges.
19.SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES ATIs payment obligations under the ATI 7.25% Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by American Tower Corporation (the Parent) and substantially all of the wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of ATI and the Parent, other than SpectraSite and its subsidiaries (collectively Guarantor F-50 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Subsidiaries). Prior to the Companys redemption of the ATI 12.25% Notes in February 2006, the ATI 12.25% Notes were likewise fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by ATI, the Parent, and the Guarantor Subsidiaries. The ATI 7.25% Notes and the subsidiary guarantees under the ATI 7.25% Notes are subordinated to all indebtedness under the American Tower credit facility and the SpectraSite credit facility.
The following condensed consolidating financial data illustrates the composition of the Parent, ATI and the combined Guarantor Subsidiaries, as well as the non-guarantor subsidiaries. As SpectraSite is not a Guarantor Subsidiary under the ATI 7.25% Notes, financial data for SpectraSite and its subsidiaries is included with the information for the non-guarantor subsidiaries. These statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and requirements of the SEC and the requirements contained in the ATI 7.25% Notes indenture. The Company believes that separate complete financial statements of the respective guarantors would not provide additional material information that would be useful in assessing the financial composition of the guarantors. No single guarantor has any significant legal restrictions on the ability of investors or creditors to obtain access to its assets in event of default on the subsidiary guarantee other than its subordination to the new American Tower credit facility and the new SpectraSite credit facility.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company under the equity method for purposes of the supplemental consolidating presentation. In addition, ATI and the Guarantor Subsidiaries account for their subsidiaries that are not guarantors under the equity method. (Earnings) losses of subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method are therefore reflected in their parents investment accounts. In addition, for presentation purposes, the Company has reflected its net deferred tax asset in the Parent column in the following condensed consolidating financial data. Intercompany receivables and payables related to deferred taxes are reflected in investments in and advances to subsidiaries in the following condensed consolidating financial data. The principal elimination entries eliminate investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions.
Subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December31, 2004, management determined that the previously presented condensed consolidating financial data for 2004 and 2003 did not reflect certain intercompany loans, related interest and management fees. The current presentation has been restated to reflect all intercompany activity related to these entities. The changes in presentation did not effect the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations, nor did the changes adversely impact the Companys compliance with debt covenants or ratios.
The following schedule reconciles the amounts as previously reported in the Companys condensed consolidating balance sheet as of December31, 2004 and the condensed consolidating statements of operations for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, to the corresponding restated amounts (in thousands): Parent ATI Guarantor Subsidiaries Non- Guarantor Subsidiaries Eliminations Consolidated
