References in this Annual Report to we, our and the Company refer to American Tower Corporation and its predecessor, as applicable, individually and collectively with its subsidiaries as the context requires.
iii Table of Contents PART I ITEM1.BUSINESS Overview We are a global independent owner, operator and developer of communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data and data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our rental and management operations, which accounted for approximately 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December31, 2014. Through our network development services business, we offer tower-related services domestically, which primarily support our site leasing business.
Our communications real estate portfolio of 75,594 communications sites, as of December31, 2014, includes 28,566 communications towers domestically, 46,598 communications towers internationally and 430 distributed antenna system (DAS) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators.
American Tower Corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of American Radio Systems Corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a free-standing public company in 1998. Since inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. Our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. We conduct our international operations primarily through our subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures.
On February5, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement with Verizon Communications, Inc. (Verizon) pursuant to which we expect to acquire the exclusive right to lease, acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to 11,489 wireless communications sites for $5.056 billion in cash at closing (the Proposed Verizon Transaction), subject to certain conditions and limited adjustments.
We operate as a REIT and therefore are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers.However, even as a REIT, we remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs). In addition, our international assets and operations, including those designated as direct or indirect qualified REIT subsidiaries or other disregarded entities of a REIT (collectively, QRSs), continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.
The use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be treated as QRSs, and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our TRSs to other subsidiaries, including QRSs. During the year ended December31, 2014, we restructured certain of our German subsidiaries and certain of our domestic TRSs, which included a portion of our network development services segment and indoor DAS networks business, to be treated as QRSs. As a result, as of December31, 2014, our QRSs include our domestic tower leasing business, most of our operations in Costa Rica, Germany and Mexico and a portion of our network development services segment and indoor DAS networks business.
Our continuing operations are reported in three segments: (i)domestic rental and management, (ii)international rental and management and (iii)network development services. For more information about our 1 Table of Contents business segments, as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate, see Item7 of this Annual Report under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Products and Services Rental and Management Operations Our rental and management operations accounted for approximately 98%, 98% and 97% of our total revenues for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their individual communications network equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, tower location, amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower, ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity. Our tenant leases are typically non-cancellable and have annual rent escalations. Our primary costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed, with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance. Our rental and management operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:  Consistent demand for our sites.
As a result of rapidly growing usage of wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue. Our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.
Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations.
In general, a tenant lease has an initial non-cancellable ten-year term with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually based on a fixed escalation percentage (approximately 3.0%in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both.
High lease renewal rates.
Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect the quality of their network. Historically, churn has been approximately 1% to 2% of total rental and management revenue per year. We define churn as revenue lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease and, in limited circumstances, such as a tenant bankruptcy, reductions in lease rates on existing leases. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our cash revenue lost on this basis by our comparable year ago period cash rental and management segment revenue.
High operating margins.
Incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively minimal. Therefore, as tenants are added, the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to operating profit. In addition, in many of our international markets, certain expenses, such as ground rent or fuel costs, are passed through and shared across our tenant base.
Low maintenance capital expenditures.
On average, we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites.
Our rental and management operations include the operation of communications towers, managed networks, the leasing of property interests and the provision of backup power through shared generators. Our domestic rental and management segment accounted for approximately 65%, 65% and 67% of our total revenues for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
2 Table of Contents Our international rental and management segment, which consists of communications sites in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Ghana, India, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and Uganda, provides a source of growth and diversification, including exposure to markets in various stages of wireless network development. In November 2014, we expanded our global footprint by signing an agreement to acquire over 4,800 communications sites in Nigeria. Our international rental and management segment accounted for approximately 33%, 33% and 30% of our total revenues for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Communications Towers.
Approximately 95%, 96% and 96% of revenue in our rental and management segments was attributable to our communications towers for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
We lease real estate on our communications towers to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services, including cellular voice and data, broadcasting, enhanced specialized mobile radio, mobile video and fixed microwave.Our top domestic and international tenants by revenue are as follows:  Domestic: AT&T Mobility, Sprint Nextel, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile USA accounted for an aggregate of approximately 84% of domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December31, 2014.
International: Telefnica (in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Mexico and Peru), MTN Group Limited (in Ghana, South Africa and Uganda), Nextel International (in Brazil, Chile and Mexico), Grupo Iusacell, S.A. de C.V. (in Mexico, acquired by AT&T in January 2015) and Vodafone (in Germany, Ghana, India and South Africa), accounted for an aggregate of approximately 57% of international rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December31, 2014.
Accordingly, we are subject to certain risks, as set forth in Item1A of this Annual Report under the caption Risk FactorsA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants. In addition, we are subject to risks related to our international operations, as set forth under the caption Risk FactorsOur foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Managed Networks, Property Interests and Shared Generators.
In addition to our communications sites, we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions, provide communications site management services to third parties, manage and lease property interests under carrier or other third-party communications sites and provide back-up power sources to tenants at our sites.
Managed Networks.
We own and operate DAS networks primarily in malls and casinos in the United States, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ghana, India and Mexico. We obtain rights from property owners to install and operate in-building DAS networks, and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations. We also offer outdoor DAS networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the United States. Typically, we design, build and operate our outdoor DAS networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites. We also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics.In addition, we provide management services to property owners in the United States who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation. As the demand for advanced wireless devices in urban markets evolves, we continue to evaluate infrastructure, such as small cell deployment, that may support our tenants networks in these areas.
Property Interests . We own a portfolio of property interests in the United States under carrier or other third-party communications sites, which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements.
3 Table of Contents  Shared Generators .We have contracts with certain of our tenants in the United States pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generators.
Network Development Services Through our network development services, we offer tower-related services domestically, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services. Network development services primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites, including in connection with provider network upgrades. This segment accounted for approximately 2%, 2% and 3% of our total revenues for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Site Acquisition, Zoning and Permitting . We engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects, as well as on behalf of our tenants. We typically work with our tenants engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants needs and meet their coverage objectives. Once a new site is identified, we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed, and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site.
Structural Analysis.
We offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers. Our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed, which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision. Our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by, among other things, reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness, while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties.
Strategy Operational Strategy Our operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless communications services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets, tablets and other mobile devices, and the corresponding expansion of communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies. To achieve this, our primary focus is to (i)increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio, (ii)invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio, (iii)further improve upon our operational performance and (iv)maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure.
Increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio.
We believe that our highest returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in the United States and in our international markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers. As a result, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located for wireless service providers and have capacity available for additional tenants. In the United States, incremental carrier capital spending is being driven primarily by the build-out of fourth generation (4G)networks, while our international markets are in various stages of network development. As of December31, 2014, we had a global average of approximately 1.9 tenants per tower. We believe that many of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites.
4 Table of Contents  Invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio.
We seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital programs, new site construction and acquisitions. We believe we can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns by pursuing such investments. In addition, we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases.
Further improve upon our operational performance.
We will continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve our efficiencies and provide superior service to our customers. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis.
Maintain a strong balance sheet.
We remain committed to our disciplined financial policies, which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade ratings. We remain committed to reducing our net leverage through a combination of debt repayment and our continued growth. We continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position and, as of December31, 2014, had approximately $2.7 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to selectively invest in our portfolio.
Capital Allocation Strategy The objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital. To maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). After complying with our REIT distribution requirements and paying dividends on our preferred stock, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt, as necessary, to reduce our net leverage to be within our long-term target range.
Capital expenditure program.
We will continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our annual capital expenditure program. This includes capital expenditures associated with maintenance, increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction, land interest acquisitions and shared generator installations.
Acquisitions.
We intend to pursue acquisitions of communications sites in our existing or new markets where we can meet our risk-adjusted return on investment criteria. Our risk-adjusted hurdle rates consider additional risks such as the country and counter-parties involved, investment and economic climate, legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk.
Return excess capital to stockholders.
If we have excess capital available after funding (i)our required distributions, (ii)our capital expenditures, (iii)repayment of debt, as necessary, to reduce our net leverage ratio toward our targeted range and (iv)anticipated future investments, including acquisition opportunities, we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders.
During 2014, we generated $2.1 billion of cash from operating activities, which along with incremental debt, was used to fund $1.9 billion of investments, including $1.0 billion of acquisitions and $974.4 million of capital expenditures. In addition, in 2014, we paid regular cash distributions in the aggregate of approximately $404.6 million to our common stockholders and approximately $16.0 million to our preferred stockholders.
International Growth Strategy We believe that, in certain international markets, we can create substantial value by either establishing a new, or expanding our existing communications real estate leasing business. Therefore, we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk-adjusted return objectives can be 5 Table of Contents achieved. We strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by complementing our presence in emerging markets with operations in more developed and established markets, which enables us to leverage multiple stages of wireless network development throughout our global footprint. Our international growth strategy includes a disciplined, individualized market evaluation, in which we conduct the following analyses:  Country analysis.
Prior to entering a new market, we conduct an extensive review of the countrys historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals, including inflation outlook and foreign currency exchange rate trends, capital markets, tax regime and investment alternatives, and the general business, political and legal environments, including property rights and regulatory regime.
Wireless industry analysis.
To confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower company, we analyze the competitiveness of the countrys wireless market, such as the pricing environment, past and potential industry consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development. Characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include (i)multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and (ii)incremental spectrum from auctions that have occurred or are anticipated to occur is being, or will be, deployed.
Opportunity and counterparty analysis.
Once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry, we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis. This includes evaluating (i)the type of transaction, (ii)its ability to meet our risk-adjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved, including the anticipated anchor tenant and (iii)how the transaction fits within our long-term strategic objectives, including future potential investment and expansion within the region.
Recent Transactions Acquisitions From January1, 2014 through December31, 2014, we increased our communications site portfolio by approximately 8,450 sites, including approximately 3,133 build-to-suits, and we believe the assets constructed and acquired will be accretive to our consolidated operating margins. Significant acquisitions during the year ended December31, 2014 included the acquisition of (i)100% of the equity interests ofBR Towers S.A., a Brazilian telecommunications real estate company (BR Towers), which at closing owned, or held exclusive use rights for, 4,617 towers and 47 property interests inBrazil and (ii)entities holding a portfolio of 59 communications sites, which at the time of acquisition were leased primarily to radio and television broadcast tenants, and four property interests in the United States from Richland Properties LLC and other related entities (Richland).
In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we signed definitive agreements to acquire approximately 11,280 additional communications sites in Brazil and Nigeria, and in February 2015, we signed a definitive agreement for the Proposed Verizon Transaction to acquire the exclusive right to lease, acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to 11,489 wireless communications sites in the United States.
We continue to evaluate potential complementary services to supplement our growth and expansion strategy, as well as opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business. For more information about our acquisitions, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Financing Transactions During the year ended December31, 2014, to complement our operational strategy to selectively invest in and grow our communications real estate portfolio, we strengthened our balance sheet by completing a number of 6 Table of Contents key financing initiatives, including those set forth below. For more information about our financing transactions, see Item7 of this Annual Report under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Senior Notes Offerings.
In January 2014, we completed a registered public offering through a reopening of our (i)3.40% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the 3.40% Notes), in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million and our (ii)5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the 5.00% Notes), in an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million. In August 2014, we completed a registered public offering of our 3.450% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the 3.450% Notes) in an aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million. We used the net proceeds from each offering primarily to repay certain indebtedness under our existing credit facilities.
Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock Offering.
In May 2014, we completed a registered public offering of 6,000,000 shares of our 5.25% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share (the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock).We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund acquisitions initially funded by indebtedness incurred under our $2.0 billion multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2013 Credit Facility).
Credit Facilities.
In September 2014, we entered into an amendment and restatement of our $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2012 Credit Facility, as amended and restated, the 2014 Credit Facility), which, among other things, increased the commitments thereunder to $1.5 billion and extended the maturity date to January31, 2020. As a result, as of December31, 2014, we had the ability to borrow up to $2.4 billion under our existing credit facilities, net of any outstanding letters of credit.
Regulatory Matters Towers and Antennas.
Our domestic and international tower business is subject to national, state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration, siting, construction, lighting, marking and maintenance of our towers. In the United States, which accounted for approximately 66% of our total rental and management revenue for the year ended December31, 2014, the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require pre-approval by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields. Towers requiring pre-approval must be registered with the FCC and maintained in accordance with FAA standards. Similar requirements regarding pre-approval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries. Non-compliance with applicable tower-related requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders.
Furthermore, in India, each of our subsidiaries holds an Infrastructure Provider Category-I license (IP-I) issued by the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885. As a condition to the IP-I, the Indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war. In Ghana, our subsidiary holds a Communications Infrastructure License, issued by the National Communications Authority (NCA), which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and DAS networks for communications service providers licensed by the NCA.While we are required to provide tower space on a non-discriminatory basis, we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers. In Chile, our subsidiary is classified as a Telecom Intermediate Service Provider. We have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the Chilean Subsecretaria de Telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in Chile.
Our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions. For example, in South Africa, the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, 2003 (the BBBEE Act) 7 Table of Contents has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of South African citizens disadvantaged by Apartheid. Accordingly, the BBBEE Act and related codes measure BBBEE Act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership, management control, employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there. In addition, certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers. Our foreign operations may be affected if a countrys regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership.
In all countries where we operate, we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations. While these regulations vary, they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities, which can delay or prevent new tower construction, new antenna installation or site upgrade projects, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand. In addition, zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction, tower modifications, and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades. Existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us. These factors could materially and adversely affect our construction activities and operations. In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of communications sites. It also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations. Further, in February 2012, the United States government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or collocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations.
Portions of our business are subject to additional regulations, for example, in a number of states throughout the United States, certain of our subsidiaries hold Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) or other status, in connection with the operation of our outdoor DAS networks business. In addition, we or our domestic and international tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites.
Environmental Matters.
Our domestic and international operations are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes and the siting of our towers. We may be required to obtain permits, pay additional property taxes, comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries, generators and fuel at our sites. Violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions.
Additionally, in the United States and many other international markets where we do business, before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site, we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment. If a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment, FCC or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed.
Health and Safety.
In the United States and in other countries where we operate, we are subject to various national, state and local laws regarding employee health and safety, including protection from radio frequency exposure.
8 Table of Contents Competition We compete, both for new business and for the acquisition of assets, with other public tower companies, such as Crown Castle International Corp., SBA Communications Corporation and GTL Infrastructure Limited, wireless carrier tower consortia such as Indus Towers and private tower companies, independent wireless carriers, tower owners, broadcasters and owners of non-communications sites, including rooftops, utility towers, water towers and other alternative structures. We believe that site location and capacity, network density, price, quality and speed of service have been, and will continue to be, significant competitive factors affecting owners, operators and managers of communications sites.
Our network development services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consultants, structural engineering firms, tower owners/managers, telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants personnel. We believe that our tenants base their decisions for network development services on various criteria, including a companys experience, local reputation, price and time for completion of a project.
Customer Demand Our strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage, quality and capacity of their networks in both our domestic and international markets, driving demand for our communications sites.
Domestic wireless network investments.
According to industry data, aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged over $30 billion over the past three years, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. Demand for our domestic communications sites is driven by:  Increasing wireless data usage, which continues to incentivize wireless service providers to focus on network quality and make incremental investments in the coverage and capacity of their networks;  Subscriber adoption of advanced wireless data applications such as mobile Internet and video, increasingly advanced devices and the corresponding deployments and densification of advanced networks by wireless service providers to satisfy this incremental demand for high-bandwidth wireless data;  Deployment of newly acquired spectrum; and  Deployment of wireless and backhaul networks by new market entrants.
As consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the United States grow, wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment, further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage.
International wireless network investments.
The wireless networks in most of our international markets are typically less advanced than those in our domestic market with respect to the density of voice networks and the current technologies generally deployed for wireless services. Accordingly, demand for our international communications sites is primarily driven by:  Incumbent wireless service providers investing in existing voice networks to improve or expand their coverage and increase capacity;  In certain of our international markets, increasing subscriber adoption of wireless data applications, such as email, Internet and video;  Spectrum auctions, which result in new market entrants, as well as initial and incremental data network deployments; and  The increasing availability of lower cost smartphones internationally.
9 Table of Contents We believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality, coverage area and capacity of their existing networks, while also investing in next generation data networks. To meet these network objectives, we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital, rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities. In addition, because our network development services are complementary to our rental and management business, we believe demand for our network development services will continue, consistent with industry trends.
Any increase in the use of network sharing, roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers could adversely affect customer demand for tower space. These arrangements enable a provider to serve its customers outside the providers license area, to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit non-licensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace. Consolidation among wireless carriers could similarly impact customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap. In addition, wireless carriers sharing their sites or permitting equipment location swapping on their sites with other carriers to a significant degree could reduce demand for our communications sites. Further, our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites.
In addition, our customer demand could be adversely affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies, which could make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks without the need for incremental cell sites. The increased use of spectrally efficient technologies or the availability of significant incremental spectrum in the marketplace could potentially relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity problems, and as a result, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space. Additionally, certain complementary network technologies, such as small cell deployments, could shift a portion of our tenants network investments away from the traditional tower-based networks, which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites.
Employees As of December31, 2014, we employed 2,974 full-time individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.

ITEM1A.
RISK FACTORS Decrease in demand for our communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results, and we cannot control that demand.
Factors affecting the demand for our communications sites and, to a lesser extent, our network development services, could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Those factors include:  increased use of network sharing without compensation to us, roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers;  mergers or consolidations among wireless service providers;  zoning, environmental, health or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof;  governmental licensing of spectrum or restricting or revoking spectrum licenses;  a decrease in consumer demand for wireless services due to general economic conditions or other factors, including inflation;  the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure;  the financial condition of wireless service providers;  delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies; and  technological changes.
Any downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit markets could impact consumer demand for wireless services.If wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use, or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications, our wireless service provider tenants could experience a decrease in demand for their services.As a result, our tenants may scale back their capital expenditure plans, which could materially and adversely affect leasing demand for our communications sites and our network development services business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
If our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
Extensive sharing of site infrastructure, roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites without compensation to us may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment, or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants networks may become redundant. In addition, significant consolidation among our tenants may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues. Certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks, and these and other tenants could determine not to renew leases with us as a result. Our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed.
Increasing competition for tenants in the tower industry may materially and adversely affect our pricing.
Our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space. Competitive pricing for tenants on towers from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates.
11 Table of Contents We may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases, or if we are able to renew or enter new leases, it may be at rates lower than our current rates, resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate. In addition, should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where the majority of our leases include fixed escalators, our income would be adversely affected. Increasing competition for tenants or significant increases in inflation rates could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria.
We may experience increased competition, which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly. Some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do, while other competitors may apply lower investment criteria than we do. In addition, we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets. Higher prices for assets could make it more difficult to achieve our return on investment criteria, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do.
Our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively, which could require that we modify or dismantle an existing tower. Zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction in their communities, which can delay, prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction, modifications, additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands and requirements. In addition, in certain foreign jurisdictions, we are required to pay annual license fees, and these fees may be subject to substantial increases by the government. Foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and currently are not required to pay license fees may enact license fees, which may apply retroactively. In certain foreign jurisdictions, there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location, which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes. Existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the associated timing or cost of construction projects associated with our communications sites and additional regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us, or that prevent such projects in certain locations. Furthermore, the tax laws, regulations and interpretations governing REITs may change at any time, perhaps with retroactive effect. In addition, some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other REITs due to the nature of our business and our use of TRSs. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Furthermore, some foreign jurisdictions have implemented regulations governing investment funds or their managers, which may be interpreted to apply to REITs, and there is uncertainty as to the interpretation and implementation of these regulations.
Our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us.
Our leverage could render us unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due with respect to, our indebtedness. We are also permitted, subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, to draw down on our credit facilities and obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs.
Our leverage could have significant negative consequences to our business, results of operations or financial condition, including:  impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if an uncured default occurs; 12 Table of Contents  increasing our borrowing costs if our current investment grade debt ratings decline;  placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquiring assets;  limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, thereby increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, REIT distributions and preferred stock dividends;  requiring us to issue debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete; and  limiting our ability to repurchase our common stock or make distributions to our stockholders.
In addition, to meet the REIT distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable, and the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. This would increase our total leverage.
Failure to successfully and efficiently integrate acquired or leased assets, including from the Proposed Verizon Transaction (the Verizon Assets), into our operations may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.
Integrating acquired portfolios of communications sites may require significant resources, as well as attention from our management team. In addition, we may incur certain non-recurring charges associated with the integration of acquired or leased assets or businesses into our operations. Further, the significant acquisition-related integration costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. For example, the integration of the Verizon Assets, which includes up to 11,489 towers, into our operations will be a significant undertaking, and we anticipate that we will incur certain non-recurring charges associated with the integration of the Verizon Assets into our operations, including costs for tasks such as tower visits and audits and ground and tenant lease verifications. Additional integration challenges include:  transitioning all data related to the Verizon Assets, tenants and landlords to a common information technology system;  successfully marketing space on the Verizon Assets;  successfully transitioning the ground lease rent payment and the tenant billing and collection processes;  retaining existing tenants on the Verizon Assets; and  maintaining our standards, controls, procedures and policies with respect to the Verizon Assets.
Additionally, we may fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity. If we are not able to meet these integration challenges, we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and businesses, including the Proposed Verizon Transaction, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.
13 Table of Contents Our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk.
As we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives, increased costs, assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions. Achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficiently integrating operations, communications tower portfolios and personnel. Integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among other things, differing systems and processes, cultural differences, customary business practices and conflicting policies, procedures and operations. In addition, integrating businesses may significantly burden management and internal resources, including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel.
Furthermore, our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described in the risk factor immediately below, some of which may require additional resources and personnel.
In addition, as a result of prior acquisitions, we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired. If the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made.
Our expansion initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. We anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:  changes to existing or new tax laws or methodologies impacting our international operations, or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications sites or our international acquisitions, any of which may be applied or enforced retroactively;  laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital;  changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions, including inflation or currency devaluation;  changes to zoning regulations or construction laws, which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications sites;  expropriation or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture;  actions restricting or revoking spectrum licenses or suspending or terminating business under prior licenses; 14 Table of Contents  failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-bribery laws, or Office of Foreign Assets Control requirements;  material site security issues;  significant license surcharges;  increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise), power and other goods and services required for our operations;  price setting or other similar laws for the sharing of passive infrastructure; and  uncertain or inconsistent laws, regulations, rulings or results from legal or judicial systems, which may be enforced retroactively, and delays in the judicial process.
We also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international business. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts. Our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies. We have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our non-U.S.Dollar operations, and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the U.S.Dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues, operating profits and income.
In our international operations, many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies. These subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities.
In addition, as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally, our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours, be in positions to take action contrary to our interests, policies or objectives, have competing interests in our, or other, markets that could create conflict of interest issues, withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments, any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs, including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture.
A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants.
A substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants. If any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under our agreements with it, our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In the ordinary course of our business, we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases. Historically, we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships. However, it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants or a material modification of the terms of those leases, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged, which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Due to the long-term nature of our tenant leases, we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants. Many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage. Sometimes our tenants, or their parent companies, face financial difficulty or file for bankruptcy.
In addition, many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures, which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets. If our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise 15 Table of Contents adequate capital to fund their business plans, they may reduce their spending, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our network development services business. If, as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, one or more of our significant tenants experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy, it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset, tower asset, network location intangible asset or customer-related intangible asset. The loss of significant tenants, or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
New technologies or changes in a tenants business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues.
The development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenants business model could reduce the need for tower-based wireless services, decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates. In addition, tenants may have less of their budgets allocated to lease space on our towers, as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies. Examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies, which could relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity needs and as a result, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space. Additionally, certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants network investments away from the traditional tower-based networks, which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites. Moreover, the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for tower-based broadcast services transmission and reception. Further, a tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model, which would result in a decrease in our revenue. The development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenants business model could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available.
Effective for the taxable year beginning January1, 2012, we began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply.
Qualification as a REIT requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. Further, tax reform proposals, if enacted, may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT or the benefits of remaining so qualified. There are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the Code.
If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Code:  we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;  we will be subject to federal and state income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates; and  we will be disqualified from REIT tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified.
Any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some 16 Table of Contents investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment, operations and distribution would be reduced.
Furthermore, as a result of our acquisition of MIP Tower Holdings LLC (MIPT), we own an interest in a subsidiary REIT. The subsidiary REIT is independently subject to, and must comply with, the same REIT requirements that we must satisfy in order to qualify as a REIT, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. If the subsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT, and certain relief provisions do not apply, then (i)the subsidiary REIT would become subject to federal income tax, (ii)the subsidiary REIT will be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which qualification was lost, (iii)our ownership of shares in such subsidiary REIT will cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75% gross income test and (iv)we may fail certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs, in which event we will fail to qualify as a REIT unless we are able to avail ourselves of specified relief provisions.
Complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.
Our use of TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities. Under the Code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and other non-qualifying assets. This limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy.
Specifically, this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or network development services segment as currently structured and operated, in other non-REIT qualifying operations or assets, or in international operations conducted through TRSs that we do not elect to bring into the REIT structure. Further, acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain REIT requirements prior to closing.
Further, as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of the REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). To meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. As no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other non-qualifying types of income, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our TRSs to fund other investments.
In addition, the majority of our income and cash flows from our TRSs are generated from our international operations. In many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the United States to help satisfy REIT distribution requirements.
Certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which reduce our cash flows and may create deferred and contingent tax liabilities.
We are subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including alternative minimum taxes, taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. Any of these taxes decrease our earnings and our available cash.
17 Table of Contents We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. The results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.
Our TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located.
We may need additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements.
To fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities, asset sales or equity issuances. We anticipate that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our REIT distribution requirements.Depending on market conditions, we may seek to raise capital through credit facilities or debt or equity offerings.An increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating. A downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund our capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives or satisfy our REIT distribution requirements.
If we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. A loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites, which can affect our rights to access and operate a site. From time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under towers, which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites. Further, for various reasons, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. A significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to operating leases, and the ground leases for these sites have a final expiration date of 2024 and beyond. Further, for various reasons, title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the United States. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
If we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from such towers will be eliminated.
Our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period, or we may choose, for business or other reasons, not to exercise our right to purchase such towers. In the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights, or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from such 18 Table of Contents towers. In the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of the acquisitions of a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition, compliance and integration costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our preferred stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT.
The agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. A failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us. If the borrowers were to default on any of the loans, the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets, in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets.
The agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders, and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. Additionally, our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. If these limits prevent us from satisfying our REIT distribution requirements, we could fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT. Even if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT, they may prevent us from distributing 100% of our REIT taxable income, making us subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts.
Further, reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to timely provide the required information, we would be in breach of these covenants. For more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above, please see Item7 of this Annual Report under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesFactors Affecting Sources of Liquidity and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Further, the terms of our preferred stock provide that, unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding preferred stock for all prior dividend periods, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock. A failure to pay dividends on both our preferred and our common stock might jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. For more information on the terms of our preferred stock, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated.
Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites. If a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health 19 Table of Contents risks to consumers, it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.
We could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws.
Our operations are subject to the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As the owner, lessee or operator of real property and facilities, we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation, removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, and for damages and costs relating to off-site migration of hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. We may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at third-party sites to which we sent waste for disposal, even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time. Many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements. We may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. The requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. In certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Our towers, data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage.
Our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, such as ice and wind storms, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as other unforeseen events, such as acts of terrorism. Any damage or destruction to our towers or data centers, or certain unforeseen events, may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants.
As part of our normal business activities, we rely on information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records. Our computer systems could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (including through cyber attack and data theft), usage errors, catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control. Although we have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place, if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised, degraded, damaged, or breached, or otherwise cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information (including information about our tenants or landlords), which could damage our reputation and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues.
While we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction for a major future event. Further, we carry business interruption insurance, but our insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenue, including from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the event. If we are unable to provide services to our tenants, it could lead to tenant loss, resulting in a corresponding material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

(3) We lease two office spaces that together occupy an aggregate of approximately 8,400 square feet.
In addition to the principal offices set forth above, we maintain offices in the geographic areas we serve through which we operate our tower leasing and services businesses, as well as an office through which we pursue international business development initiatives. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs.
As of December31, 2014, we owned and operated a portfolio of 75,594 communications sites in the United States, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Ghana, India, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and Uganda. In November 2014, we signed an agreement to acquire communications sites in Nigeria. See the table in Item7 of this Annual Report, under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExecutive Overview for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites. In addition, we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators in the United States, which are included in our domestic rental and management segment.
Domestic Rental and Management Segment . Our interests in our domestic communications sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, 21 Table of Contents easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. Pursuant to the loan agreement for the securitization transaction completed in March 2013 (the Securitization), 5,195 towers in the United States are subject to mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan as of December31, 2014. In addition, 1,517 property interests in the United States are subject to mortgages and deeds of trust to secure three separate classes of Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes (the Unison Notes) assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain legal entities from Unison Holdings LLC and Unison Site ManagementII, L.L.C. (the Unison Acquisition). In connection with our acquisition of MIPT, a private REIT and parent company to Global Tower Partners (GTP), we assumed approximately $1.49 billion principal amount of existing indebtedness under six series, consisting of eleven separate classes, of Secured Tower Revenue Notes issued by certain subsidiaries of GTP in several securitization transactions, of which we repaid one series, consisting of two classes, in August 2014 (the remaining notes, the GTP Notes). The GTP Notes are secured by, among other things, 2,845 towers and 1,035 property interests and other related assets.
A typical domestic tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. The principal types of our domestic towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole.
A guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground and can reach heights of up to 2,000 feet. A guyed tower site for a typical broadcast tower can consist of a tract of land of up to 20 acres.
A self-supporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1,000 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site for a typical wireless communications tower can consist of a tract of land of 10,000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2,500 square feet for a metropolitan site.
A monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can consist of a tract of land of fewer than 2,500 square feet.
International Rental and Management Segment . Our interests in our international communications sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by private or government entities. Our financings in Colombia and South Africa are secured by an aggregate of 5,220 towers.
A typical international tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure, backup or auxiliary power generators and batteries and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. The four principal types of our international towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice, monopole and rooftop. Guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole structures are similar to those in our domestic segment. Rooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas, where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable. Rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet.
Ground Leases.
Of the 75,164 towers in our portfolio as of December31, 2014, approximately 88% were located on land we lease. Typically, we seek to enter ground leases with terms of twenty to twenty-five years, which are comprised of initial terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods. As a result, approximately 70% of the ground agreements for our sites have a final expiration date of 2024 and beyond.
Tenants . Our tenants are primarily wireless service providers, broadcasters and other communications service providers. As of December31, 2014, our four top tenants by total revenue were AT&T Mobility (20%), Sprint Nextel (15%), Verizon Wireless (11%)and T-Mobile USA (10%). In general, our tenant leases have an initial non-cancellable term of ten years, with multiple renewal terms. As a result, approximately 71% of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2020 or beyond.
22 Table of Contents ITEM3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

As of February 13, 2015, we had 396,708,636 outstanding shares of common stock and 166 registered holders.
Dividends As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed and expect to continue to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs).
In May 2014 we issued the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and subsequently began paying dividends pursuant to the terms thereof. For more information on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, see Item7 of this Annual Report under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources.
The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
Since our conversion to a REIT in 2012, we have distributed an aggregate of approximately $1.3 billion to our common stockholders, including approximately $150.7 million paid in January 2015. These distributions are primarily taxed as ordinary income.
During the year ended December31, 2014, we declared the following cash distributions: Declaration Date Payment Date Record Date Distribution per share Aggregate Payment Amount (in millions) Common Stock March6, 2014 April25,2014 April10,2014 $ 0.32 $ 126.6 May21, 2014 July 16, 2014 June 17, 2014 $ 0.34 $ 134.6 September10, 2014 October7,2014 September23,2014 $ 0.36 $ 142.7 December2, 2014 January13,2015 December 16, 2014 $ 0.38 $ 150.7 Preferred Stock May21, 2014 August 15, 2014 August 1, 2014 $ 1.3563 $ 8.1 September10, 2014 November17,2014 November 1, 2014 $ 1.3125 $ 7.9 December2, 2014 February 16, 2015 February 1, 2015 $ 1.3125 $ 7.9 24 Table of Contents During the year ended December31, 2013, we declared and paid the following cash distributions: Declaration Date Payment Date Record Date Distribution per share Aggregate Payment Amount (in millions) Common Stock March 12, 2013 April25,2013 April 10, 2013 $ 0.26 $ 102.8 May 22, 2013 July 16, 2013 June 17, 2013 $ 0.27 $ 106.7 September 12, 2013 October7,2013 September23,2013 $ 0.28 $ 110.5 December 4, 2013 December31,2013 December16,2013 $ 0.29 $ 114.5 Performance Graph This performance graph is furnished and shall not be deemed filed with the SEC or subject to Section18 of the Exchange Act, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

For the year ended December31, 2010, there was no stock-based compensation expense included.
(2) For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, amount includes approximately $0.4 million, $0.6 million, $1.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. For the year ended December31, 2010, there was no stock-based compensation expense included.
(3) For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010, amount includes approximately $78.3 million, $66.6 million, $50.2 million, $45.1 million and $52.6 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense.
(4) For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010, amount includes unrealized foreign currency (losses) gains of approximately $(49.3) million, $(211.7) million, $(34.3) million, $(131.1) million and $4.8 million, respectively.
(5) Basic net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and any dilutive common share equivalents, including shares issuable (i)upon the vesting of restricted stock awards, (ii)upon exercise of stock options and (iii)upon conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Dilutive common share equivalents also include the dilutive impact of the ALLTEL transaction (see notes 16 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). We use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of the outstanding restricted stock awards and stock options and use the if-converted method to calculate the effect of the outstanding Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.
(6) For the purpose of this calculation, earnings consists of income from continuing operations before income taxes and income on equity method investments, as well as fixed charges (excluding interest capitalized and amortization of interest capitalized). Fixed charges consists of interest expensed and capitalized, amortization of debt discounts, premiums and related issuance costs and the component of rental expense associated with operating leases believed by management to be representative of the interest factor thereon.
(7) Balances have been revised to reflect purchase accounting measurement period adjustments.
(8) As of December31, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010, amount includes approximately $160.2 million, $152.9 million, $69.3 million, $42.2 million and $76.0 million, respectively, of restricted funds pledged as collateral to secure obligations and cash, the use of which is otherwise limited by contractual provisions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below.
Our continuing operations are reported in three segments: domestic rental and management, international rental and management and network development services. In evaluating operating performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the international rental and management segment also include Interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest, Income (loss) on equity method investments and Income tax benefit (provision).
Executive Overview We are a global independent owner, operator and developer of communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data and data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our rental and management operations, which accounted for approximately 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December31, 2014 and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment. Through our network development services, we offer tower-related services domestically, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites, including in connection with provider network upgrades. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
28 Table of Contents The following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, we owned or operated as of December31, 2014: Country Numberof Owned Sites Numberof Operated Sites(1) United States 21,722 7,164 International(2): Brazil 9,642 2,268 Chile 1,161 Colombia 2,884 706 Costa Rica 464 Germany 2,031 Ghana 2,049 India 12,999 Mexico 8,551 199 Peru 571 South Africa 1,918 Uganda 1,265 (1) All of the communications sites we operate are held pursuant to long-term capital leases, including those subject to purchase options.
(2) In September 2014, we completed the sale of the operations in Panama.
On February5, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement for the Proposed Verizon Transaction, pursuant to which we expect to acquire the exclusive right to lease, acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to 11,489 wireless communications sites in the United States for $5.056 billion in cash at closing, subject to certain conditions and limited adjustments.
The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial non-cancellable term of ten years, with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended December31, 2014 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December31, 2014, we expect to generate approximately $27 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, absent the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually based on a fixed escalation (approximately 3.0% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs.
The revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi-year contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however in some instances, a lease may be canceled upon the payment of a termination fee.
Revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations. During the year ended December31, 2014, loss of revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented approximately 1.5% of our rental and management operations revenues.
Rental and Management Operations Revenue Growth . Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower, ground space required by the tenant, remaining tower capacity and 29 Table of Contents tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased through tower augmentation.
The primary factors affecting the revenue growth in our domestic and international rental and management segments are:  Recurring organic revenue, which is revenue from tenant leases attributable to sites that existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period (legacy sites);  Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of cancellations;  New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our legacy sites; and  New revenue attributable to sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period (new sites).
We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. Our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, consistent with our signing of a definitive agreement for the Proposed Verizon Transaction, we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and in new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. In a majority of our international markets, revenue also includes the reimbursement of direct costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs.
Rental and Management Operations Organic Revenue Growth . Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. The following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth:  Domestic . As a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of bandwidth-intensive wireless data applications and advanced wireless devices, wireless service providers in the United States continue to invest in their wireless networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites. Growth in wireless data demand has driven wireless providers in the United States to deploy increasing levels of annual wireless capital investment and as a result, we have experienced strong demand for our communications sites.
Based on industry research and projections, we expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:  The deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect our tenants to continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.
Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing wireless networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their 30 Table of Contents existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage.
Wireless service providers are also investing in reinforcing their networks through incremental backhaul and the utilization of on-site generators, which typically results in additional equipment or space leased at the tower site, and incremental revenue.
Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their network as they seek to optimize their network configuration.
We have entered into holistic master lease agreements with three of our four largest tenants in the United States, which provide for consistent, long-term revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn. Typically, these agreements include built-in annual escalators, fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a pre-determined amount of equipment on certain of our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded. Our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.
International . As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development in order to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as MTN Group Limited, Telefnica S.A., Vodafone Group PLC and Bharti Airtel Limited. We believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.
In emerging markets such as Ghana, India and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas. In more developed urban locations within these markets, early-stage data network deployments are underway. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate.
In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are focused on third generation (3G)network build outs and augmentations, with select initial investments in fourth generation (4G)technology. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly, which mandates that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service.
Finally, in markets with more mature network technology such as Germany, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage. With a more mature customer base, higher smartphone penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity.
We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 46,700 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable, long-term growth.
31 Table of Contents Rental and Management Operations New Site Revenue Growth.
During the year ended December31, 2014, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 8,450 sites. In a majority of our international markets, the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio.
New Sites (Acquired or Constructed) 2014 2013 2012 Domestic 900 5,260 960 International(1) 7,550 7,810 7,850 (1) The majority of sites acquired or constructed in 2014 were in Brazil, India and Mexico; in 2013 were in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Mexico and South Africa; and in 2012 were in Brazil, Germany, India and Uganda.
Rental and Management Operations Expenses.
Direct operating expenses incurred by our domestic and international rental and management segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes, repairs and maintenance. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our domestic and international rental and management segments selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year.As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio.Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.
Network Development Services Segment Revenue Growth . As we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (Adjusted EBITDA), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT FFO) and Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO).
We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) on discontinued operations, net; Income (loss) on equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense.
NAREIT FFO is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends declared on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i)unconsolidated affiliates and (ii)noncontrolling interest.
32 Table of Contents We define AFFO as NAREIT FFO before (i)straight-line revenue and expense; (ii)stock-based compensation expense; (iii)the non-cash portion of our tax provision; (iv)non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v)amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi)other income (expense); (vii)gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii)other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix)unconsolidated affiliates and (x)noncontrolling interest, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures.
Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Neither NAREIT FFO nor AFFO represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1)each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments; (2)Adjusted EBITDA is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants; (3)Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4)each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (5)each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies.
Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the year ended December31, 2014, we raised capital, thereby increasing our financial flexibility and our ability to grow our business while reducing our leverage, consistent with our long-term financial policies. Our significant 2014 financing transactions included:  The completion of registered public offerings (i)through a reopening of the 3.40% Notes and a reopening of the 5.00% Notes, in aggregate principal amounts of $250.0 million and $500.0million, respectively and (ii)of the 3.450% Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $650.0million. We used the net proceeds from each offering to repay certain indebtedness under our existing credit facilities.
The completion of a registered public offering of 6,000,000 shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. We used the net proceeds of $582.9 million to fund acquisitions initially funded by indebtedness incurred under the 2013 Credit Facility.
The amendment and restatement of our 2012 Credit Facility, which, among other things, increased the commitments thereunder to $1.5 billion and extended the maturity date to January31, 2020.
As of December31, 2014, we had approximately $2.7 billion of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $313.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow up to $2.4 billion, net of outstanding letters of credit, under the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility.

Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repurchase our existing indebtedness from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions.
As of December31, 2014, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $14.6 billion, with a current portion of $897.6 million. During the year ended December31, 2014, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required REIT 46 Table of Contents distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December31, 2015, together with our increased borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and bridge loan commitment, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of December31, 2014, we had approximately $185.8 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $67.1 million was held by our joint ventures. Historically, it has not been our practice to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities increased $535.5 million as compared to the year ended December31, 2013. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the operating profit of our rental and management segments, cash provided by working capital and a decrease in restricted cash, partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest and taxes. Working capital was positively impacted by the receipt of capital contributions from tenants and a value added tax refund, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable.
For the year ended December31, 2013, cash provided by operating activities increased $184.7 million as compared to the year ended December31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the operating profit of our rental and management segments as compared to the year ended December31, 2012, partially offset by increases in Other SG&A and cash paid for interest and a decrease in cash provided by working capital. Working capital was positively impacted by the receipt of capital contributions from tenants and partially offset by an increase in prepaid assets.

2013 Credit Facility.
In June 2013, we entered into the 2013 Credit Facility. The 2013 Credit Facility has a term of five years and includes two optional one-year renewal periods. The current margin over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) that we incur on borrowings (should we choose LIBOR Advances) is 1.250% and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion is 0.150%.

We maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2013 Credit Facility in the ordinary course.
2013 Term Loan.

On September19, 2014, we entered into an amendment agreement with respect to the 2013 Term Loan, which (i)amended the limitation on indebtedness of, and guaranteed by, our subsidiaries to the greater of (x)$800.0 million and (y)50% of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the 2013 Term Loan) on a consolidated basis as of the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter and (ii)permitted indebtedness owed by certain of our subsidiaries to our joint venture partners.
The 2013 Term Loan matures on January3, 2019, and the current margin over LIBOR is 1.250%.
2014 Credit Facility.
On September19, 2014, we entered into the 2014 Credit Facility, which amended and restated the 2012 Credit Facility to, among other things, (i)increase the commitments thereunder to $1.5 billion, including a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit, (ii)extend the maturity date to January31, 2020, including up to two optional renewal periods, (iii)amend the limitation on indebtedness of, and guaranteed by, our subsidiaries to the greater of (x)$800.0 million and (y)50% of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the 2014 Credit Facility) on a consolidated basis as of the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter, (iv)permit indebtedness owed by certain of our subsidiaries to our joint venture partners and (v)add an expansion feature, which allows us to request up to an aggregate of $500.0 million in additional commitments upon satisfaction of certain conditions.
Amounts borrowed under the 2014 Credit Facility will bear interest, at our option, at a margin above LIBOR or the Base Rate. For LIBOR based borrowings, interest rates will range from 1.125% to 2.000% above LIBOR. For Base Rate borrowings, interest rates will range from 0.125% to 1.000% above the Base Rate. In each case, the applicable margin is based upon our debt ratings. In addition, the 2014 Credit Facility requires a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the commitments ranging from 0.125% to 0.400%per annum, based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR that we incur on borrowings is 1.250%, and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the commitments is 0.150%. The 2014 Credit Facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium.
The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply.

(13) Excludes $26.6 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $24.9 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
Interest Rate Swap Agreements . We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in Colombia and South Africa. All of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of $79.9 million, interest rates ranging from 5.74% to 7.83% and expiration dates through April 2021. In February 2014, we repaid the Costa Rica Loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap agreements. Additionally, in connection with entering into the Colombian Credit Facility in October 2014, we terminated our pre-existing interest rate 56 Table of Contents swap agreement and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with an aggregate notional value of 100.0 billion COP (approximately $41.8 million).
Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Our liquidity is dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investors understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity.
Internally Generated Funds . Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2014 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites.
Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities .The loan agreements for the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2013 Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to (i)total leverage, (ii)senior secured leverage and (iii)interest coverage, as set forth below. As of December31, 2014, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.
Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in the loan agreements) of 6.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December31, 2014, we could incur approximately $1.7 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $291million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. On February20, 2015, we entered into amendments to the 2013 Term Loan, 2013 Credit Facility and 2014 Credit Facility, pursuant to which this ratio will be increased upon the closing of the Proposed Verizon Transaction.
Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in the loan agreements) of 3.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December31, 2014, we could incur approximately $4.5 billion of additional Senior Secured Debt and still remain in compliance with the current ratio (effectively, however, this ratio would be limited to $1.7 billion to remain in compliance with other covenants). In addition, if we maintain our existing Senior Secured Debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $1.5 billion and we would still remain in compliance with the current ratio.
Interest Coverage Ratio: In the event our debt ratings fall below investment grade, we will be required to maintain a ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense (each as defined in the loan agreements) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December31, 2014, our interest expense, which was $549 million for that period, could increase by approximately $532 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $1.3 billion and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio.
57 Table of Contents The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.
Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but would constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.
Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the Securitization and the GTP Notes . The First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement related to the Securitization (the Loan Agreement) and indentures governing the GTP Notes (the GTP Indentures) include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (the Borrowers), and the GTP Issuers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the applicable GTP Indenture).
Under the terms of the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the nonrecourse loan relating to the Securitization (the Loan) or the GTP Notes (as applicable), which must be deposited, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the assets securing the Loan or the GTP Notes are released to the Borrowers or the applicable GTP Issuer, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. During the year ended December31, 2014, the Borrowers distributed excess cash to us of $715.7 million and the GTP Issuers have distributed excess cash to us of $164.1 million.
In order to distribute this excess cash flow to us, the Borrowers and the GTP Issuers must maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio (DSCR), calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the applicable GTP Indenture) to the amount of interest required to be paid over the succeeding twelve months on the principal amount of the Loan or the principal amount of the GTP Notes that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination, plus the amounts payable for trustee and servicing fees. If the DSCR with respect to the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013-2A issued in our Securitization (the Securities) or any series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Partners is equal to or below 1.30x (the Cash Trap DSCR) at the end of any calendar quarter and it continues for two consecutive calendar quarters, or if the DSCR with respect to any series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites is equal to or below the Cash Trap DSCR at the end of any calendar month and it continues for two consecutive calendar months, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required with respect to the particular series of Securities or GTP Notes under the Loan Agreement or GTP Indentures, as applicable, will be deposited into reserve accounts instead of being released to the Borrowers or the GTP Issuers. The funds in the reserve accounts will not be released to the Borrowers or GTP Partners for distribution to us unless the DSCR with respect to such series of Securities or GTP Notes exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Likewise, the funds in the reserve account will not be released to GTP Cellular Sites for distribution to us unless the DSCR with respect to such series of GTP Notes exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar months.
58 Table of Contents Additionally, an amortization period, commences as of the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the Securities and the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Partners, and as of the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites, if the DSCR of such series equals or falls below 1.15x (the Minimum DSCR). The amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the Securities and the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Partners for which the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Similarly, the amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites, for which the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar months.
If on the anticipated repayment date, the outstanding principal amount with respect to any series of the GTP Notes or the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Securities has not been paid in full, an amortization period will continue until such principal amount of the applicable series of GTP Notes or the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of Securities is repaid in full.
During an amortization period, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to pay principal of the applicable subclass of Securities or series of GTP Notes on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any subclass of the Securities or series of GTP Notes from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the Loan Agreement or the GTP Indentures, as applicable.
Consequently, a failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent the Borrowers or GTP Issuers from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, meet REIT distribution requirements, make Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock dividend payments and fund our stock repurchase program. If the Borrowers were to default on the Loan, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the 5,195 wireless and broadcast communications towers that secure the Loan (the Secured Towers), in which case we could lose the Secured Towers and the revenue associated with those towers. In addition, upon occurrence and during an event of default, the trustee may, in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of GTP Notes, declare such series of GTP Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such GTP Notes. Furthermore, if the GTP Issuers were to default on a series of the GTP Notes, the trustee may demand, collect, take possession of, receive, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the 2,845 towers and 1,035 property interests and other related assets that secure the GTP Notes (the GTP Secured Sites) securing such series of the GTP Notes, in which case we could lose the GTP Secured Sites and the revenue associated with those assets.
As of December31, 2014, the Borrowers DSCR was 10.22x. Based on the Borrowers net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended December31, 2014 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the Loan, the Borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately $428.6 million in net cash flow before triggering the Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $435.8 million in net cash flow before triggering the Minimum DSCR. As of December31, 2014, the DSCR of GTP Partners and GTP Cellular Sites were 2.88x and 2.54x, respectively. Based on the net cash flow of GTP Partners and GTP Cellular Sites for the calendar quarter ended December31, 2014 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the applicable series of GTP Notes, GTP Partners and GTP Cellular Sites could endure a reduction of approximately $68.7 million and $16.4 million, respectively, in net cash flow before triggering the Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $75.2 million and $18.4 million, respectively, in net cash flow before triggering the Minimum DSCR.
As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, in order to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, we may need to raise additional capital 59 Table of Contents through financing activities.If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, pay Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness.
In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item1A of this Annual Report under the caption Risk Factors, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December31, 2014. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.
Impairment of AssetsAssets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.
We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.
We review our customer-related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the customer-related intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows.
If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.
Impairment of AssetsGoodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
60 Table of Contents Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, managements expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess.
During the year ended December31, 2014, no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test. The fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount by a substantial margin.
Asset Retirement Obligations: When required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligations estimated settlement date.
We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $13.2 million during the year ended December31, 2014. The change in 2014 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary.
Acquisitions : For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition.
Revenue Recognition: Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is reasonably assured. Escalation clauses tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our 61 Table of Contents tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total rental and management straight-line revenues for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 approximated $123.7 million, $147.7 million and $165.8 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.
We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and approximately 56% of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing customer revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on managements estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenants inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.
Rent Expense: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured.
Stock-Based Compensation: The stock-based compensation expense recognized over the service period, which is generally the vesting period, is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited. The fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, the expected distributions, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and the compensation expense. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation in either selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets.
Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We do not expect to pay federal taxes on our REIT taxable income.
We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be 62 Table of Contents realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability.
We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in managements judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.
We consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the United States.

(b) Variable rate debt included the 2013 Term Loan ($1.5 billion), which matures on January3, 2019 and the 2014 Credit Facility ($1.1 billion), which matures on January31, 2020. Variable rate debt also included $118.7 million of indebtedness under the BR Towers Debentures, which amortize through October15, 2023, and $7.6 million of indebtedness under Sublimit A and Sublimit C under the BR Towers Credit Facility, which amortize through July15, 2020, $263.4 million of indebtedness under the Mexican Loan, which matures on May1, 2015, $69.0 million of indebtedness under the Uganda loan, which matures on June29, 2019, $75.1 million of indebtedness outstanding under the South African Facility, which amortizes through March31, 2020 and $83.6 million of indebtedness under the Colombian Credit Facility, which amortizes through April24, 2021. Interest on the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2013 Term Loan and the 2014 Credit Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The interest rate in effect at December31, 2014 for both the 2013 Term Loan and the 2014 Credit Facility was 1.41%. For the year ended December31, 2014, the weighted average interest rate under the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility and the 2013 Term Loan was 1.43%. The BR Towers Debentures bear interest at a rate of 7.40%, and any increase in the aggregate principal amount relative to changes in the National Extended Consumer Price Index will be capitalized pursuant to the Debenture Agreement. Interest on Sublimit A and Sublimit C under the BR Towers Credit Facility is payable in accordance with the Long-Term Interest Rate disclosed by the Central Bank of Brazil plus margin (as defined), which resulted in an interest rate of 10.80% and 5.90%, respectively, at December31, 2014. Interest on the Mexican Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable TIIE plus margin (as defined). The Mexican Loan accrued interest at 4.82% at December31, 2014. Interest on the Uganda loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR plus margin (as defined). The Uganda loan accrued interest at 5.84% at December31, 2014. Interest on the South African Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate (JIBAR) agreement and accrues at JIBAR plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate at December31, 2014, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in South Africa, was 10.34%. Interest on the Colombian Credit Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable Inter-bank Rate (IBR) agreement and accrues at IBR plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate at December31, 2014, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreement in Colombia, was 9.05%.
(c) Based on rates effective as of December31, 2014.
(d) Represents the weighted average fixed rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts.
We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in Colombia and South Africa. In connection with entering into the Colombian Credit Facility in October 64 Table of Contents 2014, we terminated our pre-existing interest rate swap agreement and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with an aggregate notional value of 100.0 billion COP (approximately $41.8 million). All of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of $79.9 million, interest rates ranging from 5.74% to 7.83% and expiration dates through April 2021.
Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December31, 2014, was comprised of $1,500.0 million under the 2013 Term Loan, $1,100.0 million under the 2014 Credit Facility, $263.4 million under the Mexican Loan, $118.7 million under the BR Towers Debentures, $69.0 million under the Uganda loan, $37.1 million under the South African Facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, $41.8 million under the Colombian Credit Facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements and $7.6 million under Sublimit A and Sublimit C under the BR Towers Credit Facility. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $7.0 million of interest expense for the year ended December31, 2014.
We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S.Dollar is reported in U.S.Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S.Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of AOCI. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations. For the year ended December31, 2014, approximately 33% of our revenues and approximately 39% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.
We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December31, 2014. As of December31, 2014, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by approximately 3%.
As of December31, 2014, we have incurred intercompany debt, which is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being of long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in approximately $18.5 million of unrealized gains or losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December31, 2014.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors.
65 Table of Contents Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2014 and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December31, 2014, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Deloitte& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on managements internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Item9A under the caption Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In October 2013, we acquired MIPT and, as permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC, we excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial reporting at MIPT for the year ended December31, 2013. We completed and integrated the controls of MIPT, which are included in our assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December31, 2014.
Other than as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
66 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of American Tower Corporation Boston, Massachusetts We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of American Tower Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December31, 2014 of the Company and our report dated February24, 2015, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

F-7 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business American Tower Corporation is, through its various subsidiaries (collectively, ATC or the Company), a global independent owner, operator and developer of communications real estate. The Companys primary business is the leasing of space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data and data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company also manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners, operates in-building and outdoor distributed antenna system (DAS) networks, holds property interests under third-party communications sites and provides network development services that primarily support its rental and management operations.
ATC is a holding company that conducts its operations through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and its joint ventures. ATCs principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. ATC conducts its international operations primarily through its subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The Company operates as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (REIT) and, therefore, is generally not subject to federal income taxes on its income and gains that it distributes to its stockholders, including the income derived from leasing space on its towers.However, even as a REIT, the Company remains obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from its taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs). In addition, the Companys international assets and operations, including those designated as direct or indirect qualified REIT subsidiaries or other disregarded entities of a REIT (collectively, QRSs), continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.
The use of TRSs enables the Company to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements. The Company may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs that hold certain of its operations to be treated as QRSs, and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from its TRSs to other subsidiaries, including QRSs. For all periods subsequent to the conversion from a TRS to a QRS, the Company includes the income from the QRS as part of its REIT taxable income for the purpose of computing its REIT distribution requirements. During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company restructured certain of its German subsidiaries and certain of its domestic TRSs, which included a portion of its network development services segment and indoor DAS networks business, to be treated as QRSs. As a result, as of December31, 2014, the Companys QRSs include its domestic tower leasing business, most of its operations in Costa Rica, Germany and Mexico and a portion of its network development services segment and indoor DAS networks business.
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in entities that the Company does not control are accounted for using the equity or cost method, depending upon the Companys ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Significant Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated F-8 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS financial statements include impairment of long-lived assets (including goodwill), asset retirement obligations, revenue recognition, rent expense, stock-based compensation, income taxes and accounting for business combinations. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued as additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure.
Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company is subject to concentrations of credit risk related to its cash and cash equivalents, notes receivable, accounts receivable, deferred rent asset and derivative financial instruments. The Company mitigates its risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments by maintaining its deposits and contracts at high quality financial institutions and monitoring the credit ratings of those institutions.
The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues, corresponding accounts receivable and the related deferred rent asset from a relatively small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and approximately 56% of its current year revenues are derived from four tenants. In addition, the Company has concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas.
The Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables and the related deferred rent assets by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of its borrowers and tenants. In recognizing customer revenue, the Company must assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized in advance of billing on a straight-line basis.
This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on managements estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as collectibility is determined to be reasonably assured. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Accounts receivable is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenants inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. These allowances are generally estimated based on payment patterns, days past due and collection history, and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends, such as tenants in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowances when they are determined to be uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account. Changes in the allowances were as follows for the years ended December31, (in thousands): 2014 2013 2012 Balance as of January1 $ 19,895 $ 20,406 $ 24,412 Current year increases 8,243 7,025 8,028 Write-offs, net of recoveries and other (10,832 ) (7,536 ) (12,034 ) Balance as of December31 $ 17,306 $ 19,895 $ 20,406 Functional Currency The functional currency of each of the Companys foreign operating subsidiaries is the respective local currency, except for Costa Rica, where the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. All foreign currency assets and liabilities held by the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate in F-9 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all foreign currency revenues and expenses are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reflected in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of comprehensive income.
Transactional gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are reflected in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. However, the effect from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany notes whose payment is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future is reflected in AOCI in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of comprehensive income. During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company recorded unrealized foreign currency losses of $468.6 million, of which $419.3 million was recorded in AOCI and $49.3 million was recorded in Other expense.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments, including money market funds, with remaining maturities of three months or less when acquired, whose cost approximates fair value.
Restricted Cash The Company classifies as restricted cash all cash pledged as collateral to secure obligations and all cash whose use is otherwise limited by contractual provisions, including cash on deposit in reserve accounts relating to the (i)Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013-2A issued in the Companys 2013 securitization transaction (the Securities), (ii)Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2010-1 Class C, Series 2010-2 Class C and Series 2010-2 Class F (collectively, the Unison Notes), assumed by the Company in connection with an acquisition and (iii)six series, consisting of eleven separate classes, of Secured Tower Revenue Notes, of which the Company repaid one series, consisting of two classes, in August 2014 (the remaining notes, the GTP Notes) assumed by the Company in connection with an acquisition.
Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consists of highly-liquid investments with original maturities in excess of three months.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost or, in the case of acquired properties, at estimated fair value on the date acquired. Cost for self-constructed towers includes direct materials and labor, capitalized interest and certain indirect costs associated with construction of the tower, such as transportation costs, employee benefits and payroll taxes.The Company begins the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period, which is the period during which costs are incurred to evaluate the site, and continues to capitalize costs until the tower is substantially completed and ready for occupancy by a tenant.Labor costs capitalized for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $48.5 million, $44.1 million and $41.6million, respectively.Interest costs capitalized for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $2.8 million, $1.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Augmentation and improvements that extend an assets useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.
Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives. Towers and related assets on leased land are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the corresponding ground lease, taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value.
Towers or assets acquired through capital leases are reflected in Property and equipment, net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment, network location intangibles and assets held under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not exceeding twenty years.
F-10 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company utilizes the two-step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and employs a discounted cash flow analysis. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, managements expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the Company conducts the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess.
During the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.
Intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from three to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Deferred Rent Asset The Companys deferred rent asset is associated with non-cancellable tenant leases that contain fixed escalation clauses over the terms of the applicable lease in which revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Notes Receivable and Other Non-Current Assets Notes receivable and other non-current assets primarily consists of prepaid ground lease assets, value added tax receivable, notes receivable from TV Azteca, long-term deposits, favorable leasehold interests and other non-current assets.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCI, as well as a component of comprehensive income, and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs.
The primary risk managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate protection agreements to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. The Companys credit risk exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform.
The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes.
F-11 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company may also enter into foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the risk of currency fluctuations. These transactions do not typically qualify for hedge accounting, and as a result, the associated gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.
Fair Value Measurements The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
Discount and Premium on Notes The Company amortizes the discounts and premiums on its notes using the effective interest method over the term of the obligation. Such amortization is reflected in Interest expense and Interest income, TV Azteca, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Asset Retirement Obligations When required, the Company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of its tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligations estimated settlement date. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion in the consolidated statements of operations. Adjustments are also made to the asset retirement obligation liability to reflect changes in the estimates of timing and amount of expected cash flows, with an offsetting adjustment made to the related tangible long-lived asset. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Companys aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates that approximate the Companys incremental borrowing rate.
Income Taxes As a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to federal income taxes on income and gains distributed to the Companys stockholders. However, the Company remains obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from domestic TRSs. In addition, the Companys international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or where those operations are conducted, including those designated as QRSs for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company periodically reviews its deferred tax assets, and records a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability.
The Company classifies uncertain tax positions as non-current income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the income tax provision and interest income from tax refunds as a component of Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.
F-12 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to items excluded from net income that are recorded as an adjustment to equity, net of tax. The Companys other comprehensive income (loss) is primarily comprised of changes in fair value of effective derivative cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and reclassification of unrealized losses on effective derivative cash flow hedges.
Treasury Stock The Company records repurchases of its common stock using the cost method, whereby the purchase price, including legal costs and commissions, is recorded in a contra equity account, Treasury stock. The equity accounts from which the shares were originally issued are not adjusted for any treasury stock purchases unless and until such time as the shares are formally retired or reissued. As part of the Companys conversion to a REIT, all treasury stock outstanding at the time was retired.
Distributions As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, the Company has distributed, and expects to continue to distribute all or substantially all of its REIT taxable income after taking into consideration its utilization of net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). During the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company declared regular cash distributions to its common stockholders of an aggregate of $554.6 million, or $1.40 per share, $434.5 million, or $1.10 per share, and $355.6 million, or $0.90 per share, respectively.
During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company declared an aggregate of $23.9 million, or $3.98 per share in cash distributions to its preferred stockholders.
The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Companys control, including the financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in the Companys existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, the Companys ability to utilize NOLs to offset the Companys distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.
Acquisitions For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, the Company applies the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Company continues to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition.
Revenue Recognition The Companys revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease agreements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective F-13 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS leases when collectibility is reasonably assured. Escalation clauses tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with the Companys tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total rental and management straight-line revenues for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 approximated $123.7 million, $147.7 million and $165.8million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.
Network development services revenues are derived under contracts or arrangements with customers that provide for billings either on a fixed price basis or a variable price basis, which includes factors such as time and expenses. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, and include estimates for percentage completed. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.
Rent Expense Many of the leases underlying the Companys tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable by the Company over time. In addition, certain of the Companys tenant leases require the Company to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. The Company calculates straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to the Company such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured.
Total rental and management straight-line ground rent expense for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 approximated $38.4 million, $29.7 million and $33.7 million, respectively. The Companys liability for straight-line ground rent expense is recorded in Other non-current liabilities. The Company records prepaid ground rent in Prepaid and other current assets and Notes receivable and other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets according to the anticipated period of benefit.
Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general and administrative expense consists of overhead expenses related to the Companys rental and management and services operations and corporate overhead costs not specifically allocable to any of the Companys individual business operations. Development expense consists of costs related to the Companys acquisition efforts, costs associated with new business initiatives and project cancellation costs.
Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The Companys Compensation Committee adopted a death, disability and retirement benefits program in connection with equity awards granted on or after January1, 2013 that provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employees death or permanent disability, or upon an employees qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, for grants made on or after January1, 2013, the Company recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation over the shorter of (i)the four-year vesting period or (ii)the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such retirement benefits, which may occur upon grant. The expense recognized over the service period includes an estimate of awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of the Companys common F-14 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in either Selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of the tower assets.
Litigation Costs The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business. The Company regularly monitors the status of pending legal actions to evaluate both the magnitude and likelihood of any potential loss. The Company accrues for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss, or possible range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies or litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those liabilities may be required. The Company also incurs legal costs in connection with these matters and records estimates of these expenses, which arereflected in Selling, general, administrativeand development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses includes the costs incurred by the Company in conjunction with acquisitions and mergers (including changes in estimated fair value of contingent consideration), impairments on long-lived assets and gains and losses recognized upon the disposal of long-lived assets and other discrete items of a non-recurring nature.
The Company reviews long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Companys assets may not be recoverable.
The Company reviews its tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its customer-related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered, either through projected undiscounted future cash flows or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company will measure any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the assets fair value, as compared to the assets carrying amount. The Company records any related impairment charge in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.
Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations Loss on retirement of long-term obligations primarily includes cash paid to retire debt in excess of its carrying value, non-cash charges related to the write-off of deferred financing fees, losses associated with the settlement of interest rate swaps and the write-off of any discounts or premiums. In 2014, Loss on retirement of long-term obligations includes amounts associated with the acquisition of BR Towers preferred equity.
Earnings Per Common Share  Basic and Diluted Basic net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and any dilutive common share equivalents, including shares issuable (i)upon the vesting of restricted stock awards, (ii)upon exercise of stock options and (iii)upon conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Dilutive common share equivalents also include the dilutive impact of the ALLTEL transaction. The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the effect F-15 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS of its outstanding restricted stock awards and stock options and uses the if-converted method to calculate the effect of its outstanding Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.
Retirement Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain age and employment requirements. For the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, the Company matched 75% of the first 6% of a participants contributions. The Companys matching contribution for the year ended December31, 2012 was 50% of the first 6% of a participants contributions. For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company contributed approximately $6.5 million, $6.0 million and $4.4 million to the plan, respectively.
Accounting Standards Updates In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued additional guidance on reporting discontinued operations. Under this guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations would be presented as discontinued operations. This guidance requires expanded disclosure that provides information about the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of discontinued operations. Additionally, the guidance requires additional disclosure for a disposal of a significant part of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after December15, 2014, with early adoption permitted for disposals or classifications of assets as held-for-sale that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. The Company chose to early adopt this guidance during the year ended December31, 2014 and the adoption did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance, which requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP and will become effective on January1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method, and leases are not included in the scope of this standard. The Company is evaluating the impact this standard may have on its financial statements.

(2) Acquired network location intangibles are amortized over the shorter of the term of the corresponding ground lease taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value or up to 20 years, as the Company considers these intangibles to be directly related to the tower assets.
(3) Deferred financing costs are amortized over the term of the respective debt instruments to which they relate using the effective interest method. This amortization is included in Interest expense, rather than in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense.
The acquired network location intangibles represent the value to the Company of the incremental revenue growth which could potentially be obtained from leasing the excess capacity on acquired communications sites. The acquired customer-related intangibles typically represent the value to the Company of customer contracts and relationships in place at the time of an acquisition, including assumptions regarding estimated renewals.
F-18 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company amortizes its acquired network location intangibles and customer-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. As of December31, 2014, the remaining weighted average amortization period of the Companys intangible assets, excluding deferred financing costs and the TV Azteca Economic Rights detailed in note 5, is approximately 15 years. Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 aggregated approximately $411.7 million, $282.5 million and $207.3million, respectively. Amortization expense excludes amortization of deferred financing costs, which is included in Interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Based on current exchange rates, the Company expects to record amortization expense (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) as follows over the next five subsequent years (in millions): Year Ending December31, 2015 $ 430.8 2016 424.4 2017 422.7 2018 421.8 2019 419.9 5.NOTES RECEIVABLE AND OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS Notes receivable and other non-current assets consists of the following as of December31, (in thousands): 2014 2013 (1) Long-term prepaid ground rent $ 310,232 $ 217,983 Notes receivable 87,515 89,381 Other miscellaneous assets 168,707 201,809 Balance as of December31, $ 566,454 $ 509,173 (1) December31, 2013 balances have been revised to reflect purchase accounting measurement period adjustments.
TV Azteca Note Receivable In 2000, the Company loaned TV Azteca, S.A. de C.V. (TV Azteca), the owner of a major national television network in Mexico, $119.8 million. The loan has an interest rate of 13.11%, payable quarterly, which at the time of issuance was determined to be below market and therefore a corresponding discount was recorded. The term of the loan is seventy years; however, the loan may be prepaid by TV Azteca without penalty during the last fifty years of the agreement. The discount on the loan is being amortized to Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense on the Companys consolidated statements of operations, using the effective interest method over the seventy-year term of the loan.
During the year ended December31, 2013, TV Azteca made a payment of $34.4 million, which included $28.0million of principal on the loan, related interest and a prepayment penalty of $4.9 million in accordance with the terms of the agreement. In addition during the year ended December31, 2013, the Company recorded additional interest income of $2.7 million related to the write-off of a portion of the unamortized discount associated with the original loan. As of December31, 2014, the outstanding balance on the loan is $91.8 million, or $82.9 million, net of discount.
TV Azteca Economic Rights Simultaneous with the signing of the loan agreement, the Company also entered into a seventy-year Economic Rights Agreement with TV Azteca regarding space not used by TV Azteca on approximately 190 of its broadcast towers. In exchange for the issuance of the below market interest rate loan F-19 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS and the annual payment of $1.5 million to TV Azteca (under the Economic Rights Agreement), the Company has the right to market and lease the unused tower space on the broadcast towers (the Economic Rights). TV Azteca retains title to these towers and is responsible for their operation and maintenance. The Company is entitled to 100% of the revenues generated from leases with tenants on the unused space and is responsible for any incremental operating expenses associated with those tenants.
The term of the Economic Rights Agreement is seventy years; however, TV Azteca has the right to purchase, at fair market value, the Economic Rights from the Company at any time during the last fifty years of the agreement. Should TV Azteca elect to purchase the Economic Rights, in whole or in part, it would also be obligated to repay a proportional amount of the loan discussed above at the time of such election. The Companys obligation to pay TV Azteca $1.5 million annually would also be reduced proportionally.
The Company accounted for the annual payment of $1.5 million as a capital lease by initially recording an asset and a corresponding liability of approximately $18.6 million. The capital lease asset also includes the original discount on the note. The capital lease asset and original discount on the note aggregated approximately $30.2million at the time of the transaction and represents the cost to acquire the Economic Rights. The Economic Rights asset is recorded as an intangible asset and is being amortized over the seventy-year life of the Economic Rights Agreement.
6.ACQUISITIONS All of the acquisitions described below are accounted for as business combinations and are consistent with the Companys strategy to expand in selected geographic areas.
The estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the applicable acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the particular acquisition date). The primary areas of the accounting for the acquisitions that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, and residual goodwill and any related tax impact. The fair value of these net assets acquired are based on managements estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. While the Company believes that such preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, it will evaluate any necessary information prior to finalization of the fair value. During the measurement period, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of that date. The effect of measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair value is reflected as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date. The impact of all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could be subject to a possible impairment of the intangible assets or goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of intangible assets in subsequent periods. During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company made certain measurement period adjustments related to several acquisitions consummated in 2013 and therefore retrospectively adjusted the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2013.
Impact of current year acquisitions The Company typically acquires communications sites from wireless carriers or other tower operators and subsequently integrates those sites into its existing portfolio of communications sites. The financial results of the Companys acquisitions have been included in the Companys F-20 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December31, 2014 from the date of the respective acquisition. The date of acquisition, and by extension the point at which the Company begins to recognize the results of an acquisition, may be dependent upon, among other things, the receipt of contractual consents, the commencement and extent of leasing arrangements and the timing of the transfer of title or rights to the assets, which may be accomplished in phases. Sites acquired from communications service providers may never have been operated as a business and may have been utilized solely by the seller as a component of its network infrastructure. An acquisition, depending on its size and nature, may or may not involve the transfer of business operations or employees.
The estimated aggregate impact of the 2014 acquisitions on the Companys revenues and gross margin for the year ended December31, 2014 is approximately $47.0 million and $37.6 million, respectively. The revenues and gross margin amounts also reflect incremental revenues from the addition of new tenants to the acquired sites subsequent to the date of acquisition. Incremental amounts of segment selling, general, administrative and development expense have not been reflected as the amounts attributable to acquisitions are not comparable.
The Company recognizes acquisition and merger related costs in the period in which they are incurred and services are received. Acquisition and merger related costs may include finders fees, advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration and general administrative costs directly related to the transaction, and are included in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized acquisition and merger related expenses of $27.0 million, $36.2 million and $25.6 million, respectively. In addition, during the years ended December31, 2014 and December31, 2013, the Company recorded $13.1 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of integration costs related to recently closed acquisitions.
2014 Acquisitions BR Towers Acquisition On November19, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of BR Towers S.A., a Brazilian telecommunications real estate company (BR Towers). At closing, BR Towers owned 2,504 towers and four property interests, as well as the exclusive use rights for 2,113 additional towers and 43 property interests in Brazil. The Company completed the acquisition for an estimated preliminary purchase price of approximately $568.9 million and paid approximately $61.1 million to acquire all outstanding preferred equity. In addition, the Company assumed approximately $261.1 million of BR Towers existing indebtedness and repaid approximately $122.1 million of principal balance subsequent to closing. The purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustments.
Richland Acquisition On April3, 2014, the Company, through one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired entities holding a portfolio of 59 communications sites, which at the time of acquisition were leased primarily to radio and television broadcast tenants, and four property interests in the United States from Richland Properties LLC and other related entities (Richland) for a purchase price of $189.4 million, which includes approximately $6.5 million payable to the seller upon satisfaction of certain closing conditions. In addition, the Company assumed $196.5 million of Richlands existing indebtedness. In June 2014, the Company repaid the outstanding indebtedness, paid prepayment consideration and wrote-off the unamortized premium associated with the fair value adjustment.The purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustments.
Other International Acquisitions During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company acquired a total of 159 communications sites and related assets in Brazil, Ghana, Mexico and Uganda, for total purchase price of $28.3 million (including value added tax of $1.2 million). The Company also acquired 299 communications sites in Mexico for a purchase price of $40.3 million (including value added tax of $5.6 million), which reflects approximately $3.4 million of net liabilities assumed. Total purchase price was satisfied by the issuance of approximately $36.3 million of credits to be applied against trade accounts receivable and cash consideration of approximately $4.0 million.
F-21 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other U.S. Acquisitions During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company acquired a total of 184 communications sites and equipment, as well as six property interests, in the United States for total purchase price of $180.8 million (including $6.3 million for the estimated fair value of contingent consideration).

Pro Forma Consolidated Results The following table presents the unaudited pro forma financial results as if the 2014 acquisitions had occurred on January1, 2013 and the 2013 acquisitions had occurred on January1, 2012 (in thousands, except per share data). Management relied on various estimates and assumptions due to the fact that some of the acquisitions never operated as a business and were utilized solely by the seller as a component of their network infrastructure. As a result, historical operating results for these acquisitions are not available. The pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost synergies, costs or other effects of the planned integration of the acquisitions. Accordingly, such pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results that actually would have occurred had the acquisitions been completed on the dates indicated, nor are they indicative of the future operating results of the Company.
Year Ended December31, 2014 2013 Pro forma revenues $ 4,193,067 $ 3,848,549 Pro forma net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders $ 770,871 $ 394,253 Pro forma net income per common share amounts: Basic net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders $ 1.95 $ 1.00 Diluted net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders $ 1.93 $ 0.99 F-25 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other Signed Acquisitions TIM Acquisition On November21, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with TIM Celular S.A.

Acquisition-Related Contingent Consideration The Company may be required to pay additional consideration under certain agreements for the acquisition of communications sites if specific conditions are met or events occur.
Colombia Under the terms of the agreement with Colombia Movil S.A. E.S.P., the Company is required to make additional payments upon the conversion of certain barter agreements with other wireless carriers to cash paying lease agreements. Based on current estimates, the Company expects the value of potential contingent consideration payments required to be made under the agreement to be between zero and $29.5 million, based on current exchange rates, and estimates it to be $19.7 million using a probability weighted average of the expected outcomes as of December31, 2014. During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company recorded an increase in fair value of $1.4 million in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Ghana Under the terms of its agreement, as amended, with MTN Group Limited, the Company is required to make additional payments upon the conversion of certain barter agreements with other wireless carriers to cash paying lease agreements. Based on current estimates, the Company expects the value of potential contingent consideration payments required to be made under the amended agreement to be between zero and $0.6 million, based on current exchange rates, and estimates it to be $0.6 million using a probability weighted average of the expected outcomes as of December31, 2014.
MIPT In connection with the acquisition of MIPT, the Company assumed additional contingent consideration liability related to previously closed acquisitions in Costa Rica, Panama and the United States. The Company is required to make additional payments to the sellers if certain pre-designated tenant leases commence during a limited specified period of time after the applicable acquisition was completed, generally one year or less. The Company initially recorded $9.3 million of contingent consideration liability as part of the preliminary F-26 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS acquisition accounting upon closing of the acquisition. Based on current estimates, the Company expects the value of potential contingent consideration payments required to be made under these agreements to be between zero and $4.4 million. During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company (i)recorded a decrease in fair value of $1.7 million in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, (ii)recorded settlements under these agreements of $3.5 million, (iii)reduced its contingent consideration liability by $0.7 million as a portion of the Companys obligations was assumed by the buyer in conjunction with the sale of operations in Panama and (iv)recorded additional liability of $0.1 million. As a result, the Company estimates the value of potential contingent consideration payments required under these agreements to be $2.3million using a probability weighted average of the expected outcomes as of December31, 2014.
Other U.S.
In connection with other acquisitions in the United States, the Company is required to make additional payments if certain pre-designated tenant leases commence during a specified period of time. During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company recorded $6.3 million of contingent consideration liability as part of the preliminary acquisition accounting upon closing of certain acquisitions. During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company recorded settlements under these agreements of $0.4 million.

American Tower Subsidiary Debt Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013-2A InMarch2013, the Company completed a securitization transaction (the Securitization) involving assets related to 5,195 wireless and broadcast communications towers (the Secured Towers) owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the Company, through a private offering of $1.8 billion of the Securities. The net proceeds of the transaction were $1.78 billion. The Securities were issued by American Tower Trust I (the Trust), a trust established by American Tower Depositor Sub, LLC, an indirect wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of the Company.The assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan (the Loan) to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (the Borrowers), pursuant to a First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March15, 2013 (the Loan Agreement).The Borrowers are special purpose entities formed solely for the purpose of holding the Secured Towers subject to a securitization.
The Securities were issued in two separate series of the same class pursuant to a First Amended and Restated Trust and Servicing Agreement (the Trust Agreement), with terms identical to the Loan.The effective weighted average life and interest rate of the Securities is 8.6years and 2.648%, respectively, as of the date of issuance.
Amounts due under the Loan will be paid by the Borrowers from the cash flows generated by the Secured Towers.These funds in turn will be used by or on behalf of the Trust to service the payment of interest on the Securities and for any other payments required by the Loan Agreement or Trust Agreement.The Borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the Loan. Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be made prior to March15, 2018, which is the anticipated repayment date for the component of the Loan associated with the Series 2013-1A Securities. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the Loan Agreement and Trust Agreement, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the Secured Towers are released to the Borrowers, and can then be distributed to, and used by, the Company. However, if the debt service coverage ratio (the DSCR), generally defined as the net cash flow divided by the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months on the principal amount of the Loan, as of the last day F-29 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS of any calendar quarter prior to the applicable anticipated repayment date, were equal to or below 1.30x (the Cash Trap DSCR) for such quarter, and the DSCR continues to be equal to or below the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. An amortization period commences if (i)as of the end of any calendar quarter the DSCR equals or falls below 1.15x (the Minimum DSCR) for such calendar quarter and such amortization period will continue to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters or (ii)on the anticipated repayment date the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Securities has not been repaid in full, provided that such amortization period shall apply with respect to such component that has not been repaid in full. During an amortization period all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to payment of the principal on the Loan.
The Borrowers may prepay the Loan in whole or in part at any time provided it is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration.If the prepayment occurs within twelve months of the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2013-1A Securities or eighteen months of the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2013-2A Securities, no prepayment consideration is due. The entire unpaid principal balance of the component of the Loan related to the Series 2013-1A Securities and the Series 2013-2A Securities has a final maturity date of March 2043 and March 2048, respectively. The Loan may be defeased in whole at any time prior to the anticipated repayment date for any component of the Loan then outstanding.
The Loan is secured by (1)mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Secured Towers, (2)a pledge of the Borrowers operating cash flows from the Secured Towers, (3)a security interest in substantially all of the Borrowers personal property and fixtures and (4)the Borrowers rights under the tenant leases and the management agreement entered into in connection with the Securitization. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the Borrowers, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC, whose only material asset is its equity interest in American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, each have guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations. American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC, American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, the Depositor and the Borrowers each were formed as special purpose entities solely for purposes of entering a securitization transaction, and the assets and credit of these entities are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of the Company or any other person, except as set forth in the Loan Agreement.
The Loan Agreement includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement). The organizational documents of the Borrowers contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that the Borrowers maintain at least two independent directors.The Loan Agreement also contains certain covenants that require the Borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Loan Agreement and other agreements related to the Secured Towers, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the Secured Towers, including the right to conduct site investigations.
A failure to comply with the covenants in the Loan Agreement could prevent the Borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the Secured Towers, and could prevent the Borrowers from distributing any excess cash F-30 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS from the operation of the Secured Towers to the Company. If the Borrowers were to default on the Loan, the servicer could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the Secured Towers, in which case the Company could lose the Secured Towers and the revenue associated with those assets.
Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums, and to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Secured Towers. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement, all rental cash receipts received for each month are reserved for the succeeding month and held in an account controlled by the trustee and then released. The $118.8 million held in the reserve accounts as of December31, 2014 was classified as Restricted cash on the Companys accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
GTP Notes In connection with the acquisition of MIPT, the Company assumed approximately $1.49 billion principal amount of existing indebtedness issued by certain subsidiaries of GTP in several securitization transactions. GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (GTP Partners) issued the Series 2011-1 notes, Series 2011-2 notes and Series 2013-1 notes, and GTP Cellular Sites, LLC (GTP Cellular Sites, and together with GTP Partners, the GTP Issuers) issued the Series 2012-1 notes and Series 2012-2 notes.
In August 2014, the Company repaid in full the aggregate principal amount outstanding of $250.0 million under the Series 2010-1 Class C Notes and the Series 2010-1 Class F Notes issued by GTP Towers Issuer, LLC (together, the Series 2010-1 Notes) and wrote-off the unamortized premium associated with the fair value adjustment. As a result, the Company recorded a gain on retirement of long-term obligations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations of $3.0 million.

The GTP Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time beginning two years after the date of issuance, provided such payment is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within one year of the anticipated repayment date, no prepayment consideration is due.
As of December31, 2014, the GTP Notes are secured by, among other things, an aggregate of 2,845 sites and 1,035 property interests owned by subsidiaries of the GTP Issuers and other related assets (the GTP Secured Sites).
Cash flows generated by the GTP Secured Sites will be used to pay amounts due under the applicable series of GTP Notes, including the payment of interest on the applicable series of GTP Notes and for any other payments required by the indentures governing the GTP Notes (the GTP Indentures).
F-31 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the GTP Indentures, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the GTP Secured Sites are released to the GTP Issuers, and can then be distributed to, and used by, the Company. The GTP Issuers must maintain a specified ratio with respect to their DSCR, calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable GTP Indentures) to the amount of interest required to be paid over the succeeding twelve months on the principal amount of the GTP Notes that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination, plus the amounts payable for trustee and servicing fees. If the DSCR with respect to any series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Partners is equal to or below the Cash Trap DSCR at the end of any calendar quarter and it continues for two consecutive calendar quarters, or if the DSCR with respect to any series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites is equal to or below the Cash Trap DSCR at the end of any calendar month and it continues for two consecutive calendar months, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required with respect to such series of GTP Notes under the GTP Indentures, will be deposited into reserve accounts instead of being released to the GTP Issuers. The funds in the reserve accounts will not be released to GTP Partners for distribution to the Company unless the DSCR with respect to such series of GTP Notes exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Likewise, the funds in the reserve account will not be released to GTP Cellular Sites for distribution to the Company unless the DSCR with respect to such series of GTP Notes exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar months.
Additionally, an amortization period commences as of the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Partners, and as of the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites, if the DSCR of such series equals or falls below the Minimum DSCR. The amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Partners, for which the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. With respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites, the amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar month for which the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar months. During an amortization period all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to payment of the principal of the applicable series of GTP Notes.
The GTP Indentures include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for note offerings subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the GTP Issuers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary exceptions for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the GTP Indentures). The GTP Indentures also contain certain covenants that require the GTP Issuers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports, operating budgets and budgets for capital improvements not included in annual financial statements in accordance with GAAP, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the GTP Indentures and other agreements related to the GTP Secured Sites, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the GTP Secured Sites, including the right to conduct site investigations.
A failure to comply with the covenants in the GTP Indentures could prevent the GTP Issuers from taking certain actions with respect to the GTP Secured Sites and could prevent the GTP Issuers from distributing excess cash flow to the Company. In addition, upon occurrence and during an event of default, the trustee may, in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of GTP Notes, declare such series of GTP Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such GTP Notes. Furthermore, if the GTP Issuers were to default on a series of the GTP Notes, the trustee may demand, collect, take possession of, receive, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the GTP Secured Sites securing such series, in which case the GTP Issuers could lose the GTP Secured Sites and the revenue associated with those assets.
F-32 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Under the GTP Indentures, the GTP Issuers are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for amounts received or due from tenants related to future periods, property taxes, insurance, ground rents, certain expenses and debt service. The $20.9 million held in the reserve accounts as of December31, 2014 is classified as Restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
BR Towers Debt In connection with the acquisition of BR Towers, the Company assumed approximately 671.5million BRL (approximately $261.1 million based on exchange rates at the date of closing) aggregate principal amount of existing indebtedness consisting of (i)323.4million of BRL denominated privately issued simple debentures (BR Towers Private Debentures) (with an original principal amount of 330.0million BRL), (ii)313.1million BRL of denominated publicly issued simple debentures (BR Towers Debentures) (with an original principal amount of 300.0million BRL) issued by a subsidiary of BR Towers (the BRT Issuer), and (iii)a BRL denominated credit facility with Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social, which allows a subsidiary of BR Towers (the BRT Borrower) to borrow up to 48.1million BRL through an intermediary bank (the BR Towers Credit Facility).
On December11, 2014, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the BR Towers Private Debentures, which included a prepayment penalty of 3.2million BRL (approximately $1.2million on the date of repayment).
The BR Towers Debentures were issued on October15, 2013, and have a maturity date of October15, 2023. The BR Towers Debentures bear interest at a rate of 7.40%. The aggregate principal amount of the BR Towers Debentures may be adjusted periodically relative to changes in the National Extended Consumer Price Index. Any such increase in the principal amount will be capitalized in a manner consistent with the agreement governing the BR Towers Debentures (the Debenture Agreement). Payments of principal and interest are made quarterly, beginning on January15, 2014, in accordance with the amortization schedule set forth in the Debenture Agreement.
The Company may redeem the BR Towers Debentures beginning on October15, 2018 at the then outstanding principal amount plus a surcharge, calculated in accordance with the Debenture Agreement, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. As of December31, 2014, 315.3million BRL (approximately $118.7 million) aggregate principal amount is outstanding under the BR Towers Debentures.
The BR Towers Debentures are secured by (i)100% of the shares of the BRT Issuer and (ii)all proceeds and rights from the issuance of the BR Towers Debentures, including amounts in a Resource Account (as defined in the applicable agreement). The Debenture Agreement includes contractual covenants and other restrictions customary for public debentures. Among other things, the Debenture Agreement requires that (i)the BRT Issuer maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.10, (ii)the risk rating of the BR Towers Debentures not be downgraded by two or more notches, (iii)the BRT Issuer meet certain conditions to distribute dividends or interest on the issuers own capital, (iv)the issuer not incur additional indebtedness in an aggregate amount greater than 5.0million BRL (which amount is subject to adjustment as set forth in the agreement) and (v)the issuer maintain a leverage index (as defined in the Debenture Agreement) of at least 30%.
The BR Towers Credit Facility consists of three sublimits, the material terms of which are as follows: Maximum Borrowing Amount (BRL, in millions) Maturity Date InterestRateas of December31,2014 Sublimit A 20.2BRL($7.6USD) July15,2020 10.80 %(1) Sublimit B 27.6BRL($10.4USD) January15,2022 3.50 % Sublimit C 0.2 BRL ($0.1 USD) July 15, 2020 5.90 %(1) (1) Sublimit A and Sublimit C accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to 4.80% plus 1.00% and 0.90%, respectively, above the Long-Term Interest Rates disclosed by the Central Bank of Brazil (the LTIR). If the LTIR exceeds 6.00%, the amount of interest payable on the portion of the LTIR exceeding 6.00% will be capitalized in a manner pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement.
F-33 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of December31, 2014, 43.5million BRL (approximately $16.4 million) is outstanding under the BR Towers Credit Facility and the BRT Borrower maintains the ability to draw down the remaining 4.6million BRL (approximately $1.7 million) until June26, 2015. The BRT Borrower is required to pay a fee on any amount that remains undrawn at such date, which fee will be equal to a monthly charge of 0.1% of the undrawn portion of the loan, calculated from January15, 2014.
Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the BR Towers Credit Facility will be due and payable in full at maturity. The BR Towers Credit Facility may be prepaid in whole or in part, subject to certain limitations and prepayment consideration, at any time. Interest on the BR Towers Credit Facility is payable quarterly until the first amortization date, August15, 2015, after which time principal and interest payments will be made on a monthly basis.
The BR Towers Credit Facility is secured by the conditional assignment of receivables. The loan agreements include certain reporting, information, financial ratios and operating covenants. Failure to comply with certain of the financial and operating covenants would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.
Unison Notes In connection with the acquisition of Unison, the Company assumed $196.0 million of existing indebtedness with an acquisition date fair value of $209.3 million under the Unison Notes issued by Unison Ground Lease Funding, LLC (the Unison Issuer) in a securitization transaction (the Unison Securitization). The three classes of Unison Notes bear interest at rates of 5.349%, 6.392% and 9.522%, respectively, with anticipated repayment dates of April15, 2017,April15, 2020 and April15, 2020, respectively, and a final maturity date of April15, 2040.
The Unison Notes are secured by, among other things, liens on approximately 1,517 real property interests owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the Unison Issuer (together with the Unison Issuer, the Unison Obligors) and other related assets. The indenture for the Unison Notes (the Unison Indenture) includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for notes subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Unison Obligors are restricted from incurring other indebtedness or further encumbering their assets.
Under the terms of the Unison Indenture, the Unison Notes will be paid from the cash flows generated by the communications sites subject to the Unison Securitization. The Unison Issuer is required to make monthly payments of interest to holders of the Unison Notes. On a monthly basis, cash flows in excess of amounts needed to make debt service payments and other payments required under the Unison Indenture are to be distributed to the Unison Issuer, which may then be distributed to, and used by, the Company. The Unison Issuer may prepay the Unison Notes in whole or in part at any time, provided such payment is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within six months of the anticipated repayment date, no prepayment consideration is due.
A failure to comply with the covenants in the Unison Indenture could prevent the Unison Obligors from taking certain actions with respect to the property interests subject to the Unison Securitization and a failure to meet certain financial ratio tests could prevent excess cash flow from being distributed to the Unison Issuer. In addition, if the Unison Issuer were to default on the Unison Notes, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon the property interests subject to the Unison Securitization, in which case the Company could lose ownership of the property interests and the revenue associated with those property interests.
Mexican Loan In connection with the acquisition of towers in Mexico from NII during the fourth quarter of 2013, one of the Companys Mexican subsidiaries entered into a 5.2 billion MXN denominated unsecured bridge F-34 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS loan (the Mexican Loan) and subsequently borrowed approximately 4.9 billion MXN (approximately $374.7 million at the date of borrowing). The Mexican subsidiarys ability to further draw under the Mexican Loan expired in February 2014. The Mexican Loan bears interest at a margin over the Equilibrium Interbank Interest Rate (TIIE). During the year ended December31, 2014, the Mexican subsidiary repaid 1.1 billion MXN (approximately $80.4 million on the date of repayment) of the outstanding indebtedness using cash on hand. As of December31, 2014, the current margin over TIIE is 1.50%.
Shareholder Loans In connection with the establishment of certain of the Companys joint ventures and related acquisitions of communications sites in Ghana and Uganda, the Companys majority owned subsidiaries entered into shareholder loan agreements, as the borrower, and with wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company and of the Companys joint venture partners, as lenders. The portions of the loans made by the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation and the portions of the loans made by each of the Companys joint venture partners wholly owned subsidiary are reported as outstanding debt of the Company. Outstanding amounts under each of the Companys shareholder loans consist of the following as of December31, (in thousands): 2014 2013 ContractualInterest Rate MaturityDate 2014 Ghana Loan(1)(2) 68,651  21.87 % December31,2019 Uganda Loan(3)(4) 69,004 66,926 5.842 % June 29, 2019 Ghana Loan(2)  158,327 N/A N/A (1) Denominated in GHS.

12.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Below are the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
F-43 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The fair value of the Companys financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured on a recurring basis at fair value is as follows (in thousands): December31, 2014 Fair Value Measurements Using Assets/Liabilities at Fair Value Level1 Level2 Level3 Assets: Short-term investments(1) $ 6,302 $ 6,302 Interest rate swap agreements $ 88 $ 88 Liabilities: Acquisition-related contingent consideration $ 28,524 $ 28,524 Interest rate swap agreements $ 647 $ 647 December31, 2013 FairValueMeasurementsUsing Assets/Liabilities at Fair Value Level1 Level2 Level3 Assets: Short-term investments(1) $ 18,612 $ 18,612 Interest rate swap agreements $ 90 $ 90 Liabilities: Acquisition-related contingent consideration $ 31,890 $ 31,890 Interest rate swap agreements $ 2,185 $ 2,185 (1) Consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities in excess of three months.
Interest Rate Swap Agreements The fair value of the Companys interest rate swap agreements is determined using pricing models with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Fair valuations of the interest rate swap agreements reflect the value of the instrument including the values associated with counterparty risk, the Companys own credit standing and the value of the net credit differential between the counterparties to the derivative contract.
Acquisition-Related Contingent Consideration The Company may be required to pay additional consideration under certain agreements for the acquisition of communications sites if specific conditions are met or events occur. In Colombia and Ghana, the Company may be required to pay additional consideration upon theconversion of certain barter agreements with other wireless carriers to cash-paying lease agreements. In addition, in Costa Rica and the United States, the Company may be required to pay additional consideration if certain pre-designated tenant leases commence during a specified period of time.
Acquisition-related contingent consideration is initially measured and recorded at fair value as an element of consideration in connection with an acquisition with subsequent adjustments recognized in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, and any subsequent changes in fair value, using a discounted probability-weighted approach. This approach takes into consideration Level 3 unobservable inputs including probability F-44 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS assessments of expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled and applies a discount factor that captures the uncertainties associated with the obligation. Changes in these unobservable inputs could significantly impact the fair value of the liabilities recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and adjustments recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
As of December31, 2014, the Company estimates that the value of all potential acquisition-related contingent consideration required payments to be between zero and $40.4 million. During the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, the fair value of the contingent consideration changed as follows (in thousands): 2014 2013 Balance as of January1 $ 31,890 $ 23,711 Additions 6,412 13,474 Settlements (3,889 ) (8,789 ) Change in fair value (225 ) 5,743 Foreign currency translation adjustment (4,934 ) (2,249 ) Other (1) (730 )  Balance as of December31 $ 28,524 $ 31,890 (1) In connection with the sale of operations in Panama, the buyer assumed the Companys potential obligations related to additional purchase price consideration.
Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets Held and Used The Companys long-lived assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs. During the year ended December31, 2014, certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $8,900.0 million were written down to their net realizable value of $8,888.8 million as a result of an asset impairment charge of $11.2 million. During the year ended December31, 2013, certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $8,554.5 million were written down to their net realizable value of $8,538.6 million, as a result of an asset impairment charge of $15.9 million. The asset impairment charges are recorded in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. These adjustments were determined by comparing the estimated proceeds from the sale of assets or the estimated fair value utilizing projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the long-lived assets to the assets carrying value.
During the year ended December31, 2014, NII, a U.S. corporation, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries. NII is the ultimate parent company of certain operating subsidiaries in Brazil, Chile and Mexico that collectively represent approximately 6% of the Companys consolidated revenues for the year ended December31, 2014. None of these subsidiaries were included in NIIs Chapter 11 filing.The Companys assessment of the impact of the proceedings did not identify any indicators of impairment as of December31, 2014.
Sale of Assets During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its operations in Panama and its third-party structural analysis business for an aggregate sale price of $17.9 million, plus a working capital adjustment. At the time of sale, the carrying amount of these assets primarily included $8.1 million of property and equipment, $7.8 million of intangible assets and $3.6 million of goodwill. The Company recorded a net charge of $2.2 million in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
There were no other items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December31, 2014.
F-45 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments for which the carrying value reasonably approximates fair value at December31, 2014 and 2013 include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The Companys estimates of fair value of its long-term obligations, including the current portion, are based primarily upon reported market values. For long-term debt not actively traded, fair value is estimated using either indicative price quotes or a discounted cash flow analysis using rates for debt with similar terms and maturities. As of December31, 2014, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, are $14.6 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively, of which $9.7 billion is measured using Level 1 inputs and $5.3 billion is measured using Level 2 inputs. As of December31, 2013, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $14.5 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively, of which $8.6 billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $6.1 billion was measured using Level 2 inputs.

The remaining loss on cash flow hedges was reclassified into interest expense and the associated tax effect of $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is included in Income tax provision.
F-46 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14.INCOME TAXES The Company has filed, for prior taxable years through its taxable year ended December31, 2011, consolidated U.S. federal tax returns, which included all of its then wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. For its taxable year commencing January1, 2012, the Company filed, and intends to continue to file, as a REIT, and its domestic TRSs filed, and intend to continue to file, as C corporations. The Company also files tax returns in various states and countries. The Companys state tax returns reflect different combinations of the Companys subsidiaries and are dependent on the connection each subsidiary has with a particular state. The following information pertains to the Companys income taxes on a consolidated basis.
The income tax provision from continuing operations is comprised of the following for the years ended December31, (in thousands): 2014 2013 2012 Current: Federal $ (2,390 ) $ (30,322 ) $ (18,170 ) State (797 ) (13,731 ) (6,321 ) Foreign (57,934 ) (44,973 ) (53,513 ) Deferred: Federal (4,180 ) (16,318 ) (13,094 ) State (973 ) (5,139 ) (666 ) Foreign 3,769 50,942 (15,540 ) Income tax provision $ (62,505 ) $ (59,541 ) $ (107,304 ) The income tax provision for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 include an expense of approximately $2.6 million and $21.5 million, respectively, resulting from the restructuring of certain of the Companys domestic TRSs.
The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes and income on equity method investments are as follows for the years ended December31, (in thousands): 2014 2013 2012 United States $ 857,457 $ 766,772 $ 787,960 Foreign 8,247 (225,023 ) (86,666 ) Total $ 865,704 $ 541,749 $ 701,294 Reconciliation between the U.S. statutory rate and the effective rate from continuing operations is as follows for the years ended December31: 2014 2013 2012 Statutory tax rate 35 % 35 % 35 % Tax adjustment related to REIT (1) (35 ) (35 ) (35 ) State taxes, net of federal benefit 1 3 1 Foreign taxes 2 (5 ) 4 Foreign withholding taxes 3 6 4 Domestic TRS restructuring  4  Change in valuation allowance   8 Other 1 3 (2 ) Effective tax rate 7 % 11 % 15 % (1) Includes 24%, 28% and 18% from dividend paid deductions in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
F-47 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The components of the net deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance are as follows as of December31, (in thousands): 2014 2013 (1) Current assets: Allowances, accruals and other items not currently deductible $ 20,525 $ 28,077 Current deferred liabilities (2,799 ) (4,547 ) Subtotal 17,726 23,530 Valuation allowance (3,094 ) (3,638 ) Net current deferred tax assets $ 14,632 $ 19,892 Non-current items: Assets: Net operating loss carryforwards 242,701 197,335 Accrued asset retirement obligations 103,975 88,884 Stock-based compensation 693 4,331 Unearned revenue 18,947 46,788 Unrealized loss on foreign currency 15,952 68,951 Items not currently deductible and other 22,142 23,908 Liabilities: Depreciation and amortization (132,254 ) (82,068 ) Deferred rent (18,355 ) (17,814 ) Other (1,805 ) (5,302 ) Subtotal 251,996 325,013 Valuation allowance (138,147 ) (132,368 ) Net non-current deferred tax assets $ 113,849 $ 192,645 (1) December31, 2013 balances have been revised to reflect purchase accounting measurement period adjustments.
The Companys deferred tax assets as of December31, 2014 in the table above do not include $0.5 million of excess tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options that are a component of NOLs as these benefits can only be recognized when the related tax deduction reduces income taxes payable.
At December31, 2014 and 2013, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of approximately $141.2 million and $136.0 million, respectively, which primarily relates to foreign items. During 2014, the Company increased amounts recorded as valuation allowances due to the uncertainty as to the timing of, and the Companys ability to recover, net deferred tax assets in certain foreign operations in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as the Companys projections for growth.
The recoverability of the Companys net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on its current operations. Accordingly, the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on its current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that the net deferred tax asset will be realized.
The Company considers the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future F-48 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS domestic cash needs. The Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $391.0 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the United States. Should the Company decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, it may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period it determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the United States.
At December31, 2014, the Company had net federal, state and foreign operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, which includes losses of approximately $0.3 billion related to employee stock options. If not utilized, the Companys net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows (in thousands): Years ended December31, Federal State Foreign 2015 to 2019 $  $ 82,656 $ 11,896 2020 to 2024  290,466 163,078 2025 to 2029 510,016 444,038  2030 to 2034 429,759 217,367  Indefinite carryforward   648,731 Total $ 939,775 $ 1,034,527 $ 823,705 Of the above $939.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards, $647.3 million is restricted to offset taxable income of the subsidiaries of the Company.
In addition, the Company has Mexican tax credits of $2.1 million, which if not utilized will expire in 2017.
As of December31, 2014 and 2013, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, is $31.9 million and $31.1 million, respectively. The Company expects the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. The impact of the amount of such changes to previously recorded uncertain tax positions could range from zero to $18.2 million. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows for the years ended December31, (in thousands): 2014 2013 2012 Balance at January1 $ 32,545 $ 34,337 $ 38,886 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 4,187 1,427 1,037 Additions for tax positions of prior years 3,780   Reductions for tax positions of prior years  (320 ) (221 ) Foreign currency (3,216 ) (1,681 ) (439 ) Reduction as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations and effective settlements (1) (5,349 ) (1,218 ) (4,926 ) Balance at December31 $ 31,947 $ 32,545 $ 34,337 (1) Includes $2.1 million of effective settlements for the year ended December31, 2012.
During the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, which resulted in a decrease of $5.3 million, $1.2 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in the liability for uncertain tax benefits, all of which reduced the income tax provision.
F-49 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company recorded penalties and tax-related interest expense (benefit) to the tax provision of ($3.4 million), $3.4 million and ($2.9 million) for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December31, 2014 and 2013, the total unrecognized tax benefits included in the consolidated balance sheets were $31.9 million and $32.5 million, respectively. As of December31, 2014 and 2013, the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included the consolidated balance sheets were $24.9 million and $30.9 million, respectively.
The Company has filed for prior taxable years, and for its taxable year ended December31, 2014 will file, numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns, including U.S. federal and state tax returns and foreign tax returns. The Company is subject to examination in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years. As a result of the Companys ability to carryforward federal, state and foreign NOLs, the applicable tax years generally remain open to examination several years after the applicable loss carryforwards have been used or expired. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December31, 2014.
In September 2013, the Internal Revenue Service released final Tangible Property Regulations (the Final Regulations). The Final Regulations provide guidance on applying Section263(a) of the Code to amounts paid to acquire, produce or improve tangible property, as well as rules for materials and supplies (Code Section162). These regulations contain certain changes from the temporary and proposed tangible property regulations that were issued on December27, 2011. The Final Regulations are generally effective for taxable years beginning on or after January1, 2014. In addition, taxpayers were permitted to early adopt the Final Regulations for taxable years beginning on or after January1, 2012. The Final Regulations did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial condition.
15.STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $80.2 million, $68.1 million and $52.0 million for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December31, 2013 included $1.1 million, related to the modification of the vesting and exercise terms for certain employees equity awards. The Company did not modify the vesting or exercise terms of equity awards during the years ended December31, 2014 and 2012. The Company capitalized $1.6 million of stock-based compensation expense as property and equipment during each of the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013.
Summary of Stock-Based Compensation Plans The Company maintains equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of stock-based awards to its directors, officers and employees. The 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan) provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, as well as restricted stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. Exercise prices in the case of non-qualified and incentive stock options are not less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Equity awards typically vest ratably over various periods, generally four years, and stock options generally expire ten years from the date of grant. As of December31, 2014, the Company has the ability to grant stock-based awards with respect to an aggregate of 14.3million shares of common stock under the 2007 Plan.
The Companys Compensation Committee adopted a death, disability and retirement benefits program in connection with equity awards granted on or after January1, 2013 that provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employees death or permanent disability, or upon an employees qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, F-50 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for grants made on or after January1, 2013, the Company recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation over the shorter of (i)the four-year vesting period or (ii)the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such retirement benefits, which may occur upon grant. Due to the accelerated recognition of stock-based compensation expense related to awards granted to retirement eligible employees, the Company recognized an incremental $14.8 million and $7.8 million of stock-based compensation expense during the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Stock Options The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the table below. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield approximating the estimated life in effect at the accounting measurement date. The expected life of option grants (estimated period of time outstanding) is estimated using the vesting term and historical exercise behavior of the Companys employees. The expected volatility of the underlying stock price is based on historical volatility for a period equal to the expected life of the stock options. The expected annual dividend yield is the Companys best estimate of expected future dividend yield.
Key assumptions used to apply this pricing model are as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Range of risk-free interest rate 1.46%-1.74% 0.75%-1.42% 0.62%-1.03% Weighted average risk-free interest rate 1.64% 0.91% 0.92% Expected life of option grants 4.5 years 4.4 years 4.4 years Range of expected volatility of the underlying stock price 21.94%-23.35% 24.43%-36.09% 36.53%-37.86% Weighted average expected volatility of underlying stock price 23.08% 33.37% 37.84% Expected annual dividend yield 1.50% 1.50% 1.50% The weighted average grant date fair value per share during the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $14.86, $19.05 and $17.46, respectively. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $58.0 million, $42.1 million and $59.5 million, respectively. As of December31, 2014, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options is approximately $32.1 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years. The amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was approximately $56.6 million during the year ended December31, 2014.

As of December31, 2014, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock units granted under the 2007 Plan is $76.3 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) for alleligible employees. Under the ESPP, shares of the Companys common stock may be purchased on the last day of each bi-annual offering period at a 15% discount of the lower of the closing market value on thefirst or last day of such offering period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period and may not purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock in a calendar year (based on market values at the beginning of each offering period). The offering periods run from June1 through November30 and from December1 through May31 of each year. During the 2014, 2013 and 2012 offering periods employee contributions were accumulated to purchase an estimated 81,000, 78,000 and 88,000 shares, respectively, at weighted average prices per share of $70.48, $64.74 and $51.59, respectively. During each six month offering period, employees accumulate payroll deductions to purchase the Companys common stock. The fair value of the ESPP share purchase option is estimated on the offering period commencement date using a Black-Scholes pricing model with the expense recognized over the expected life, which is the F-52 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS six-month offering period. The weighted average fair value per share of ESPP share purchase options during the year ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $14.83, $13.42 and $13.64, respectively. At December31, 2014, 3.4million shares remain reserved for future issuance under the plan.
Key assumptions used to apply the Black-Scholes pricing model for shares purchased through the ESPP for the years ended December31, are as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Range of risk-free interest rate 0.06%0.11% 0.07%0.13% 0.05%0.12% Weighted average risk-free interest rate 0.09% 0.10% 0.08% Expected life of shares 6 months 6 months 6 months Range of expected volatility of underlying stock price over the option period 11.29%16.59% 12.21%13.57% 33.16%33.86% Weighted average expected volatility of underlying stock price 14.14% 12.88% 33.54% Expected annual dividend yield 1.50% 1.50% 1.50% 16.EQUITY Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock Offering On May12, 2014, the Company completed a registered public offering of 6,000,000 shares of its 5.25% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share (the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock).The net proceeds of the offering were $582.9 million after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. The Company used the net proceeds from this offering to fund acquisitions, including the acquisition from Richland, initially funded by indebtedness incurred under the 2013 Credit Facility.
Unless converted earlier, each share of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert on May15, 2017, into between 0.9174 and 1.1468 shares of common stock, depending on the applicable market value of the common stock and subject to anti-dilution adjustments. Subject to certain restrictions, at any time prior to May15, 2017, holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may elect to convert all or a portion of their shares into common stock at the minimum conversion rate then in effect.
Dividends on shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by the Companys Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof) at an annual rate of 5.25% on the liquidation preference of $100.00 per share, on February15,May15,August15 and November15 of each year, commencing on August15, 2014 to, and including, May15, 2017. The Company may pay dividends in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock. The terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock provide that, unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock for all prior dividend periods, no dividends may be declared or paid on common stock.
Stock Repurchase Program In March 2011, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to purchase up to $1.5 billion of common stock (2011 Buyback). In September 2013, the Company temporarily suspended repurchases in connection with its acquisition of MIPT.
Under the 2011 Buyback, the Company is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors.

The Company continues to manage the pacing of the remaining $1.1 billion under the 2011 Buyback in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors, including its financial policies. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases of its common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under its credit facilities. Purchases under the 2011 Buyback are subject to the Company having available cash to fund repurchases.
Sales of Equity Securities The Company receives proceeds from sales of its equity securities pursuant to its ESPP and upon exercise of stock options granted under its equity incentive plans. For the year ended December31, 2014, the Company received an aggregate of $62.3 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and from its ESPP.

These charges are primarily related to assets included in the Companys domestic rental and management segment and are included in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Included in these amounts are impairment charges of approximately $15.3 million, $15.9 million and $21.5 million for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, to write down certain assets to net realizable value after an indicator of impairment was identified. Included in amounts recorded for the year ended December31, 2012, was an impairment charge of approximately $10.8 million resulting from the impairment of one of the Companys outdoor DAS networks upon the termination of a tenant lease.
Also included in these amounts are net losses associated with the sale or disposal of certain non-core towers, other assets and other miscellaneous items of $13.2 million, $16.6 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

F-55 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 19.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
TriStar Litigation The Company was involved in several lawsuits against TriStar Investors LLP and its affiliates (TriStar) in various states regarding single tower sites where TriStar had taken land interests under the Companys owned or managed sites and the Company believes TriStar induced the landowner to breach obligations to the Company.In addition, on February16, 2012, TriStar brought a federal action against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the District Court), in which TriStar principally alleged that the Company made misrepresentations to landowners when competing with TriStar for land under the Companys owned or managed sites.On January22, 2013, the Company filed an amended answer and counterclaim against TriStar and certain of its employees, denying Tristars claims and asserting that TriStar engaged in a pattern of unlawful activity, including: (i)entering into agreements not to compete for land under certain towers; and (ii)making widespread misrepresentations to landowners regarding both TriStar and the Company.Pursuant to a Settlement Agreement dated July9, 2014, all pending state and federal actions between the Company and TriStar were dismissed with prejudice and without payment of damages.
Lease Obligations The Company leases certain land, office and tower space under operating leases that expire over various terms. Many of the leases contain renewal options with specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal option. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to CPI or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the leases.
Future minimum rental payments under non-cancellable operating leases include payments for certain renewal periods at the Companys option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that the Company will renew the leases. Such payments at December31, 2014 are as follows (in thousands): Year Ending December31, 2015 $ 574,438 2016 553,864 2017 538,405 2018 519,034 2019 502,847 Thereafter 4,214,600 Total $ 6,903,188 Aggregate rent expense (including the effect of straight-line rent expense) under operating leases for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 approximated $655.0 million, $495.2 million and $419.0 million, respectively.

Future minimum rental receipts expected from tenants under non-cancellable operating lease agreements in effect at December31, 2014 are as follows (in thousands): Year Ending December31, 2015 $ 3,438,474 2016 3,358,098 2017 3,304,255 2018 3,168,551 2019 2,916,750 Thereafter 10,495,554 Total $ 26,681,682 AT&T Transaction The Company has an agreement with SBC Communications Inc., a predecessor entity to AT&T Inc. (AT&T), that currently provides for the lease or sublease of approximately 2,400 towers from AT&T with the lease commencing between December 2000 and August 2004. Substantially all of the towers are part of the Securitization. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 27 years, assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the sites subject to the applicable lease or sublease upon its expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2013 to 2032, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to that tower. The purchase price for each site is a fixed amount stated in the sublease for that site plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related tower by AT&T. During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company purchased 27 of the subleased towers upon expiration of the applicable agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $8.8 million. The aggregate purchase option price for the remaining towers leased and subleased is approximately $644.9 million, and will accrete at a rate of 10%per annum through the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site. As of December31, 2014, the Company has purchased an aggregate of 31 of the subleased towers upon expiration of the applicable agreement. For all such sites purchased by the Company prior to June30, 2020, AT&T will continue to lease the reserved space at the then-current monthly fee which shall escalate in accordance with the standard master lease F-57 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS agreement for the remainder of AT&Ts tenancy. Thereafter, AT&T shall have the right to renew such lease for up to four successive five-year terms. For all such sites purchased by the Company subsequent to June30, 2020, AT&T has the right to continue to lease the reserved space for successive one-year terms at a rent equal to the lesser of the agreed upon market rate and the then current monthly fee, which is subject to an annual increase based on changes in the CPI.
ALLTEL Transaction In December 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with ALLTEL, a predecessor entity to Verizon Wireless to acquire towers through a 15-year sublease agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, with Verizon Wireless, the Company acquired rights to approximately 1,800 towers in tranches between April 2001 and March 2002. The Company has the option to purchase each tower at the expiration of the applicable sublease, which will occur in tranches between April 2016 and March 2017 based on the original closing date for such tranche of towers. The purchase price per tower as of the original closing date was $27,500 and will accrete at a rate of 3%per annum through the expiration of the applicable sublease. The aggregate purchase option price for the subleased towers is approximately $73.2 million as of December31, 2014. At Verizon Wirelesss option, at the expiration of the sublease, the purchase price would be payable in cash or with 769 shares of the Companys common stock per tower, which would be valued at approximately $134.7 million in the aggregate based on the closing price at December31, 2014.
Guaranties and Indemnifications The Company enters into agreements from time to time in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which it agrees to guarantee or indemnify third parties for certain claims. The Company has also entered into purchase and sale agreements relating to the sale or acquisition of assets containing customary indemnification provisions. The Companys indemnification obligations under these agreements generally are limited solely to damages resulting from breaches of representations and warranties or covenants under the applicable agreements, but do not guaranty future performance. In addition, payments under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to whatever defenses the Company may have and are governed by dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular agreement. Further, the Companys obligations under these agreements may be limited in duration and/or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for payments made by the Company. The Company has not historically made any material payments under these agreements and, as of December31, 2014, is not aware of any agreements that could result in a material payment.
Other Contingencies The Company is subject to income tax and other taxes in the geographic areas where it operates, and periodically receives notifications of audits, assessments or other actions by taxing authorities.The Company evaluates the circumstances of each notification based on the information available, and records a liability for any potential outcome that is probable or more likely than not unfavorable, if the liability is also reasonably estimable. On January21, 2014, the Company received an income tax assessment in the amount of 22.6 billion INR (approximately $369.0 million on the date of assessment), asserting tax liabilities arising out of a transfer pricing review of transactions by Essar Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (ETIPL), and more specifically involving the issuance of share capital and the determination by the tax authority that an income tax obligation arose as a result of such issuance. The assessment was made with respect to transactions that took place in the tax year commencing in 2008, prior to the Companys acquisition of ETIPL. Under the Companys definitive acquisition agreement of ETIPL, the seller is obligated to indemnify and defend the Company with respect to any tax-related liability that may arise from activities prior to March31, 2010. The Company believes that there is no basis upon which the tax assessment can be enforced under existing tax law and accordingly has not recorded an obligation in the consolidated financial statements. The assessment is being challenged with the appellate authorities.

The Companys primary business is leasing space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data and data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. This business is referred to as the Companys rental and management operations and is comprised of domestic and international segments, which as of December 31, 2014, consist of the following:  Domestic: rental and management operations in the United States; and  International: rental and management operations in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Ghana, India, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and Uganda. In November 2014, the Company signed an agreement to acquire communications sites in Nigeria.
The Company has applied the aggregation criteria to operations within the international rental and management operating segments on a basis consistent with managements review of information and performance evaluation.
The Companys network development services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support its site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The network development services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from the rental and management operating segments and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies.
The accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based F-59 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS compensation expense and corporate expenses. For reporting purposes, the international rental and management segment gross margin and segment operating profit also include Interest income, TV Azteca, net. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest, Income (loss) on equity method investments, and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Companys operating segments. All intercompany transactions are eliminated to reconcile segment results and assets to the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets.
Summarized financial information concerning the Companys reportable segments for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 is shown in the following tables. The Other column (i)represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as business development operations, stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense; Other operating expenses; Interest income; Interest expense; Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; and Other income (expense), and (ii)reconciles segment operating profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes and income on equity method investments, as the amounts are not utilized in assessing each segments performance.
