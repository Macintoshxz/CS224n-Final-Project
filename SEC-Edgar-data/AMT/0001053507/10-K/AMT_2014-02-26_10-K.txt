iii Table of Contents PART I ITEM1.BUSINESS Overview We are a leading independent owner, operator and developer of wireless and broadcast communications real estate. Our primary business is leasing antenna space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data and data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our rental and management operations, which accounted for approximately 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December31, 2013. Through our network development services, we offer tower-related services domestically, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Since January1, 2012, we have been organized and have qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.
Our communications real estate portfolio of 67,418 communications sites, as of December31, 2013, includes wireless and broadcast communications towers and distributed antenna system (DAS) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, including, as of December31, 2013, 27,739 towers domestically and 39,330 towers internationally. Our portfolio also includes 349 DAS networks. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements and hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators.
American Tower Corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of American Radio Systems Corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a free-standing public company in 1998. Since inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. In October 2013, we significantly expanded our portfolio through our acquisition of MIP Tower Holdings LLC (MIPT), a private REIT and parent company to Global Tower Partners (GTP), an owner and operator of approximately 5,370 communications sites, through its various operating subsidiaries, in the UnitedStates, Costa Rica and Panama. GTP also manages rooftops and holds property interests that it leases to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We believe the acquisition provides us with key strategic and financial advantages, due to the high quality of the assets, which are in locations complementary to our portfolio. For more information on our acquisition of MIPT, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. Our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. We conduct our international operations through our subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures. Our international operations consist of our operations in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Ghana, India, Mexico, Panama, Peru, South Africa and Uganda.
Our continuing operations are reported in three segments: domestic rental and management, international rental and management and network development services. For more information about our business segments, as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate, see Item7 of this Annual Report under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
We hold and operate certain of our assets through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs). The non-REIT qualified businesses that we hold through TRSs include most of our network development services segment. In addition, we have included most of our international operations and managed networks business within our TRSs.
1 Table of Contents We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries or other disregarded entities (QRSs), and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our TRSs to other subsidiaries, including QRSs. We changed the previous TRS election for certain of our Mexican subsidiaries to be treated as QRSs as of March1, 2013. In addition, we restructured certain of our domestic TRSs to be treated as QRSs as of January1, 2014.
Products and Services Rental and Management Operations Our rental and management operations accounted for approximately 98%, 97% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our tenants lease space on our communications site real estate, where they install and maintain their individual communications network equipment. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. The annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, tower location, amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower, ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity. Our tenant leases are typically non-cancellable and have annual rent escalations. Our primary costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed, with annual cost escalations), property taxes and repairs and maintenance. Our rental and management operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:  Consistent demand for our sites.
As a result of wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base, including the assets acquired as part of our acquisition of MIPT, which are predominately located in key markets and have minimal overlap with our preexisting sites, positions us well to benefit from the increasing demand of global wireless services. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue. Our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.
Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations.
In general, a tenant lease has an initial non-cancellable five to ten year term with multiple five-year renewal terms, and lease payments that typically increase based on a fixed escalation (approximately 3.0%-3.5%per year in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and tenant leases in place as of December31, 2013, we had approximately $23 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, absent the impact of straight-line lease accounting.
High lease renewal rates.
Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect the quality of their network. Churn has been approximately 1%-2% of total rental and management revenue per year. We define churn as revenue lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease, and in limited circumstances, such as a tenant bankruptcy, reductions in lease rates on existing leases. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our revenue lost on this basis by our comparable year ago period rental and management segment revenue.
High operating margins.
Incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively minimal. Therefore, as tenants are added, the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to operating profit. In addition, in many of our international markets certain expenses, such as ground rent or fuel costs, are passed through to our tenants.
Low maintenance capital expenditures.
On average, we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites.
2 Table of Contents Our domestic rental and management segment is comprised of our nationwide network of communications sites that enable us to address the needs of national, regional, local and emerging communications service providers in the United States, as well as customers in a number of other industries. Our domestic rental and management segment also includes property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. Our domestic rental and management segment accounted for approximately 65%, 67% and 72% of our total revenues for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Our international rental and management segment, which is comprised of communications sites in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Ghana, India, Mexico, Panama, Peru, South Africa and Uganda, provides a source of growth and diversification, including exposure to markets in various stages of wireless network development. Our international rental and management segment accounted for approximately 33%, 30% and 26% of our total revenues for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Our rental and management operations include the operation of wireless and broadcast communications towers and managed networks, rooftop management, the leasing of property interests and the provision of backup power through shared generators domestically.
Communications Towers.
Approximately 96%, 96% and 98% of revenue in our rental and management segments was attributable to our communications towers for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
We lease real estate on our communications towers to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services, including personal communications services, cellular voice and data, broadcasting, enhanced specialized mobile radio and fixed microwave.Our top domestic and international tenants by revenue are as follows:  Domestic: AT&T Mobility, Sprint Nextel, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile USA accounted for an aggregate of approximately 83% of domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December31, 2013.
International: Telefnica (in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Mexico, Panama and Peru), MTN Group Limited (in Ghana, South Africa and Uganda), Nextel International (in Brazil, Chile and Mexico), Grupo Iusacell, S.A. de C.V. (in Mexico) and Vodafone (in Germany, Ghana, India and South Africa), accounted for an aggregate of approximately 55% of international rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December31, 2013.
Accordingly, we are subject to certain risks, as set forth in Item1A of this Annual Report under the caption Risk FactorsA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants. In addition, we are subject to risks related to our international operations, as set forth under the caption Risk FactorsOur foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Managed Networks, Property Interests and Shared Generators.
In addition to our communications sites, we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions, provide communications site management services to third parties, manage and/or lease property interests under carrier or other third-party communications sites and provide back-up power sources to tenants at our sites.
Managed Networks.
We own and operate 349 DAS networks primarily in malls and casinos in the United States, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, India and Mexico. We obtain rights from property owners to install and operate in-building DAS networks, and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations. We also offer outdoor DAS networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants, and currently operate such networks in the United States. Typically, we design, build and operate our DAS networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or 3 Table of Contents other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites. We are also currently evaluating other complementary network strategies, such as small cell deployments. In addition, we provide management services to property owners in the United States and certain international markets who own rooftops capable of hosting wireless communications equipment. We obtain rights to manage a rooftop by entering into a contract with a property owner pursuant to which we receive a percentage of occupancy or license fees paid to that property owner by the wireless carriers and other tenants. As the demand for advanced wireless devices in urban markets evolves, we continue to evaluate infrastructure that may support our tenants networks in these areas.
Property Interests.
We own a portfolio of property interests in the United States under carrier or other third-party communications sites, which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements.
Shared Generators.
We contract with certain of our tenants for the right to use shared backup power generators at a number of our sites in the United States.
Network Development Services Through our network development services segment, we offer tower-related services domestically, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. This segment accounted for approximately 2%, 3% and 2% of our total revenues for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Site Acquisition, Zoning and Permitting . We engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects, as well as on behalf of our tenants. We typically work with our tenants engineers to determine the geographic areas where new tower sites will best address the tenants needs and meet their coverage objectives. Once a new site is identified, we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed, and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site.
Structural Analysis.
We offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers. Our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed, which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision. Our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by, among other things, reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness, while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties.
Strategy Operational Strategy Our operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless communications services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets, tablets and other mobile devices, and the corresponding expansion of communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies. To achieve this, our primary focus is to (i)increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio, (ii)invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio, (iii)further improve upon our operational performance and (iv)maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure.
Increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio.
We believe that our highest returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in the United States and in our international markets has 4 Table of Contents resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers. As a result, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located for wireless service providers and have capacity available for additional tenants. In the United States, incremental carrier capital spending is being driven primarily by the build-out of fourth generation (4G)networks, while our international markets are in various stages of network development. As of December31, 2013, we had a global average of approximately 1.9 tenants per tower. We believe that many of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites.
Invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio.
We seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital programs and acquisitions, such as our acquisition of MIPT. We believe we can achieve attractive risk adjusted returns by pursuing such investments. This includes pursuing opportunities to invest in new site construction and acquisitions in our domestic market and in select international markets that we believe have a competitive wireless industry, are attractive from a macroeconomic standpoint and have wireless carriers that are actively deploying wireless networks. In addition, we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases.
Further improve upon our operational performance.
We will continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve our efficiencies and provide superior service to our customers. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis. In addition, our acquisition of MIPT provided us with an opportunity to adopt best practices in an effort to further improve the efficiency of our operational performance.
Maintain a strong balance sheet.
We remain committed to our disciplined financial policies, which are the foundation of our balance sheet management. We believe that these policies result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade ratings. Our acquisition of MIPT resulted in an increase in our total debt and, as a result, we ended 2013 with our net leverage outside of our long-term target range. We remain committed to reducing our net leverage through a combination of debt repayment and our continued growth. We continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position and, as of December31, 2013, had approximately $2.3 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to selectively invest in our portfolio.
Capital Allocation Strategy The objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital. To maintain our REIT status we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt to reduce our net leverage to be within our long-term target range. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy our capital through our annual capital expenditure program, including land purchases and new site construction and acquisitions. In addition, we intend to return our remaining excess capital, if any, to stockholders through our stock repurchase program or by declaring special distributions from time to time. During 2013, we generated $1.6 billion of cash from operating activities, which along with incremental debt, was used to fund nearly $5.2 billion of investments, including $4.5 billion of acquisitions and $724.5 million of 5 Table of Contents capital expenditures. In addition, in 2013, we repurchased $145.0 million, including commissions and fees, of our common stock and paid regular cash distributions in the aggregate of approximately $434.7 million to our stockholders.
Capital expenditure program.
We will continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our annual capital expenditure program. This includes capital expenditures associated with maintenance, increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction, land interest acquisitions and shared generator installations.
Acquisitions.
We will seek to pursue acquisitions of communications sites in our existing or new markets where we can meet our risk adjusted return on investment criteria. Our risk adjusted hurdle rates consider additional risks such as country risk, counter-party risk and product line risk.
Return excess capital to stockholders.
If we have sufficient capital available to (i)satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, (ii)fund our capital expenditures, (iii)repay debt to reduce our net leverage ratio toward our targeted range and (iv)fund anticipated future investments, including acquisition opportunities, we will seek to return any excess capital to stockholders. We typically have utilized a stock repurchase program to facilitate this return.
International Growth Strategy We believe that, in certain international markets, we can create substantial value by either establishing a new, or expanding our existing, independent wireless real estate leasing business. Therefore, we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities, where we believe our risk adjusted return objectives can be achieved. We strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by complementing our presence in emerging markets with operations in more developed and established markets, which enables us to leverage multiple stages of wireless network development throughout our global footprint. Our international growth strategy includes a disciplined, individualized market evaluation, in which we conduct the following analyses:  Country analysis.
Prior to entering a new market, we review the countrys historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals and the general business, political and legal environments, including property rights and regulatory regime.
Wireless industry analysis.
To ensure sufficient demand to support an independent tower company, we analyze the competitiveness of the countrys wireless market and the stage of its wireless network development. Characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include a country that has multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks, as well as deploying incremental spectrum from auctions that have occurred or are anticipated to occur.
Opportunity and counterparty analysis.
Once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with a competitive wireless industry, we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis. This includes evaluating (i)the type of transaction, (ii)its ability to meet our risk adjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved and (iii)how the transaction fits within our long-term strategic objectives, including future potential investment and expansion within the region.
Recent Transactions Acquisitions From January1, 2013 through December31, 2013, we increased our communications site portfolio by approximately 13,070 sites, including approximately 2,370 build-to-suits, and we believe the assets acquired will be accretive to our consolidated operating margins. Acquisitions during the year ended December31, 2013 included:  We acquired approximately 880 communications sites in Mexico from Axtel, S.A.B. de C.V. (January 2013), approximately 1,480 communications sites in Mexico from NII Holdings, Inc. (NII) 6 Table of Contents (November 2013) and approximately 1,940 communications sites in Brazil from NII (December 2013). These acquisitions strengthened our presence in our legacy markets by expanding our site portfolio by nearly 30% in Latin America.
Through our acquisition of approximately 5,370 communications sites from MIPT in October 2013, we expanded our domestic portfolio by over 20%, while also expanding our footprint in Latin America. The acquisition augmented our presence in the top 100 U.S. BTAs where carriers have historically been most active in deploying their networks.
Other acquisitions of an aggregate of approximately 1,030 communications sites in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ghana, Mexico, South Africa and the United States.
We continue to evaluate potential complementary services to supplement our tower site growth and expansion strategy, as well as opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business. For more information about our acquisitions, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Financing Transactions During the year ended December31, 2013, we raised capital, thereby increasing our financial flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Significant financing transactions in 2013 included those set forth below. For more information about our financing transactions, see Item7 of this Annual Report under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Securitization.
In March 2013, we completed a securitization transaction (the Securitization) involving assets related to 5,195 wireless and broadcast communications towers (the Secured Towers) owned by two of our special purpose subsidiaries, through a private offering of $1.8 billion of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013- 2A (collectively, the Securities). We used the net proceeds from the Securitization to refinance the $1.75 billion of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 issued in the securitization transaction completed in May 2007 (the Certificates).
Senior Notes Offerings.
In January 2013, we completed a registered public offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.50% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the 3.50% Notes). In August 2013, we completed a registered public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.40% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the 3.40% Notes) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the 5.00% Notes). We used the net proceeds from each of these notes offerings primarily to repay certain indebtedness under our existing credit facilities.
Credit Facilities.
We increased our borrowing capacity and financial flexibility by entering into a multi-currency $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility in June 2013, which was subsequently increased to $2.0 billion (the 2013 Credit Facility) and a 364-day $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility in September 2013 (the Short-Term Credit Facility). As a result, as of December31, 2013, we had the ability to borrow up to $2.0 billion under our existing credit facilities, net of any outstanding letters of credit. We also entered into a $1.5 billion unsecured term loan in October 2013 (the 2013 Term Loan), and repaid our $750.0million unsecured term loan entered into in June 2012 (the 2012 Term Loan).
Regulatory Matters Towers and Antennas.
Our domestic and international tower business is subject to national, state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration, siting, construction, lighting, marking and maintenance of our towers. In the United States, which accounted for approximately 67% of our total rental and management 7 Table of Contents revenue for the year ended December31, 2013, the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require pre-approval by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields. Towers requiring pre-approval must be registered with the FCC and maintained in accordance with FAA standards. Similar requirements regarding pre-approval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries. Non-compliance with applicable tower-related requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders.
Furthermore, in India, each of our subsidiaries holds an Infrastructure Provider Category-I license (IP-I) issued by the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885. As a condition to the IP-I, the Indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war. In Ghana, our subsidiary holds a Communications Infrastructure License, issued by the National Communications Authority (NCA), which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and DAS networks for communications service providers licensed by the NCA.While we are required to provide tower space on a non-discriminatory basis, we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers. In Chile, our subsidiary is classified as a Telecom Intermediate Service Provider. We have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the Chilean Subsecretaria de Telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in Chile.
Our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions. For example, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has recommended to the Indian Department of Telecommunications changes in annual licensing fees for tower companies based on revenues generated, as well as the potential implementation of certain limitations on foreign ownership. To date, such changes have not been formally adopted. In South Africa, the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, 2003 (the BBBEE Act) has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of South African citizens disadvantaged by Apartheid, and accordingly, the BBBEE Act and related codes measure BBBEE Act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership, management control, employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there. Certain municipalities in Brazil and India have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers. In addition, our foreign operations may be affected if a countrys regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers.
In all countries where we operate, we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations. While these regulations vary, they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities, which can delay or prevent new tower construction, new antenna installation or site upgrade projects, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand. In addition, zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction, tower modifications, and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades. For instance, in June 2012, the Chilean government passed legislation retroactively imposing certain zoning restrictions on telecommunications towers, in response to which we developed a remediation plan. Existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us. These factors could materially and adversely affect our construction activities and operations. In the UnitedStates, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of communications sites. It also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations. Further, in February 2012, the United States government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or collocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations.
8 Table of Contents Portions of our business are subject to additional regulations, for example, in a number of states throughout the United States, certain of our subsidiaries hold Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) or other status, in connection with the operation of our outdoor DAS networks business. In addition, we or our domestic and international tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites.
Environmental Matters.
Our domestic and international operations are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes and the siting of our towers. We may be required to obtain permits, pay additional property taxes, comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries, generators and fuel at our sites. Violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions.
Additionally, in the United States and many other international markets where we do business, before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site, we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment. If a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment, FCC or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed.
Health and Safety.
In the United States and in other countries where we operate, we are subject to various national, state and local laws regarding employee health and safety, including protection from radio frequency exposure.
Competition We compete, both for new business and for the acquisition of assets, with other public tower companies, such as Crown Castle International Corp., SBA Communications Corporation and GTL Infrastructure, wireless carrier tower consortiums such as Indus Towers and private tower companies, independent wireless carriers, tower owners, broadcasters and owners of non-communications sites, including rooftops, utility towers, water towers and other alternative structures. We believe that site location and capacity, network density, price, quality and speed of service have been, and will continue to be, significant competitive factors affecting owners, operators and managers of communications sites.
Our network development services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consultants, structural engineering firms, tower owners/managers, telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants personnel. We believe that our tenants base their decisions for network development services on various criteria, including a companys experience, local reputation, price and time for completion of a project.
Customer Demand Our strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage, quality and capacity of their networks in both our domestic and international markets, driving demand for our communications sites.
Domestic wireless network investments.
According to industry data, aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has increased from approximately $26 billion to over $30 billion over the last three years, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. Demand for our domestic communications sites is driven by:  Wireless service provider focus on network quality and resulting investments in the coverage and capacity of their networks; 9 Table of Contents  Subscriber adoption of advanced wireless data applications such as mobile Internet and video, increasingly advanced devices, and the corresponding deployments and densification of advanced networks by wireless service providers to satisfy this incremental demand for high-bandwidth wireless data;  Increasing wireless data usage continues to incentivize carriers to make incremental investments in their data networks;  Deployment of newly acquired spectrum; and  Deployment of wireless and backhaul networks by new market entrants.
As consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the United States grow, wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment, further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage.
International wireless network investments.
The wireless networks in most of our international markets are typically less advanced than those in our domestic market with respect to the density of voice networks and the current technologies generally deployed for wireless services. Accordingly, demand for our international communications sites is primarily driven by:  Incumbent wireless service providers investing in existing voice networks to improve or expand their coverage and increase capacity;  In certain of our international markets, increasing subscriber adoption of wireless data applications, such as email, Internet and video; and  Spectrum auctions, which result in new market entrants, as well as initial and incremental data network deployments.
We believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality, coverage area and capacity of their existing networks, while also investing in next generation data networks. To meet these network objectives, we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital, rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities. In addition, because our network development services are complementary to our rental and management business, we believe demand for our network development services will continue, consistent with industry trends.
Our customer demand could be adversely affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies, which could make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks without the need for incremental cell sites. The increased use of spectrally efficient technologies or the availability of significant incremental spectrum in the marketplace could potentially relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity problems, and as a result, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space. Additionally, certain complementary network technologies, such as small cell deployments, could shift a portion of our tenants network investments away from the traditional tower-based networks, which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites.
In addition, any increase in the use of network sharing, roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers could adversely affect customer demand for tower space. These arrangements enable a provider to serve its customers outside the providers license area, to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit non-licensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace. Consolidation among wireless carriers could similarly impact customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap. In addition, wireless carriers sharing their sites or permitting equipment location swapping on their sites with other carriers to a significant degree could reduce demand for our communications sites. Further, our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites.

ITEM1A.
RISK FACTORS Decrease in demand for our communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results, and we cannot control that demand.
Factors affecting the demand for our communications sites and, to a lesser extent, our network development services, could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Those factors include:  increased use of network sharing, roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers;  mergers or consolidations among wireless service providers;  governmental licensing of spectrum or restricting or revoking spectrum licenses;  zoning, environmental, health or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof;  a decrease in consumer demand for wireless services due to general economic conditions or other factors, including inflation;  the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure;  the financial condition of wireless service providers;  delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies; and  technological changes.
Any downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit markets could impact consumer demand for wireless services.If wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use, or fail to 11 Table of Contents widely adopt and use wireless data applications, our wireless service provider tenants could experience a decrease in demand for their services.As a result, our tenants may scale back their capital expenditure plans, which could materially and adversely affect leasing demand for our communications sites and our network development services business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Furthermore, the demand for broadcast space in the United States and Mexico depends on the needs of television and radio broadcasters. Among other things, technological advances, including the development of satellite-delivered radio and video services, may reduce the need for tower-based broadcast transmission. In addition, any significant increase in attrition rate or decrease in overall demand for broadcast space could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
If our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
Extensive sharing of site infrastructure, roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment, or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants networks may become redundant. In addition, significant consolidation among our tenants may materially adversely affect our growth and revenues. For example, in the United States, recently combined companies have either rationalized or announced plans to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks, which may result in the decommissioning of certain equipment on our communications sites. We would expect a similar outcome in certain other countries where we do business if consolidation of certain tenants occurs. In addition, certain combined companies have modernized or are currently modernizing their networks, and these and other tenants could determine not to renew leases with us as a result. Our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed.
Our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do.
Our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively. Zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction in their communities, which can delay, prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction, modifications, additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands and requirements. In addition, in certain foreign jurisdictions, we are required to pay annual license fees, and these fees may be subject to substantial increases by the government. Foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and currently are not required to pay license fees may enact license fees, which may apply retroactively. In certain foreign jurisdictions, there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes. Existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us, or that prevent such projects in certain locations. Furthermore, the tax laws, regulations and interpretations governing REITs may change at any time. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us.
As of December31, 2013, we had approximately $14.5 billion of consolidated debt and the ability to borrow additional amounts of approximately $2.0 billion under our credit facilities, net of any outstanding letters of credit. Our leverage could render us unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, 12 Table of Contents interest on, or other amounts due with respect to, our indebtedness. We are also permitted, subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, to draw down on our credit facilities and obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs.
Our leverage could have significant negative consequences on our business, results of operations or financial condition, including:  impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if an uncured default occurs;  increasing our borrowing costs if our current investment grade debt ratings decline;  placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquiring assets;  limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, thereby increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures or REIT distributions;  requiring us to issue debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete; and  limiting our ability to repurchase our common stock or make distributions to our stockholders.
In addition, to meet the REIT distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable, and the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. This would increase our total leverage.
Increasing competition in the tower industry may materially and adversely affect us.
We may experience increased competition, which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly. Some of our competitors, such as wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers, are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do, while other competitors may have lower return on investment criteria than we do.
Our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space. Competitive pricing for tenants on towers from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates and services income. In addition, we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases, resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate.
The higher prices for assets, combined with the competitive pricing pressure on tenant leases, could make it more difficult to achieve our return on investment criteria. Increasing competition for either tower assets or tenants could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk if we are not able to successfully integrate operations, assets and personnel.
As we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including not meeting our return on investment criteria and 13 Table of Contents financial objectives, increased costs, assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions. Achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficiently integrating operations, communications tower portfolios and personnel. Integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among other things, differing systems and processes, cultural differences, customary business practices and conflicting policies, procedures and operations. In addition, integrating businesses may significantly burden management and internal resources, including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel.
Furthermore, our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as complex laws, regulations and business practices that may require additional resources and personnel, and the other risks described immediately below in Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, our foreign operations and expansion initiatives may not succeed and may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. For the year ended December31, 2013, approximately 33% of our consolidated revenue was generated by our international operations, compared to 30% for the year ended December31, 2012. We anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:  changes to existing or new tax laws, methodologies impacting our international operations, or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications sites or our international acquisitions, which may be applied or enforced retroactively;  laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital;  changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions, including inflation or currency devaluation;  changes to zoning regulations or construction laws, which could retroactively be applied to our existing communications sites;  expropriation or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture;  actions restricting or revoking spectrum licenses or suspending business under prior licenses;  potential failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-bribery laws, or Office of Foreign Assets Control requirements;  material site security issues;  significant license surcharges;  increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise), power and other goods and services required for our operations;  price setting or other similar laws for the sharing of passive infrastructure; and  uncertain rulings or results from legal or judicial systems, including inconsistencies among and within laws, regulations and decrees, and judicial application thereof, which may be enforced retroactively, and delays in the judicial process.
14 Table of Contents We also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international business. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts. Our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies. We have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our non-U.S.Dollar operations, and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the U.S.Dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues, operating profits and income.
In our international operations, many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies. These subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities.
In addition, as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally, our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours, be in positions to take action contrary to our interests, policies or objectives, have competing interests in our, or other, markets that could create conflict of interest issues, withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments, any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs, including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture.
A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants.
A substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants. For the year ended December31, 2013, four tenants accounted for approximately 83% of our domestic rental and management segment revenue; and five tenants accounted for approximately 55% of our international rental and management segment revenue. If any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under our agreements with it, our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In the ordinary course of our business, we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases. We have historically resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships. However, it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants or a material modification of the terms of those leases, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged, which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Additionally, due to the long-term nature of our tenant leases, we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants. Many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage. Sometimes our tenants face financial difficulty or file for bankruptcy. In addition, many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures. Downturns in the economy and disruptions in the financial and credit markets have periodically made it more difficult and more expensive to raise capital. If our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans, they may reduce their spending, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our network development services business. If, as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, one or more of our significant tenants experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy, it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset, tower asset, network location intangible asset or customer-related intangible asset. The loss of significant tenants, or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
We may fail to realize the growth prospects and cost savings anticipated as a result of, and will incur significant transaction and acquisition-related integration costs in connection with, our acquisition of MIPT.
The success of the acquisition of MIPT will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our business with those of MIPT. We may never realize 15 Table of Contents these business opportunities and growth prospects, or we may encounter unanticipated accounting, internal control, regulatory or compliance problems.
In addition, we and MIPT have operated independently. As a result, there may be a disruption of each companys ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with tenants, employees or other third parties or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and could harm our financial performance. We anticipate that we will incur certain non-recurring charges in connection with integrating MIPT, including severance and charges associated with integrating process and systems. We currently cannot identify the timing, nature and amount of all such charges. Further, the significant acquisition-related integration costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Although we believe that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to this integration, will offset incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. We also expect to incur costs to implement such efficiencies. In that regard, because MIPT is a private company, we may be required to improve MIPTs internal controls, procedures and policies to meet standards applicable to public companies, which may be time-consuming and more expensive than anticipated.
New technologies or changes in a tenants business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues.
The development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenants business model could reduce the need for tower-based wireless services, decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates. In addition, tenants may have less of their budgets allocated to lease space on our towers, as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies. Examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies, which could relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity needs and as a result, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space. Additionally, certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants network investments away from the traditional tower-based networks, which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites. Moreover, the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for tower-based broadcast services transmission and reception. For example, the growth in the delivery of wireless communications, radio and video services by direct broadcast satellites could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space. Further, a tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model, which would result in a decrease in our revenue. The development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenants business model could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available.
Effective for the taxable year beginning January1, 2012, we began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply.
Qualification as a REIT requires application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the Code.
If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, and are not entitled to relief under the Code:  we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; 16 Table of Contents  we will be subject to federal and state income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates; and  we will be disqualified from REIT tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified.
Any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment and operations would be reduced.
Furthermore, as a result of our acquisition of MIPT, we own an interest in a subsidiary REIT. The subsidiary REIT is independently subject to, and must comply with, the same REIT requirements that we must satisfy in order to qualify as a REIT, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. If the subsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT, and certain relief provisions do not apply, then (i)the subsidiary REIT would become subject to federal income tax, (ii)the subsidiary REIT will be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which qualification was lost, (iii)our ownership of shares in such subsidiary REIT will cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75% gross income test and (iv)we may fail certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs, in which event we will fail to qualify as a REIT unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions.
We may be limited in our ability to fund required distributions using cash generated through our TRSs.
As a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of the REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs to fund these distributions is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT. In particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from real estate, which principally includes gross income from the leasing of our communications sites and qualified rental-related services. Consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other non-qualifying types of income. Thus, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders.
In addition, the majority of our income and cash flows from our TRSs are generated from our international operations. In many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the United States to help satisfy REIT distribution requirements.
Complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.
Our use of TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities. Under the Code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and other non-qualifying assets. This limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy.
Specifically, this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or network development services segment as currently structured and operated, in other non-REIT qualifying operations or assets, or in international operations conducted through TRSs that we do not elect to bring into the REIT structure. Further, acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be 17 Table of Contents adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain REIT requirements prior to closing.
In addition, to meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt, and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to fund these distributions, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings.
Certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which reduce our cash flows, and may create deferred and contingent tax liabilities.
We are subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including alternative minimum taxes, taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash.
Our TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located.
We may need additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements.
To fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities, sell assets or raise equity. We believe our cash provided by operations for the year ending December31, 2014 will sufficiently fund our cash needs for operations, capital expenditures, required REIT distribution payments and cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations through 2014. However, we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our REIT distribution requirements.Depending on market conditions, we may seek to raise capital through credit facilities or debt or equity offerings.An increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating. A downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund our capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives or satisfy our REIT distribution requirements.
If we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. A loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites, which can affect our rights to access and operate a site. From time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under towers, which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites. Further, for various reasons, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. Approximately 88% of the communications sites in our portfolio as of December31, 2013 are located on land we lease pursuant to operating leases. Approximately 74% of the ground 18 Table of Contents leases for these sites have a final expiration date of 2023 and beyond. Further, for various reasons, title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the United States. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
If we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from such towers will be eliminated.
Our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period, or we may choose, for business or other reasons not to exercise our right to purchase such towers. In the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights, or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers. In the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of the acquisitions of a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition, compliance and integration costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility.
The agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. A failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us. If the borrowers were to default on any of the loans, the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets, in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets.
The agreements for our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants, as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests, and could thus limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders, and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. Additionally, our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. Further, if these limits prevent us from satisfying our REIT distribution requirements, we could fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT. If these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts.
In addition, reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to timely provide the required information, we would be in breach of these covenants. For more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above, please see Item7 of this Annual Report under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesFactors Affecting Sources of Liquidity and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
19 Table of Contents We may incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, which could result in a significant reduction to our earnings.
In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired. These circumstances could include a decline in our actual or expected future cash flows or income, a significant adverse change in the business climate, a decline in market capitalization, or slower growth rates in our industry, among others. If the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made.
It is possible that in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets. These charges could be significant, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated.
Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites. The potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health or environmental effects has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years and numerous health-related lawsuits have been filed against wireless carriers and wireless device manufacturers. If a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers, it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.
We could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws.
Our operations are subject to the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As the owner, lessee or operator of real property and facilities, we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation, removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, and for damages and costs relating to off-site migration of hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. We may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at third-party sites to which we sent waste for disposal, even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time. Many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements. We cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all environmental requirements. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. The requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. In certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
20 Table of Contents Our towers or data centers may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage.
Our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, such as ice and wind storms, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as other unforeseen events. Any damage or destruction to our towers or data centers, or certain unforeseen events, may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants. While we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction for a major future event. Further, we carry business interruption insurance, but our insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenues, including potential revenues from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the event. If we are unable to provide services to our tenants, it could lead to tenant loss, resulting in a corresponding material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

(3) We lease two office spaces that together occupy an aggregate of approximately 9,200 square feet.
21 Table of Contents In addition to the principal offices set forth above, we maintain offices in the geographic areas we serve through which we operate our tower leasing and services businesses, as well as maintain offices to pursue international business development initiatives. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs.
As of December31, 2013, we owned and operated a portfolio of 67,418 communications sites in the UnitedStates, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Ghana, India, Mexico, Panama, Peru, South Africa and Uganda. See the table in Item7 of this Annual Report, under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExecutive Overview for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites. In addition, we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators in the United States, which are included in our domestic rental and management segment.
Domestic Rental and Management Segment . Our interests in our domestic communications sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. Pursuant to the loan agreement for the Securitization, the 5,195 towers in the United States subject to the Securitization transaction as of December31, 2013, are subject to mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan. In addition, 1,470 property interests in the United States are subject to mortgages and deeds of trust to secure three separate classes of Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes (the Unison Notes) assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain legal entities from Unison Holdings LLC and Unison Site ManagementII, L.L.C. (the Unison Acquisition). In connection with our acquisition of MIPT, we assumed approximately $1.49 billion principal amount of existing indebtedness under six series, consisting of eleven separate classes, of Secured Tower Revenue Notes issued by certain subsidiaries of GTP in several securitization transactions (the GTP Notes). The GTP Notes are secured by, among other things, 3,893 towers and 1,717 property interests and other related assets.
A typical domestic tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. The principal types of our domestic towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole.
A guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground. A guyed tower can reach heights of up to 2,000 feet. A guyed tower site for a typical broadcast tower can consist of a tract of land of up to 20 acres.
A self-supporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1,000 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site for a typical wireless communications tower can consist of a tract of land of 10,000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2,500 square feet for a metropolitan site.
A monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can consist of a tract of land of fewer than 2,500 square feet.
International Rental and Management Segment . Our interests in our international communications sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by private or government entities. Our financings in Colombia, Costa Rica and South Africa are secured by an aggregate of 2,148 towers.
A typical international tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure, backup or auxiliary power generators and batteries and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. The four principal types of our international towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice, monopole and rooftop. Guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole structures are similar to those in our domestic segment. Rooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas, where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable. Rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet.
22 Table of Contents Ground Leases.
Of the 67,069 towers in our portfolio as of December31, 2013, approximately 88% were located on land we lease. Domestically, ground leases for land under our towers generally have a term of approximately twenty to twenty-five years, which is comprised of an initial term of approximately five years with three or four automatic five-year renewal periods. Internationally, ground leases, or similar agreements that grant use rights for land underlying our towers, typically also have a term of approximately twenty to twenty-five years, which is comprised of an initial term ranging from five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods. As a result, approximately 74% of the ground agreements for our sites have a final expiration date of 2023 and beyond.
Tenants . Our tenants are primarily wireless service providers, broadcasters and other communications service providers. As of December31, 2013, our four top tenants by total revenue were AT&T Mobility (18%), Sprint Nextel (16%), Verizon Wireless (11%)and T-Mobile USA (11%). In general, our tenant leases have an initial non-cancellable term of five to ten years, with multiple five-year renewal terms. As a result, approximately 71% of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2019 or beyond.
ITEM3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are involved in several lawsuits against TriStar Investors LLP and its affiliates (TriStar) in various states regarding single tower sites where TriStar has taken land interests under our owned or managed sites and we believe TriStar has improperly induced the landowner to breach obligations to us.In addition, on February16, 2012, TriStar brought a federal action against us, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, in which TriStar principally alleges that we made misrepresentations to landowners when competing with TriStar for land under our owned or managed sites.On January22, 2013, we filed an amended answer and counterclaim against TriStar and certain of its employees, denying Tristars claims and asserting that TriStar has engaged in a pattern of unlawful activity, including: (i)entering into agreements not to compete for land under certain towers; and (ii)making widespread misrepresentations to landowners regarding both TriStar and us.TriStar and the Company are each seeking injunctive relief that would prohibit the other party from making certain statements when interacting with landowners, as well as damages.
We periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, other than the legal proceeding discussed above and in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

As of February 14, 2014, we had 395,017,519 outstanding shares of common stock and 176 registered holders.
Dividends As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income so as to not be subject to income tax or excise tax on undistributed REIT taxable income. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, our ability to utilize net operating losses (NOLs) to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
During the year ended December31, 2013, we declared and paid the following regular cash distributions to our stockholders: Declaration Date Payment Date Record Date Distribution per share Aggregate Payment Amount (in millions) March12, 2013 April 25, 2013 April10, 2013 $ 0.26 $ 102.8 May22, 2013 July16, 2013 June17, 2013 $ 0.27 $ 106.7 September 12, 2013 October7, 2013 September23,2013 $ 0.28 $ 110.5 December4, 2013 December31,2013 December16,2013 $ 0.29 $ 114.5 During the year ended December31, 2012, we declared and paid the following regular cash distributions to our stockholders: Declaration Date Payment Date Record Date Distribution per share Aggregate Payment Amount (in millions) March 22, 2012 April 25, 2012 April 11, 2012 $ 0.21 $ 82.9 June 20, 2012 July 18, 2012 July 2, 2012 $ 0.22 $ 86.9 September 19, 2012 October 15, 2012 October 1, 2012 $ 0.23 $ 90.9 December 6, 2012 December31,2012 December17,2012 $ 0.24 $ 94.8 24 Table of Contents Performance Graph This performance graph is furnished and shall not be deemed filed with the SEC or subject to Section18 of the Exchange Act, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements herein and the accompanying notes thereto, and the information set forth under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below.
Our continuing operations are reported in three segments, domestic rental and management, international rental and management and network development services. Among other factors, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit in its assessment of operating performance in each business segment. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the international rental and management segment also include Interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Loss on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest, Income (loss) on equity method investments and Income tax provision (benefit).
Executive Overview Our primary business is leasing antenna space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data and data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our rental and management operations, which accounted for approximately 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December31, 2013 and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment. Through our network development services, we offer tower-related services domestically, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. We began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective January1, 2012.
28 Table of Contents The following table details the number of communications sites we owned or operated as of December31, 2013: Country Numberof Owned Sites Numberof Operated Sites(1) United States 20,795 7,224 International: Brazil 6,609 155 Chile 1,154  Colombia 2,755 706 Costa Rica 456  Germany 2,031  Ghana 1,979  India 11,542  Mexico 8,194 199 Panama 57  Peru 498  South Africa 1,900  Uganda 1,164  (1) All of the communications sites we operate are held pursuant to long-term capital leases, including those subject to purchase options.
The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial non-cancellable term of five to ten years, with multiple five-year renewal terms. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended December31, 2013 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December31, 2013, we expect to generate approximately $23 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, absent the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually based on a fixed escalation (approximately 3.0%-3.5% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets.
The revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi-year contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however in some instances, a lease may be canceled upon the payment of a termination fee.
Revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations. During the year ended December31, 2013, loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 1.5% of our rental and management operations revenues.
Rental and Management Operations Revenue Growth . Our rental and management revenue growth is comprised of (i)growth in organic revenue, which is revenue from sites that existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period (legacy sites) and (ii)growth from sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period (new sites). The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our domestic and international rental and management segments are:  Recurring revenues from tenant leases generated from legacy sites;  Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of cancellations;  New revenue generated from leasing additional space on our legacy sites; and  New revenue generated from new sites.
29 Table of Contents We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for wireless real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites, which increases these sites utilization and profitability. In addition, we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. Our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, consistent with our strategic acquisition of MIPT, we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk adjusted return on investment criteria.
Rental and Management Operations Organic Revenue Growth . Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. The following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth:  Domestic . As a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of bandwidth-intensive wireless data applications and advanced wireless devices, wireless service providers in the United States continue to invest in their wireless networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites. Growth in wireless data demand has driven wireless providers in the United States to deploy increasing levels of annual wireless capital investment and as a result, we have experienced strong demand for our communications sites.
We expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:  The deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect our tenants to continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing networks.
Wireless service providers compete based on the overall capacity and coverage of their existing wireless networks. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage.
Wireless service providers are also investing in reinforcing their networks through incremental backhaul and the utilization of on-site generators, which typically results in additional equipment leased at the tower site, and incremental revenue.
Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional equipment to their network as they seek to optimize their network configuration.
We have entered into holistic master lease agreements with three of our four largest tenants in the United States, which provide for consistent, long-term revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn. Typically, these agreements include built-in annual escalators, fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a pre-determined amount of equipment on certain of our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded. Our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.
30 Table of Contents  International . As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in three distinct stages of network development in order to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as MTN, Telefnica and Vodafone as part of our expansion efforts. We believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.
In emerging markets such as India, Ghana and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas. In more developed urban locations within these markets, early-stage data network deployments are also underway. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate.
In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are focused on third generation (3G)network build outs, with select investments in fourth generation (4G)technology. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly, which mandates that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service.
Finally, in markets with more mature network technology such as Germany and Panama, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage. With a more mature customer base, higher smartphone penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity.
We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 39,400 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable, long-term growth.
Rental and Management Operations New Site Revenue Growth.
The results of operations of MIPT have been included in our consolidated results of operations since October1, 2013, the date of the acquisition. During the period from October1, 2013 to December31, 2013, MIPT generated total revenues of $84.1 million and gross margin of $65.0 million. In addition to the approximately 5,370 sites acquired through the acquisition of MIPT, during the year ended December31, 2013, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 7,700 sites. In a majority of our international markets, the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio.
New Sites (Acquired or Constructed) 2013 2012 2011 Domestic 5,260 960 470 International(1) 7,810 7,850 10,000 (1) The majority of sites acquired or constructed in 2013 were in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Mexico and South Africa; in 2012 were in Brazil, Germany, India and Uganda; and in 2011 were in Brazil, Colombia, Ghana, India, Mexico and South Africa.
31 Table of Contents Network Development Services Segment Revenue Growth . As we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our total revenues. Through our network development services segment, we offer tower-related services, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites, including in connection with provider network upgrades.
Rental and Management Operations Expenses.
Direct operating expenses incurred by our domestic and international rental and management segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance, security and power and fuel costs, some of which may be passed through to our tenants. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our domestic and international rental and management segments selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year.As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio.Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (Adjusted EBITDA), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT FFO), and Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO).
We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) on discontinued operations, net; Income (loss) on equity method investments; Income tax provision (benefit); Other income (expense); Loss on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense.
NAREIT FFO is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges and real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, and including adjustments for (i)unconsolidated affiliates and (ii)noncontrolling interest.
We define AFFO as NAREIT FFO before (i)straight-line revenue and expense; (ii)stock-based compensation expense; (iii)the non-cash portion of our tax provision; (iv)non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v)amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi)other income (expense); (vii)loss on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii)other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix)unconsolidated affiliates and (x)noncontrolling interest, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures.
Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Neither NAREIT FFO nor AFFO represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1)each is a 32 Table of Contents key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments; (2)Adjusted EBITDA is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants; (3)Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4)each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (5)each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies.
Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.

We recorded a loss of $35.3 million due to the repayment of the $1.75 billion outstanding balance of the Certificates and incurred prepayment consideration and recorded the acceleration of deferred financing costs. In addition, we recorded a loss of $3.4 million related to the acceleration of the remaining deferred financing costs associated with our $1.0 billion unsecured credit facility entered into in April 2011 (the 2011 Credit Facility) and the 2012 Term Loan.
Other Expense Year Ended December31, Amount of Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2013 2012 Other expense $ 207,500 $ 38,300 $ 169,200 442 % During the year ended December31, 2013, other expense increased to $207.5 million. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in unrealized foreign currency losses of $177.4 million. During the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded unrealized foreign currency losses of approximately $211.7 million and $34.3 million, respectively, resulting primarily from fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries functional currencies. The increase in unrealized foreign currency losses is primarily due to the negative impact associated with fluctuations in the Ghanaian Cedi and the Brazilian Reais.
Income Tax Provision Year Ended December31, Amount of Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2013 2012 Income tax provision $ 59,541 $ 107,304 $ (47,763 ) (45 )% Effective tax rate 11.0 % 15.3 % 37 Table of Contents The income tax provision for the year ended December31, 2013 decreased 45% to $59.5 million. The effective tax rate (ETR) for the year ended December31, 2013 decreased to 11.0% from 15.3%. The ETR during the year ended December31, 2012 included an increase of 8% due to a valuation allowance recorded on certain previously unreserved deferred tax assets. The ETR during the year ended December31, 2013 included an increase of 4% due to the restructuring of our domestic TRSs.
As a REIT, we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated in our QRSs. In addition, we are able to offset income in both our TRSs and QRSs by utilizing our NOLs, subject to specified limitations.
The ETR on income from continuing operations for the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT effective as of January1, 2012 and adjustments for foreign items.

The increase in our operating profit of $307.2 million, as described above, was partially offset by increases in corporate SG&A, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, interest expense and a loss on retirement of long-term obligations recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, the increase in our operating profit was partially offset by an increase in other expenses, primarily due to unrealized foreign currency losses. Net income was positively impacted by a decrease in our income tax provision.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December31, 2013 increased 15% to $2,176.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin of $355.8 million, and was partially offset by an increase in SG&A of $71.9 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.

International rental and management segment SG&A for the year ended December31, 2012 increased 16% to $95.6 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the launch of operations in our new markets as well as our continued investments in international expansion initiatives in foreign operations, partially offset by the reversal of approximately $3.8 million of bad debt expense in Mexico for amounts previously reserved.
Network development services segment SG&A for the year ended December31, 2012 decreased 14% to $6.7 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reversal of bad debt expense upon the receipt of a customer payment for amounts previously reserved, partially offset by higher personnel related costs.
Other SG&A for the year ended December31, 2012 increased 14% to $139.3 million. The increase was primarily due to a $12.4 million increase in corporate expenses and a $5.1 million increase in SG&A related stock-based compensation expense.

This decrease was primarily attributable to our dividend paid deduction and decreased state taxes during the year ended December31, 2012, partially offset by an increase in foreign taxes and valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. The deferred tax assets arose primarily as a result of purchase accounting and existing NOLs, which were generated partly from interest on intercompany debt.
The ETR on income from continuing operations for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT effective as of January1, 2012 and to adjustments for foreign items.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the year ended December31, 2013, we raised capital, thereby increasing our financial flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Our significant 2013 financing transactions included:  The completion of the Securitization involving assets related to the Secured Towers, which are owned by two of our special purpose subsidiaries, through a private offering of $1.8 billion of the Securities. We used the net proceeds from the Securitization to repay the $1.75 billion of the Certificates.
44 Table of Contents  The completion of a registered public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.40% Notes and $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.00% Notes. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility.
The completion of a registered public offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 3.50% Notes. We used the net proceeds to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the 2011 Credit Facility and a portion of the outstanding indebtedness incurred under our $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in January 2012 (the 2012 Credit Facility).
The refinancing of our credit facilities, including the termination of the 2011 Credit Facility upon entering into the 2013 Credit Facility and the repayment and termination of the 2012 Term Loan upon the entering into the 2013 Term Loan. We also increased our borrowing capacity by entering into the Short-Term Credit Facility.
As of December31, 2013, we had approximately $2.3 billion of total liquidity. In January 2014, we repaid $88.0 million under the 2012 Credit Facility and $710.0 million under the 2013 Credit Facility with proceeds from the issuance of $250 million aggregate principal amount of reopened 3.40% Notes and $500 million aggregate principal amount of reopened 5.00% Notes and cash on hand. As a result, our liquidity increased by $798.0 million in January 2014.
Summary cash flow information for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 is set forth below (in thousands): 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 1,599,047 $ 1,414,391 $ 1,165,942 Investing activities (5,173,337 ) (2,558,385 ) (2,790,812 ) Financing activities 3,525,565 1,170,366 1,086,095 Net effect of changes in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (26,317 ) 12,055 (14,997 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (75,042 ) $ 38,427 $ (553,772 ) We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, communications site construction and managed network installations, and tower and land acquisitions, such as our acquisition of MIPT. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions of our REIT taxable income in order to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code and fund our stock repurchase program. We fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions.
As of December31, 2013, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $14.5 billion. During the year ended December31, 2013, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required REIT distributions. We believe the cash generated by operations during the year ending December31, 2014 will be sufficient to fund our REIT distribution requirements, capital expenditures and our debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2014. If our pending acquisitions, capital expenditures or debt repayments exceed the cash generated by our operations, we believe we have sufficient borrowing capacity under our credit facilities to fund our activities. As of December31, 2013, we had approximately $211.3 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $61.7 million was held by our joint ventures. Historically, it has not been our practice to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes.
45 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December31, 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $1,599.0 million, an increase of $184.7 million as compared to the year ended December31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the operating profit of our rental and management segments as compared to the year ended December31, 2012, partially offset by increases in Other SG&A and cash paid for interest and a decrease in cash provided by working capital. Working capital was positively impacted by the receipt of capital contributions from tenants and partially offset by an increase in prepaid assets.
For the year ended December31, 2012, cash provided by operating activities was $1,414.4 million, an increase of $248.4 million as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the operating profit of our rental and management segments and an increase in cash provided by working capital. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest and income taxes during the year ended December31, 2012.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the year ended December31, 2013, cash used for investing activities was $5,173.3 million, an increase of approximately $2,615.0 million, as compared to the year ended December31, 2012.

We completed the acquisition of MIPT for an estimated purchase price of approximately $4.9 billion, funded by cash payments of $3.3 billion and the assumption of approximately $1.5 billion of existing MIPT debt. In addition, we spent $1.2 billion to acquire approximately 5,330 communications sites in our legacy markets, primarily in Mexico and Brazil.

Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013-2A .On March15, 2013, we completed the Securitization involving assets related to the Secured Towers owned by two of our special purpose subsidiaries, through a private offering of $1.8 billion of the Securities. The net proceeds of the transaction were $1.78 billion. The Securities were issued by American Tower Trust I (the Trust), a trust established by American Tower Depositor Sub, LLC (the Depositor), our indirect wholly owned special purpose subsidiary.The assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan (the Loan) to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (the Borrowers), pursuant to a First Amended and Restated Loan 47 Table of Contents and Security Agreement dated as of March15, 2013 (the Loan Agreement).The Borrowers are special purpose entities formed solely for the purpose of holding the Secured Towers subject to a securitization.
The Securities were issued in two separate series of the same class pursuant to a First Amended and Restated Trust and Servicing Agreement (the Trust Agreement), with terms identical to the Loan.The Series 2013-1A Securities have an expected life of five years with a final repayment date in March 2043 and an interest rate of 1.551%. The Series 2013-2A Securities have an expected life of ten years with a final repayment date in March 2048 and an interest rate of 3.070%. The effective weighted average life and interest rate of the Securities was 8.6years and 2.648%, respectively, as of the date of issuance.
The Borrowers may prepay the Loan in whole or in part at any time, provided it is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration.If the prepayment occurs within twelve months of the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2013-1A Securities or eighteen months of the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2013-2A Securities, no prepayment consideration is due.The entire unpaid principal balance of the component of the Loan related to the Series 2013-1A Securities and the Series 2013-2A Securities will be due in March 2043 and March 2048, respectively.The Loan may be defeased in whole at any time prior to the anticipated repayment date for any component of the Loan then outstanding.
The Loan is secured by (1)mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Secured Towers, (2)a pledge of the Borrowers operating cash flows from the Secured Towers, (3)a security interest in substantially all of the Borrowers personal property and fixtures and (4)the Borrowers rights under the tenant leases and the management agreement entered into in connection with the Securitization. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the Borrowers, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC, whose only material asset is its equity interest in American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, each have guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations.American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC, American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, the Depositor and the Borrowers each were formed as special purpose entities solely for purposes of entering a securitization transaction, and the assets and credit of these entities are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of us or any other person, except as set forth in the Loan Agreement.
The Loan Agreement includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement). The organizational documents of the Borrowers contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that the Borrowers maintain at least two independent directors.The Loan Agreement also contains certain covenants that require the Borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Loan Agreement and other agreements related to the Secured Towers, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the Secured Towers, including the right to conduct site investigations.
A failure to comply with the covenants in the Loan Agreement could prevent the Borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the Secured Towers, and could prevent the Borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of the Secured Towers to us. If the Borrowers were to default on the Loan, the servicer could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the Secured Towers, in which case we could lose the Secured Towers and the revenue associated with those assets.
Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums, and to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Secured Towers. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement, all rental cash receipts received for each month are reserved for the succeeding month and held in an account controlled by the trustee and then 48 Table of Contents released. The $103.2 million held in the reserve accounts as of December31, 2013 was classified as Restricted cash on our accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
GTP Notes . In connection with our acquisition of MIPT, we assumed approximately $1.49 billion principal amount of existing indebtedness under the GTP Notes.

The GTP Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time beginning two years after the date of issuance, provided such payment is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within six months of the anticipated repayment date, with respect to the Series 2010-1 notes, or one year of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the other GTP Notes, no prepayment consideration is due.
As of December31, 2013, the GTP Notes were secured by, among other things, an aggregate of 3,893 sites and 1,717 property interests owned by subsidiaries of the GTP Issuers and other related assets (the GTP Secured Towers).
Amounts due under the GTP Notes will be paid from the cash flows generated by the GTP Secured Towers that secure the applicable series of GTP Notes.These funds in turn will be used to service the payment of interest on the applicable series of GTP Notes and for any other payments required by the indentures governing the GTP Notes (the GTP Indentures).
The GTP Indentures include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for note offerings subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the GTP Issuers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary exceptions for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the GTP Indentures). The GTP Indentures also contain certain covenants that require the GTP Issuers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports, operating budgets and budgets for capital improvements not included in annual financial statements in accordance with GAAP, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the GTP Indentures and other agreements related to the GTP Secured Towers, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the GTP Secured Towers, including the right to conduct site investigations.
49 Table of Contents A failure to comply with the covenants in the GTP Indentures could prevent the GTP Issuers from taking certain actions with respect to the GTP Secured Towers and could prevent the GTP Issuers from distributing excess cash flow to us. In addition, upon occurrence and during an event of default, the trustee may, in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of GTP Notes, declare such series of GTP Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such GTP Notes. Furthermore, if the GTP Issuers were to default on a series of the GTP Notes, the trustee may demand, collect, take possession of, receive, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the GTP Secured Towers securing such series, in which case we could lose the GTP Secured Towers and the revenue associated with those assets.
Under the GTP Indentures, the GTP Issuers are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for amounts received or due from tenants related to future periods, property taxes, insurance, ground rents, certain expenses and debt service. The $26.8 million held in the reserve accounts as of December31, 2013 was classified as Restricted cash on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Costa Rica Loan.
In connection with our acquisition of MIPT, we assumed $32.6 million of secured debt in Costa Rica (the Costa Rica Loan).

2012 Credit Facility .On September26, 2013, we borrowed $963.0 million under the 2012 Credit Facility to partially fund our acquisition of MIPT. On October29, 2013, we repaid $800.0 million with net proceeds from the 2013 Term Loan and cash on hand. On December30, 2013, we repaid an additional $75.0 million. Accordingly, as of December31, 2013, we had $88.0 million outstanding under the 2012 Credit Facility and had approximately $7.5 million of undrawn letters of credit. In January 2014, we repaid all amounts outstanding with proceeds from the offering of reopened 3.40% Notes and reopened 5.00% Notes. We maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under our 2012 Credit Facility in the ordinary course.
The 2012 Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on January31, 2017. The current margin over LIBOR that we incur on borrowings is 1.625%, and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2012 Credit Facility is 0.225%.
On September20, 2013, we entered into an amendment agreement with respect to the 2012 Credit Facility, which (i)amended the definition of Total Debt to be net of unrestricted domestic cash and cash equivalents and (ii)increased the permitted ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined therein) from 6.00 to 1.00 to 6.50 to 1.00 from September30, 2013 to September30, 2014.

2013 Credit Facility.
On June28, 2013, we entered into the 2013 Credit Facility, which initially allowed us to borrow up to $1.5 billion, and includes a $1.0 billion sublimit for multicurrency borrowings, a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit, a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans and an expansion option allowing us to request additional commitments of up to $500.0 million, which we exercised on September20, 2013. As a result, we may borrow up to $2.0 billion under the 2013 Credit Facility.
The 2013 Credit Facility has a term of five years, matures on June28, 2018 and includes two one-year renewal periods at our option. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at final maturity. The 2013 Credit Facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium.
We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or LIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the 2013 Credit Facility. The interest rate ranges between 1.125% to 2.000% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.125% to 1.000% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2013 Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.125% to 0.400%per annum, based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR that we incur on borrowings is 1.250% and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the new credit facility is 0.150%.
The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreement would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds, but would constitute a default, which could result in, 51 Table of Contents among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.
On September20, 2013, we entered into an amendment agreement with respect to the 2013 Credit Facility, which (i)amended the definition of Total Debt to be net of unrestricted domestic cash and cash equivalents, (ii)increased the permitted ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined therein) from 6.00 to 1.00 to 6.50 to 1.00 from September30, 2013 to September30, 2014 and (iii)added an additional expansion feature permitting us to request an additional increase of the commitments under the 2013 Credit Facility from time to time up to an aggregate additional $750.0 million, including in the form of a term loan, from any of the lenders or other eligible lenders that elect to make such increases available, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.

The unutilized portion of the commitments under the Short-Term Credit Facility may be irrevocably reduced or terminated by us in whole or in part without penalty. The Short-Term Credit Facility matures on September19, 2014.
Amounts borrowed under the Short-Term Credit Facility will bear interest, at our option, at a margin above LIBOR or the defined base rate. For LIBOR based borrowings, interest rates will range from 1.125% to 2.000% above LIBOR. For base rate borrowings, interest rates will range from 0.125% to 1.000% above the defined base rate. In each case, the applicable margin is based upon our debt ratings. In addition, the loan agreement provides for a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Short-Term Credit Facility ranging from 0.125% to 0.400%per annum, based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR that we would incur (should we choose LIBOR) on borrowings is 1.250% and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion is 0.150%.
The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply.

Interest on the 3.40% Notes and the 5.00% Notes began to accrue from August19, 2013 and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
We may redeem the 3.50% Notes, the 3.40% Notes or the 5.00% Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such notes, plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date.

The supplemental indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we, and our subsidiaries, may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the supplemental indenture.
Stock Repurchase Program.
In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to $1.5 billion of common stock (the 2011 Buyback).

To facilitate repurchases, we make purchases pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods.
We continue to manage the pacing of the remaining $1.1 billion under the 2011 Buyback in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors, including our financial policies. We expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Purchases under the 2011 Buyback are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases.
Sales of Equity Securities.
We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. For the year ended December31, 2013, we received an aggregate of $45.5 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and from our employee stock purchase plan.
Distributions.
As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income so as to not be subject to income tax or excise tax on undistributed REIT taxable income. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions, however, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
During the year ended December31, 2013, we declared an aggregate of $434.5 million in regular cash distributions to our stockholders, which included our fourth quarter distribution of approximately $114.5 million on December31, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December16, 2013. For more details on the regular cash distributions paid to our stockholders during the year ended December31, 2013, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
54 Table of Contents We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock unit awards granted subsequent to January1, 2012, which are payable upon vesting.As of December31, 2013, we accrued $1.9 million of distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units. During the year ended December31, 2013, we paid $0.2 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units.

(14) Other non-current liabilities exclude $30.5 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $30.9 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
Interest Rate Swap Agreements . We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in Colombia, Costa Rica and South Africa. All of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of $139.3 million, interest rates ranging from 1.62% to 7.83% and expiration dates through November 2020. On February12, 2014, we repaid the Costa Rica Loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap agreements.
Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds . Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2013 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to 56 Table of Contents generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites.
Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities .The loan agreements for the 2012 Credit Facility, the 2013 Credit Facility, the Short-Term Credit Facility and the 2013 Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage, senior secured leverage and interest coverage, as set forth below. As of December31, 2013, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.
Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in the loan agreements) of 6.50 to 1.00 through September30, 2014, and of 6.00 to 1.00 thereafter. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December31, 2013, we could incur approximately $1.2 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $185 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio.
Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Senior Secured Debt (as defined in the loan agreements) to Adjusted EBITDA of 3.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December31, 2013, we could incur approximately $3.4 billion of additional Senior Secured Debt and still remain in compliance with the current ratio (effectively, however, this ratio would be limited to $1.2 billion to remain in compliance with other covenants). In addition, if we maintain our existing Senior Secured Debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $1.1 billion and we would still remain in compliance with the current ratio.
Interest Coverage Ratio: In the event our debt ratings fall below investment grade, we will be required to maintain a ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense (as defined in the loan agreements) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December31, 2013, our interest expense, which was $447 million for that period, could increase by approximately $500 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $1.2 billion and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.
Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but would constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.
Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the Securitization and the GTP Notes . The Loan Agreement related to the Securitization and the GTP Indentures include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and 57 Table of Contents other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers and GTP Issuers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement and GTP Indentures).
Under the terms of the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Loan or the GTP Notes (as applicable), which must be deposited, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the assets securing the Loan or the GTP Notes are released to the Borrowers or the applicable GTP Issuer, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. Since the inception of the Loan in March 2013 through December31, 2013, the Borrowers have distributed excess cash to us of approximately $496.1 million. Since our assumption of the GTP Notes on October1, 2013, through December31, 2013, the GTP Issuers have distributed excess cash to us of approximately $48.8 million.
In order to distribute this excess cash flow to us, the Borrowers and the GTP Issuers must maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio (DSCR), calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the applicable GTP Indenture) to the amount of interest required to be paid over the succeeding twelve months on the principal amount of the Loan or the principal amount of the GTP Notes that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination, plus the amount of the payable trustee and servicing fees. If the DSCR with respect to the Securities or any series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Towers or GTP Partners is equal to or below 1.30x (the Cash Trap DSCR) at the end of any calendar quarter and it continues for two consecutive calendar quarters, or if the DSCR with respect to any series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites is equal to or below the Cash Trap DSCR at the end of any calendar month and it continues for two consecutive calendar months, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required with respect to the particular series of Securities or GTP Notes under the Loan Agreement or GTP Indentures, as applicable, will be deposited into reserve accounts instead of being released to the Borrowers or the GTP Issuers. The funds in the reserve accounts will not be released to the Borrowers, GTP Towers or GTP Partners for distribution to us unless the DSCR with respect to such series of Securities or GTP Notes exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Likewise, the funds in the reserve account will not be released to GTP Cellular Sites for distribution to us unless the DSCR with respect to such series of GTP Notes exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar months.
Additionally, an amortization period, commences as of the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the Securities and the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Towers and GTP Partners, and as of the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites, if the DSCR of such series equals or falls below 1.15x (the Minimum DSCR). The amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the Securities and the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Towers and GTP Partners for which the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Similarly, the amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites, for which the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar months.
If on the anticipated repayment date, the outstanding principal amount with respect to any series of the GTP Notes or the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Securities has not been paid in full, an amortization period will continue until such principal amount of the applicable series of GTP Notes or the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of Securities is repaid in full.
During an amortization period, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to pay principal of the applicable subclass of Securities or series of GTP Notes on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, 58 Table of Contents additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any subclass of the Securities or series of GTP Notes from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the Loan Agreement or Indentures, as applicable.
Consequently, a failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent the Borrowers or GTP Issuers from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, meet REIT distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program. If the Borrowers were to default on the Loan, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the Secured Towers, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers. In addition, upon occurrence and during an event of default, the trustee may, in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of GTP Notes, declare such series of GTP Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such GTP Notes. Furthermore, if the GTP Issuers were to default on a series of the GTP Notes, the trustee may demand, collect, take possession of, receive, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the GTP Secured Towers securing such series, in which case we could lose the GTP Secured Towers and the revenue associated with those assets.
As of December31, 2013, the Borrowers DSCR was 9.34x. Based on the Borrowers net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended December31, 2013 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the Loan, the Borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately $383 million in net cash flow before triggering the Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $390 million in net cash flow before triggering the Minimum DSCR. As of December31, 2013, the DSCR of GTP Towers, GTP Partners and GTP Cellular Sites were 3.53x, 2.84x and 2.48x, respectively. Based on the net cash flow of GTP Towers, GTP Partners and GTP Cellular Sites for the calendar quarter ended December31, 2013 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the applicable series of GTP Notes, GTP Towers, GTP Partners and GTP Cellular Sites could endure a reduction of approximately $29.0 million, $66.8 million and $15.7 million, respectively, in net cash flow before triggering the Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $31.0 million, $73.3 million and $17.7 million, respectively, in net cash flow before triggering the Minimum DSCR.
As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, in order to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program, we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities.If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program.
In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item1A of this Annual Report under the caption Risk Factors, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to impairment of assets, asset retirement 59 Table of Contents obligations, accounting for acquisitions, revenue recognition, rent expense, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December31, 2013. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.
Impairment of AssetsAssets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows under this approach is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. If the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows, measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.
We monitor our customer-related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the customer-related intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of the customer-related intangible asset may not be recoverable, we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset, as compared to the assets carrying value. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.
Impairment of AssetsGoodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments and network development services segment. We utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, managements expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess.
60 Table of Contents During the year ended December31, 2013, no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test. The fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value and passed with a substantial margin; except for one reporting unit, whose fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately $14.3 million. For this reporting unit, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of (i)a 2% reduction in projected revenues, (ii)a 60 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital or (iii)a 20% reduction in terminal sales growth rate, individually, which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusions.
The goodwill recorded in this reporting unit approximated $15.4 million as of December31, 2013, and is the result of recently completed acquisitions. Accordingly, the sensitivity of projections to changes in the various assumptions is due, in part, to the timing of the underlying acquisition, current levels of cash flows and amounts of cash flows generated in excess of the planned amounts. Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the measurement date, the fair value of intangible assets and goodwill used to test for impairment is in line with the fair value used to initially measure the business.
Asset Retirement Obligations: We recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligations estimated settlement date.
We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $10.3 million during the year ended December31, 2013. The change in 2013 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary.
Acquisitions : For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we allocate the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. For those transactions that do not meet the definition of a business combination, we allocate the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets (primarily acquired customer-related and network location intangibles). The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. The determination of the final purchase price and acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized.
Revenue Recognition: Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned and when collectibility is reasonably assured, regardless of whether the payments from the tenants are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index or other 61 Table of Contents inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancellable terms of the applicable leases. Total rental and management straight-line revenues for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 approximated $147.7 million, $165.8 million and $144.0 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.
We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and approximately 55% of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on managements estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenants inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.
Rent Expense: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease, if the tenant exercises its renewal option. For towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease, we calculate our straight-line ground rent over the term of the ground lease, including all renewal options to fulfill the tenant lease obligation. In addition to the straight-line ground rent expense recorded, we also record an associated straight-line rent liability in Other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Leases may contain complex terms that often are subject to interpretation.
Stock-Based Compensation: We measure stock-based compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and recognize an expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. Effective January1, 2013, our Compensation Committee adopted a death, disability and retirement benefits program in connection with equity awards granted on or after January1, 2013 that provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employees death or permanent disability, or upon an employees qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, for grants made on or after January1, 2013, we recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation over the shorter of (i)the four-year vesting period or (ii)the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such retirement benefits, which may occur upon grant. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited. The fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, the expected distributions, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense. The fair value of restricted stock units is 62 Table of Contents based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation in either selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets.
Income Taxes: We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code effective January1, 2012, and are generally not subject to federal and state income taxes on our QRSs taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders provided that we meet certain organizational and operating requirements. However, even as a REIT, we will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our TRS assets. In addition, our international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.
Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We do not expect to pay federal taxes on our REIT taxable income.
We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability.
We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in managements judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.
We consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the United States.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued additional guidance on comprehensive income which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) by component. This guidance enhances the transparency of changes in other comprehensive income (OCI) and items transferred out of AOCI in the financial statements and it does not amend any existing requirements for reporting net income or OCI in the financial statements. Since the guidance relates only to presentation and disclosure of information, the adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements.
In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the scope of transactions subject to disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities. The guidance requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after 63 Table of Contents January1, 2013 on a retrospective basis. Since the guidance relates only to presentation and disclosure of information, the adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements.
In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance that requires an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, with certain exceptions. The amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2013, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

(b) Variable rate debt included the 2012 Credit Facility ($88.0 million), which matures on January31, 2017, the 2013 Credit Facility ($1.9billion), which matures on June28, 2018 and the 2013 Term Loan ($1.5 billion), which matures on January3, 2019. Variable rate debt also included $88.3 million of indebtedness outstanding under the South African Facility, which amortizes through March31, 2020, $66.9 million of indebtedness under the Uganda loan, which matures on June29, 2019, $70.1 million of indebtedness under the Colombian long-term credit facility, which amortizes through November30, 2020, $377.5 million of indebtedness under the Mexican Loan, which matures on May1, 2015 and $32.6 million of indebtedness under the Costa Rica Loan, which would have amortized through February16, 2019 (on February12, 2014, we repaid the Costa Rica Loan). Interest on the 2012 Credit Facility, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2013 Term Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The interest rate in effect at December31, 2013 for the 2012 Credit Facility, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2013 Term Loan was 1.795%, 1.42% and 1.42%, respectively. For the year ended December31, 2013, the weighted average interest rate under the 2011 Credit Facility, the 2012 Credit Facility, the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2012 Term Loan and the 2013 Term Loan was 1.73%. Interest on the South African Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate (JIBAR) agreement and accrues at JIBAR plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate at December31, 2013, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in South Africa, was 9.89%. Interest on the Uganda loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR plus margin (as defined). The Uganda loan accrued interest at 5.98% at December31, 2013. Interest on the Colombian long-term credit facility is payable in accordance with the applicable Inter-bank Rate (IBR) agreement and accrues at IBR plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate at December31, 2013, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in Colombia, was 10.13%. Interest on the Mexican Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable TIIE plus margin (as defined). The Mexican Loan accrued interest at 4.04% at December 31, 2013. Interest on the Costa Rica Loan is payable in accordance with LIBOR plus the applicable margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate at December31, 2013, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in Costa Rica, was 6.90%.
(c) Based on rates effective as of December31, 2013.
(d) Represents the weighted average fixed rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts.
65 Table of Contents We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in Colombia, Costa Rica and South Africa. All of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of $139.3 million, interest rates ranging from 1.62% to 7.83% and expiration dates through November 2020. On February12, 2014, we repaid the Costa Rica Loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap agreements.
Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December31, 2013, was comprised of $88.0 million under the 2012 Credit Facility, $1,853.0 million under the 2013 Credit Facility, $1,500.0 million under the 2013 Term Loan, $66.9 million under the Uganda loan, $43.6 million under the South African Facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, $17.5 million under the Colombian long-term credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, $377.5 million under the Mexican Loan and $5.6 million under the Costa Rica Loan after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $7.4 million of interest expense for the year ended December31, 2013.
We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S.Dollar is reported in U.S.Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S.Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity and as a component of comprehensive income (loss). We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations. For the year ended December31, 2013, approximately 33% of our revenues and approximately 40% of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.
We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December31, 2013. As of December31, 2013, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by approximately 3%.
As of December31, 2013, we have incurred a substantial amount of additional intercompany debt, which is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being of long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in approximately $228.6 million of unrealized gains or losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December31, 2013.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors.
66 Table of Contents Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2013 and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013. As discussed in Item1 of this Annual Report under the caption Business and in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we completed our acquisition of MIPT in October 2013. As permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC, we excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial reporting at MIPT, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting approximately 25% and 3%, respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2013.
In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992) . Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Deloitte& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on managements internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Item9A under the caption Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As set forth above, we excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial reporting at MIPT for the quarter and year ended December31, 2013. We consider the acquisition of MIPT material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and we are in the process of integrating the internal control procedures of MIPT into our internal control structure.
67 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of American Tower Corporation Boston, Massachusetts We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of American Tower Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at MIP Tower Holdings LLC, which was acquired on October1, 2013 and whose financial statements constitute 25% of total assets and 3% of total revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2013. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at MIP Tower Holdings LLC. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December31, 2013 of the Company and our report dated February25, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February25, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

F-7 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business American Tower Corporation is, through its various subsidiaries (collectively, ATC or the Company), an independent owner, operator and developer of wireless and broadcast communications real estate in the United States, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Ghana, India, Mexico, Panama, Peru, South Africa and Uganda. The Companys primary business is the leasing of antenna space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data and data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company also manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners, operates in-building and outdoor distributed antenna system (DAS) networks, holds property interests under third-party communications sites and provides network development services that primarily support its rental and management operations and the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. Since January1, 2012, the Company has been organized and has qualified as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
ATC is a holding company that conducts its operations through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and its joint ventures. ATCs principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. ATC conducts its international operations through its subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures.
In May 2011, the Company announced its intention to reorganize to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Effective December31, 2011, the Company completed the merger with its predecessor (American Tower) that was approved by American Towers stockholders in November 2011. At the time of the merger all outstanding shares of ClassA common stock of American Tower were converted into a right to receive an equal number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation. In addition, each share of ClassA common stock of American Tower held in treasury at December31, 2011 ceased to be outstanding, and a corresponding adjustment was recorded to additional paid in capital and common stock.
The Company holds and operates certain of its assets through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs). A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that is subject to applicable corporate income tax. The Companys use of TRSs enables it to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements and also allows the Company to retain income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement of distributing those earnings. The non-REIT qualified businesses that the Company holds through TRSs include most of its network development services segment. In addition, the Company has included most of its international operations and managed networks business within its TRSs.
As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on its income and gains that the Company distributes to its stockholders, including the income derived from leasing space on its towers. However, even as a REIT, the Company will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from its TRS operations. In addition, the Companys international assets and operations, including those designated as qualified REIT subsidiaries or other disregarded entities (collectively, QRSs), continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.
The Company may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs that hold certain of its operations to be treated as QRSs, and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from its TRSs to other subsidiaries, including QRSs. The Company changed the previous TRS election for certain of its Mexican subsidiaries to be treated as QRSs as of March1, 2013. In addition, the Company restructured certain of its domestic TRSs to be treated as QRSs as of January1, 2014.

Significant Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include impairment of long-lived assets (including goodwill), asset retirement obligations, revenue recognition, rent expense, stock-based compensation, income taxes and accounting for business combinations. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued as additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure.
Changes in Presentation Changes have been made to the presentation of certain footnotes as of December 31, 2012 to conform to the current year presentation.
Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company is subject to concentrations of credit risk related to its cash and cash equivalents, notes receivable, accounts receivable, deferred rent asset and derivative financial instruments. The Company mitigates its risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments by maintaining its deposits and contracts at high quality financial institutions and monitoring the credit ratings of those institutions.
The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues, corresponding accounts receivable and the related deferred rent asset from a relatively small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and approximately 55% of its current year revenues are derived from four tenants. In addition, the Company has concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas.
The Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables and the related deferred rent assets by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of its borrowers and tenants. In recognizing customer revenue, the Company must assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized in advance of billing on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on managements estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as collectibility is determined to be reasonably assured. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Accounts receivable is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenants inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. These allowances are generally estimated based on payment patterns, days past due and collection history, and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends, such as tenants in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowances when they are determined to be uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the F-9 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS particular conditions of the account. Changes in the allowances were as follows for the years ended December31, (in thousands): 2013 2012 2011 Balance as of January1 $ 20,406 $ 24,412 $ 22,505 Current year increases 7,025 8,028 17,008 Write-offs, net of recoveries and other (7,536 ) (12,034 ) (15,101 ) Balance as of December31 $ 19,895 $ 20,406 $ 24,412 Functional Currency The functional currency of the Companys foreign operating subsidiaries is the respective local currency, except for Costa Rica and Panama, where the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. All foreign currency assets and liabilities held by the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period. All foreign currency revenues and expenses are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and are the result of transactions of a subsidiary being denominated in a currency other than its functional currency. In addition, intercompany notes with balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiarys functional currency, with the exception of those whose payment is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future, are subject to remeasurement based on the exchange rate in effect at the end of the reporting period. The effect of this remeasurement is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss prior to repayment and is reflected in Other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments, including money market funds, with remaining maturities of three months or less when acquired, whose cost approximates fair value.
Restricted Cash The Company classifies as restricted cash all cash pledged as collateral to secure obligations and all cash whose use is otherwise limited by contractual provisions, including cash on deposit in reserve accounts relating to the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013-2A issued in the Companys securitization transaction (the Securities), the Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2010-1 Class C, Series 2010-2 Class C and Series 2010-2 Class F (collectively, the Unison Notes), assumed by the Company as a result of the acquisition of certain legal entities from Unison Holdings, LLC and Unison Site Management II, L.L.C. (collectively, Unison), and six series, consisting of eleven separate classes, of Secured Tower Revenue Notes (collectively, the GTP Notes) assumed by the Company as a result of the Companys acquisition of MIP Tower Holdings LLC (see note 6).
Short-Term Investments Short-term investments include highly-liquid investments with original maturities in excess of three months when acquired.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost or, in the case of acquired properties, at estimated fair value on the date acquired. Cost for self-constructed towers includes direct materials and labor, capitalized interest and certain indirect costs associated with construction of the tower, such as transportation costs, employee benefits and payroll taxes.The Company begins the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period, which is the period during which costs are incurred to evaluate the site, and continues to capitalize costs until the tower is substantially completed and ready for occupancy by a tenant.Labor costs capitalized for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $44.1 million, $41.6 million and $35.6 million, respectively.Interest costs capitalized for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $1.8 million, $1.9 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
F-10 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Augmentation and improvements that extend an assets useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.
Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives. Towers and related assets on leased land are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the corresponding ground lease, taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value.
Towers or assets acquired through capital leases are reflected in Property and equipment, net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment, network location intangibles and assets held under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not exceeding twenty years.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
The Companys goodwill is recorded in its domestic and international rental and management segments and network development services segment. The Company utilizes the two-step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and employs a discounted cash flow analysis.
The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, managements expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital, and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the Company conducts the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess.
During the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying value.
Intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from three to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Deferred Rent Asset The Companys deferred rent asset is associated with non-cancellable tenant leases that contain fixed escalation clauses over the terms of the applicable lease in which revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Notes Receivable and Other Non-Current Assets Notes receivable and other non-current assets primarily consists of prepaid ground lease assets, value added tax receivable, notes receivable from TV Azteca, long-term deposits, favorable leasehold interests and other non-current assets.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are F-11 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS recognized in the results of operations. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs.
The primary risk managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure on the variable rate debt under its credit facilities and to manage variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. The Companys credit risk exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform. The Company may also enter into forward starting interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements, which the Company designates as cash flow hedges, to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments in connection with the likely issuance of new fixed rate debt. Settlement gains and losses on terminations of these forward starting interest rate swap agreements are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized to interest expense over the term of the newly issued debt.
The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes.
The Company may also enter into foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the risk of currency fluctuations. These transactions do not typically qualify for hedge accounting, and as a result, the associated gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.
Fair Value Measurements The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
Discount and Premium on Notes The Company amortizes the discounts and premiums on its notes using the effective interest method over the term of the obligation. Such amortization is reflected in Interest expense and Interest income, TV Azteca, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Asset Retirement Obligations The Company has certain obligations related to tower assets, which are principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of the Companys tower assets are located, that require the recognition of an asset retirement obligation. The fair value of asset retirement obligations associated with an entitys obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and can be reasonably estimated. Such asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the assets estimated useful life. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion in the consolidated statements of operations. Adjustments are also made to the asset retirement obligation liability to reflect changes in the estimates of timing and amount of expected cash flows, with an offsetting adjustment made to the related tangible long-lived asset.
The significant assumptions used in estimating the Companys aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates that approximate the Companys incremental borrowing rate.
Income Taxes As a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to federal income taxes on income and gains distributed to the Companys stockholders. However, the Company remains obligated to pay income taxes on F-12 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS earnings from domestic TRSs. In addition, the Companys international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or where those operations are conducted, including those designated as QRSs for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized within a reasonable period of time. The Company also periodically reviews its valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized.
The Company classifies uncertain tax positions as non-current income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the income tax provision and interest income from tax refunds as a component of Other income in the consolidated statements of operations.
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are included in other comprehensive income (loss), but excluded from net income, as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to equity, net of tax. The Companys other comprehensive income (loss) is primarily comprised of changes in fair value of effective derivative cash flow hedges, unrealized losses in available-for-sale securities, foreign currency translation adjustments and reclassification of unrealized losses on effective derivative cash flow hedges and available-for-sale securities.
Treasury Stock The Company records treasury stock purchases using the cost method, whereby the purchase price, including legal costs and commissions, is recorded in a contra equity account, Treasury stock. The equity accounts from which the shares were originally issued are not adjusted for any treasury stock purchases unless and until such time as the shares are formally retired or reissued. As part of the Companys conversion to a REIT, all treasury stock outstanding at the time was retired.
Distributions During the year ended December31, 2011, the Company paid a one-time special cash distribution to its stockholders of approximately $137.8 million, or $0.35 per share, of earnings and profits accumulated during the years it was taxed as a C corporation, in anticipation of commencing to operate as a REIT effective January1, 2012. As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). During the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company declared and paid distributions of its REIT taxable income of an aggregate of $434.5 million or $1.10 per share and $355.6 million, or $0.90 per share, respectively. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Companys control, including the financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, the Companys ability to utilize net operating losses (NOLs) to offset, in whole or in part, the Companys distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.
F-13 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Acquisitions For transactions that meet the definition of a business combination, the Company allocates the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. For transactions that do not meet the definition of a business combination, the Company first allocates the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets (primarily acquired customer-related and network location intangibles). The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset, adjusted for an estimated reduction in fair value due to depreciation, and the economic useful life. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future cash flows. The determination of the final purchase price and the acquisition-date fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized in the prior period financial statements.
Revenue Recognition Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned and when collectibility is reasonably assured. Fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with the Companys tenants are recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancellable terms of the applicable leases and included in the Deferred rent asset on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total rental and management straight-line revenues for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 approximated $147.7 million, $165.8 million and $144.0 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the initial terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.
Network development services revenues are derived under contracts or arrangements with customers that provide for billings either on a fixed price basis or a variable price basis, which includes factors such as time and expenses. Revenues are recognized as services are performed. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.
Rent Expense Many of the leases underlying the Companys tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable by the Company over time. The Company calculates straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to the Company such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Certain of the Companys tenant leases require the Company to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. For towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease, the Company calculates its straight-line ground rent over the term of the ground lease, including all renewal options required to fulfill the tenant lease obligation.
Total rental and management straight-line ground rent expense for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 approximated $29.7 million, $33.7 million and $31.0 million, respectively. In addition to the straight-line ground rent expense recorded by the Company, the Company also records its straight-line rent liability in Other non-current liabilities and records prepaid ground rent in Prepaid and other current assets and Notes receivable and other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
F-14 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general and administrative expense consists of overhead expenses related to the Companys rental and management and services operations and corporate overhead costs not specifically allocable to any of the Companys individual business operations. Development expense consists of costs related to the Companys acquisition efforts, costs associated with new business initiatives and abandoned site and acquisition costs.
Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. Effective January1, 2013, the Companys Compensation Committee adopted a death, disability and retirement benefits program in connection with equity awards granted on or after January1, 2013 that provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employees death or permanent disability, or upon an employees qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, for grants made on or after January1, 2013, the Company recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation over the shorter of (i)the four-year vesting period or (ii)the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such retirement benefits, which may occur upon grant. The expense recognized over the service period includes an estimate of awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited. The Company calculates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of restricted stock units based on the fair value of the units at the grant date. The Companys stock-based compensation expense is recognized in either Selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or capitalized as part of the Companys cost to construct tower assets.
Litigation Costs The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business. The Company regularly monitors the status of pending legal actions to evaluate both the magnitude and likelihood of any potential loss. The Company accrues for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss, or possible range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies or litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those liabilities may be required. The Company also incurs legal costs in connection with these matters and records estimates of these expenses, which arereflected in Selling, general, administrativeand development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses includes the costs incurred by the Company in conjunction with acquisitions and mergers (including changes in estimated fair value of contingent consideration), impairments on long-lived assets and gains and losses recognized upon the disposal of long-lived assets and other discrete items of a non-recurring nature.
The Company reviews long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Companys assets may not be recoverable.
The Company reviews its tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its customer-related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the related assets will be recovered, either through projected undiscounted future cash flows or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets. If the Company determines that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company will measure any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market F-15 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS information relative to the assets fair value, as compared to the assets carrying value. The Company records any related impairment charge in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.
Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations Loss on retirement of long-term obligations primarily includes cash paid to retire debt in excess of its carrying value and non-cash charges related to the write-off of deferred financing fees.
Earnings Per Common Share  Basic and Diluted Basic income from continuing operations per common share represents income from continuing operations attributable to American Tower Corporation divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income from continuing operations per common share represents income from continuing operations attributable to American Tower Corporation divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and any dilutive common share equivalents, including unvested restricted stock and shares issuable upon exercise of stock options as determined under the treasury stock method. Dilutive common share equivalents also include the dilutive impact of the Verizon transaction (see note19).
Retirement Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain age and employment requirements. For the year ended December31, 2013, the Company matched 75% of the first 6% of a participants contributions. The Companys matching contribution for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011 was 50% of the first 6% of a participants contributions. For the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company contributed approximately $6.0 million, $4.4 million and $2.9 million to the plan, respectively.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued additional guidance on comprehensive income which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) by component. This guidance enhances the transparency of changes in other comprehensive income (OCI) and items transferred out of AOCI in the financial statements and it does not amend any existing requirements for reporting net income or OCI in the financial statements. Since the guidance relates only to presentation and disclosure of information, the adoption did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.
In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the scope of transactions subject to disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities. The guidance requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after January1, 2013 on a retrospective basis. Since the guidance relates only to presentation and disclosure of information, the adoption did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.
In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance that requires an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, with certain exceptions. The amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2013, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.

F-18 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The acquired network location intangible represents the value to the Company of the incremental revenue growth which could potentially be obtained from leasing the excess capacity on acquired communications sites. The acquired customer-related intangibles typically represent the value to the Company of customer contracts and relationships in place at the time of an acquisition, including assumptions regarding estimated renewals. During the year ended December31, 2013, the Company retired $19.6 million of intangible assets related to non-competition agreements that had expired and were fully amortized.
The Company amortizes its acquired network intangibles and customer-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. As of December31, 2013, the remaining weighted average amortization period of the Companys intangible assets, excluding the TV Azteca Economic Rights, is approximately 16 years. Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 aggregated approximately $282.5 million, $207.3 million and $176.4 million (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs, which is included in interest expense), respectively. Based on current exchange rates, the Company expects to record amortization expense (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) as follows over the next five years (in millions): Year Ending December31, 2014 $ 426.1 2015 423.3 2016 420.5 2017 418.0 2018 415.8 5.NOTES RECEIVABLE AND OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS Notes receivable and other non-current assets consists of the following as of December31, (in thousands): 2013 2012 Long-term prepaid ground rent $ 176,313 $ 158,935 Notes receivable 89,381 114,256 Other miscellaneous assets 179,310 179,597 Balance as of December31, $ 445,004 $ 452,788 TV Azteca Note Receivable In 2000, the Company loaned TV Azteca, S.A. de C.V. (TV Azteca), the owner of a major national television network in Mexico, $119.8 million. The loan has an interest rate of 13.11%, payable quarterly, which at the time of issuance was determined to be below market and therefore a corresponding discount was recorded. The term of the loan is seventy years; however, the loan may be prepaid by TV Azteca without penalty during the last fifty years of the agreement. The discount on the loan is being amortized to Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense, using the effective interest method over the seventy-year term of the loan. During the year ended December31, 2013, TV Azteca made a payment of $34.4 million, which included $28.0 million of principal on the loan, related interest and a prepayment penalty of $4.9 million in accordance with the terms of the agreement. In addition, the Company recorded additional interest income of $2.7 million related to the write-off of a portion of the unamortized discount associated with the original loan. As of December31, 2013, the outstanding balance on the loan is $91.8 million, or $82.9 million net of discount.
Simultaneous with the signing of the loan agreement, the Company also entered into a seventy-year Economic Rights Agreement with TV Azteca regarding space not used by TV Azteca on approximately 190 of its broadcast F-19 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS towers. In exchange for the issuance of the below market interest rate loan and the annual payment of $1.5 million to TV Azteca (under the Economic Rights Agreement), the Company has the right to market and lease the unused tower space on the broadcast towers (the Economic Rights). TV Azteca retains title to these towers and is responsible for their operation and maintenance. The Company is entitled to 100% of the revenues generated from leases with tenants on the unused space and is responsible for any incremental operating expenses associated with those tenants.
The term of the Economic Rights Agreement is seventy years; however, TV Azteca has the right to purchase, at fair market value, the Economic Rights from the Company at any time during the last fifty years of the agreement. Should TV Azteca elect to purchase the Economic Rights (in whole or in part), it would also be obligated to repay a proportional amount of the loan discussed above at the time of such election. The Companys obligation to pay TV Azteca $1.5 million annually would also be reduced proportionally.
The Company has accounted for the annual payment of $1.5 million as a capital lease (initially recording an asset and a corresponding liability of approximately $18.6 million). The capital lease asset and the original discount on the note, which aggregated approximately $30.2 million, represent the cost to acquire the Economic Rights, which is recorded as an intangible asset and is being amortized over the seventy-year life of the Economic Rights Agreement.
6.ACQUISITIONS All of the acquisitions described below are being accounted for as business combinations and are consistent with the Companys strategy to expand in selected geographic areas.
The estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the applicable acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the particular acquisition date). The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible, intangible, real property and other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, and residual goodwill and any related tax impact. The fair values of these net assets acquired are based on managements preliminary estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. While the Company believes that such preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, it will evaluate any necessary information prior to finalization of the fair value. During the measurement period, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of that date. The effect of measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values is reflected as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date. The impact of all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could be subject to a possible impairment of the intangible assets or goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of intangible assets in subsequent periods. During the year ended December31, 2013, the Company made certain purchase accounting measurement period adjustments related to several acquisitions and therefore retrospectively adjusted the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2012.
Impact of current year acquisitions The Company typically acquires communications sites from wireless carriers or other tower operators and subsequently integrates those sites into its existing portfolio of communications sites. The financial results of the Companys acquisitions have been included in the Companys consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December31, 2013 from the date of respective acquisition. The date of acquisition, and by extension the point at which the Company begins to recognize the results of an acquisition, may be dependent upon, among other things, the receipt of contractual consents, the F-20 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS commencement and extent of leasing arrangements and the timing of the transfer of title or rights to the assets, which may be accomplished in phases. For sites acquired from communication service providers, these sites may never have been operated as a business and were utilized solely by the seller as a component of their network infrastructure. An acquisition, depending on its size and nature, may or may not involve the transfer of business operations or employees.
The estimated aggregate impact of the 2013 acquisitions on the Companys revenues and gross margin for the year ended December31, 2013 is approximately $129.8 million and $94.5 million, respectively. The revenues and gross margin amounts also reflect incremental revenues from the addition of new tenants to the acquired sites subsequent to the date of acquisition. Incremental amounts of segment selling, general, administrative and development expense have not been reflected as the amounts attributable to acquisitions are not comparable.
The Company recognizes acquisition and merger related costs as expenses in the period in which they are incurred and services are received. Acquisition and merger related costs may include finders fees, advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees and general administrative costs and are included in Other operating expenses. During the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized acquisition and merger related expenses, including the fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, of $36.2 million, $25.6 million and $28.1 million, respectively.
MIPT Acquisition On October1, 2013, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary American Tower Investments LLC, acquired 100% of the outstanding common membership interests of MIP Tower Holdings LLC (MIPT), a private REIT and the parent company of Global Tower Partners (GTP), an owner and operator, through its various operating subsidiaries, of approximately 4,860 communications sites in the United States and approximately 510 communications sites in Costa Rica and Panama. GTP also manages rooftops and holds property interests that it leases to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. MIPTs revenues and gross margin for the period from the acquisition date through December31, 2013 were $84.1 million and $65.0 million, respectively.
The preliminary purchase price of $4.9 billion was satisfied with approximately $3.3 billion in cash, including an aggregate of approximately $2.8 billion from borrowings under the Companys credit facilities, and the assumption of approximately $1.5 billion of MIPTs existing indebtedness.
The consideration transferred consists of the following (in thousands): Cash consideration (1) $ 3,330,462 Assumption of existing indebtedness at historical cost 1,527,621 Estimated total purchase price $ 4,858,083 (1) Cash consideration includes $14.5 million of an additional purchase price adjustment which was paid to the sellers subsequent to December31, 2013.

Pro Forma Consolidated Results The following pro forma information presents the financial results as if the 2013 acquisitions, including the acquisition of MIPT, had occurred on January1, 2012 (in thousands, except per share data). Management relied on various estimates and assumptions due to the fact that some of the 2013 acquisitions never operated as a business and were utilized solely by the seller as a component of their network infrastructure. As a result, F-23 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS historical operating results for these acquisitions are not available. The pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost synergies, costs or other effects of the planned integration of the 2013 acquisitions. Accordingly, such pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results that actually would have occurred had the acquisitions been completed on the dates indicated, nor are they indicative of the future operating results of the Company.

Colombia Under the terms of the agreement with Colombia Movil S.A. E.S.P. (Colombia Movil), the Company is required to make additional payments upon the conversion of certain barter agreements with other wireless carriers to cash paying lease agreements. Based on current estimates, the Company expects the value of potential contingent consideration payments required to be made under the agreement to be between zero and $36.7 million and estimates it to be $23.0 million using a probability weighted average of the expected outcomes at December31, 2013. During the year ended December31, 2013, the Company recorded additional contingent consideration of $4.1 million related to acquisitions during the period and recorded an increase in fair value of $3.1 million in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Ghana Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, with MTN Group Limited, the Company is required to make additional payments upon the conversion of certain barter agreements with other wireless carriers to cash paying lease agreements. Based on current estimates, the Company expects the value of potential contingent consideration payments required to be made under the amended agreement to be between zero and $0.7 million and estimates it to be $0.7 million using a probability weighted average of the expected outcomes at December31, 2013.

The Company initially recorded $9.3 million of contingent consideration liability as part of the preliminary purchase price allocation upon closing of the acquisition. Based on current estimates, the Company expects the value of potential contingent consideration payments required to be made under the amended agreement to be between zero and $12.7 million and estimates it to be $8.1 million using a probability weighted average of the expected outcomes at December31, 2013. In addition, during the three months ended December31, 2013, the Company recorded a decrease in fair value of $0.5 million in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and made payments under this agreement of $0.7 million.

Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 During the year ended December31, 2007, the Company completed a securitization transaction (the 2007 Securitization) involving assets related to 5,295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the Company through a private offering of $1.75 billion of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 (the Certificates).On March15, 2013, the Company repaid all indebtedness outstanding under the Certificates ($1.75 billion in principal amount), plus prepayment consideration and accrued interest thereon and other costs and expenses related thereto, with proceeds from the offering of $1.8 billion of the Securities, as described in more detail below. The Company recorded a Loss on retirement of long-term obligations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations of $35.3 million, consisting of prepayment consideration of $29.2 million and the expense of deferred financing costs of $6.1 million.
Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013-2A OnMarch15, 2013, the Company completed a securitization transaction (the Securitization) involving assets related to 5,195 wireless and broadcast communications towers (the Secured Towers) owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the Company, through a private offering of $1.8 billion of the Securities. The net proceeds of the transaction were $1.78 billion. The Securities were issued by American Tower Trust I (the Trust), a trust established by American Tower Depositor Sub, LLC (the Depositor), an indirect wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of the Company.The assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan (the Loan) to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (the Borrowers), pursuant to a First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March15, 2013 (the Loan Agreement).The Borrowers are special purpose entities formed solely for the purpose of holding the Secured Towers subject to a securitization.
The Securities were issued in two separate series of the same class pursuant to a First Amended and Restated Trust and Servicing Agreement (the Trust Agreement), with terms identical to the Loan.The effective weighted average life and interest rate of the Securities is 8.6years and 2.648%, respectively, as of the date of issuance.
F-29 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Amounts due under the Loan will be paid by the Borrowers from the cash flows generated by the Secured Towers.These funds in turn will be used by or on behalf of the Trust to service the payment of interest on the Securities and for any other payments required by the Loan Agreement or Trust Agreement.The Borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the Loan.Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be made prior to March15, 2018, which is the anticipated repayment date for the component of the Loan associated with the Series 2013-1A Securities. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the Loan Agreement and Trust Agreement, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the Secured Towers are released to the Borrowers, and can then be distributed to, and used by, the Company.However, if the debt service coverage ratio (the DSCR), generally defined as the net cash flow divided by the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months on the principal amount of the Loan, as of the last day of any calendar quarter prior to the applicable anticipated repayment date, were equal to or below 1.30x (the Cash Trap DSCR) for such quarter, and the DSCR continues to be equal to or below the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. An amortization period commences if (i)as of the end of any calendar quarter the DSCR equals or falls below 1.15x (the Minimum DSCR) for such calendar quarter and such amortization period will continue to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters or (ii)on the anticipated repayment date the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Securities has not been repaid in full, provided that such amortization period shall apply with respect to such component that has not been repaid in full. During an amortization period all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to payment of the principal on the Loan.
The Borrowers may prepay the Loan in whole or in part at any time provided it is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration.If the prepayment occurs within twelve months of the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2013-1A Securities or eighteen months of the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2013-2A Securities, no prepayment consideration is due.The entire unpaid principal balance of the component of the Loan related to the Series 2013-1A Securities and the Series 2013-2A Securities will be due in March 2043 and March 2048, respectively. The Loan may be defeased in whole at any time prior to the anticipated repayment date for any component of the Loan then outstanding.
The Loan is secured by (1)mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Secured Towers, (2)a pledge of the Borrowers operating cash flows from the Secured Towers, (3)a security interest in substantially all of the Borrowers personal property and fixtures and (4)the Borrowers rights under the tenant leases and the management agreement entered into in connection with the Securitization. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the Borrowers, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC, whose only material asset is its equity interest in American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, each have guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations.American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC, American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, the Depositor and the Borrowers each were formed as special purpose entities solely for purposes of entering a securitization transaction, and the assets and credit of these entities are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of the Company or any other person, except as set forth in the Loan Agreement.
The Loan Agreement includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for F-30 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement). The organizational documents of the Borrowers contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that the Borrowers maintain at least two independent directors.The Loan Agreement also contains certain covenants that require the Borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Loan Agreement and other agreements related to the Secured Towers, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the Secured Towers, including the right to conduct site investigations.
A failure to comply with the covenants in the Loan Agreement could prevent the Borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the Secured Towers, and could prevent the Borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of the Secured Towers to the Company. If the Borrowers were to default on the Loan, the servicer could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the Secured Towers, in which case the Company could lose the Secured Towers and the revenue associated with those assets.
Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums, and to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Secured Towers. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement, all rental cash receipts received for each month are reserved for the succeeding month and held in an account controlled by the trustee and then released. The $103.2 million held in the reserve accounts as of December31, 2013 is classified as Restricted cash on the Companys accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
GTP Notes In connection with the acquisition of MIPT, the Company assumed approximately $1.49 billion principal amount of existing indebtedness under the GTP Notes issued by certain subsidiaries of GTP in several securitization transactions. The Series 2010-1 notes were issued by GTP Towers Issuer, LLC (GTP Towers), the Series 2011-1 notes, Series 2011-2 notes and Series 2013-1 notes were issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (GTP Partners) and the Series 2012-1 notes and Series 2012-2 notes were issued by GTP Cellular Sites, LLC (GTP Cellular Sites, and together with GTP Towers and GTP Partners, the GTP Issuers). The following table sets forth certain terms of the GTP Notes: GTP Notes Issue Date Original Principal Amount (in thousands) InterestRate Anticipated Repayment Date Final Maturity Date Series 2010-1 Class C notes February17,2010 $ 200,000 4.436 % February15, 2015 February15, 2040 Series 2010-1 Class F notes February17, 2010 $ 50,000 8.112 % February15,2015 February15,2040 Series 2011-1 Class C notes March11, 2011 $ 70,000 3.967 % June15, 2016 June15, 2041 Series 2011-2 Class C notes July7, 2011 $ 490,000 4.347 % June15, 2016 June15, 2041 Series 2011-2 Class F notes July7, 2011 $ 155,000 7.628 % June15, 2016 June15, 2041 Series 2012-1 ClassA notes (1) February28, 2012 $ 100,000 3.721 % March15,2017 March15, 2042 Series 2012-2 ClassA notes (1) February28, 2012 $ 114,000 4.336 % March15, 2019 March15, 2042 Series 2012-2 Class B notes February28, 2012 $ 41,000 6.413 % March15, 2019 March15,2042 Series 2012-2 Class C notes February28, 2012 $ 27,000 7.358 % March15, 2019 March15, 2042 Series 2013-1 Class C notes April24, 2013 $ 190,000 2.364 % May15, 2018 May15, 2043 Series 2013-1 Class F notes April24, 2013 $ 55,000 4.704 % May15, 2018 May15, 2043 (1) Does not reflect MIPTs repayment of approximately $1.4 million aggregate principal amount prior to the date of acquisition and the Companys repayment of approximately $0.7 million aggregate principal amount after the date of acquisition in accordance with the repayment schedules.
The GTP Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time beginning two years after the date of issuance, provided such payment is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within F-31 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS six months of the anticipated repayment date, with respect to the Series 2010-1 notes, or one year of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the other GTP Notes, no prepayment consideration is due.
As of December31, 2013, the GTP Notes are secured by, among other things, an aggregate of 3,893 sites and 1,717 property interests owned by subsidiaries of the GTP Issuers and other related assets (the GTP Secured Towers).
Amounts due under the GTP Notes will be paid from the cash flows generated by the GTP Secured Towers that secure the applicable series of GTP Notes.These funds in turn will be used to service the payment of interest on the applicable series of GTP Notes and for any other payments required by the indentures governing the GTP Notes (the GTP Indentures).
On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the GTP Indentures, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the GTP Secured Towers are released to the GTP Issuers, and can then be distributed to, and used by, the Company. The GTP Issuers must maintain a specified ratio with respect to their DSCR, calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable GTP Indentures) to the amount of interest required to be paid over the succeeding twelve months on the principal amount of the GTP Notes that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination, plus the amount of the payable trustee and servicing fees.If the DSCR with respect to any series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Towers or GTP Partners is equal to or below 1.30x (GTP Cash Trap DSCR) at the end of any calendar quarter and it continues for two consecutive calendar quarters, or if the DSCR with respect to any series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites is equal to or below the Cash Trap DSCR at the end of any calendar month and it continues for two consecutive calendar months, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required with respect to such series of GTP Notes under the GTP Indentures, will be deposited into reserve accounts instead of being released to the GTP Issuers. The funds in the reserve accounts will not be released to GTP Towers or GTP Partners for distribution to the Company unless the DSCR with respect to such series of GTP Notes exceeds the GTP Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Likewise, the funds in the reserve account will not be released to GTP Cellular Sites for distribution to the Company unless the DSCR with respect to such series of GTP Notes exceeds the GTP Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar months. Additionally, an amortization period, commences as of the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Towers and GTP Partners, and as of the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites, if the DSCR of such series equals or falls below 1.15x (the GTP Minimum DSCR). The amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Towers and GTP Partners, for which the DSCR exceeds the GTP Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Similarly, the amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites, for which the DSCR exceeds the GTP Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar months. During an amortization period all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the GTP Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to payment of the principal of the applicable series of GTP Notes.
The GTP Indentures include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for note offerings subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the GTP Issuers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary exceptions for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the GTP Indentures). The GTP Indentures also contain certain covenants that require the GTP Issuers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports, operating budgets and budgets for capital improvements not included in annual financial statements in accordance with GAAP, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the GTP Indentures and other F-32 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS agreements related to the GTP Secured Towers, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the GTP Secured Towers, including the right to conduct site investigations.
A failure to comply with the covenants in the GTP Indentures could prevent the GTP Issuers from taking certain actions with respect to the GTP Secured Towers and could prevent the GTP Issuers from distributing excess cash flow to the Company. In addition, upon occurrence and during an event of default, the trustee may, in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of GTP Notes, declare such series of GTP Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such GTP Notes. Furthermore, if the GTP Issuers were to default on a series of the GTP Notes, the trustee may demand, collect, take possession of, receive, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the GTP Secured Towers securing such series, in which case GTP Issuers could lose the GTP Secured Towers and the revenue associated with those assets.
Under the GTP Indentures, the GTP Issuers are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for amounts received or due from tenants related to future periods, property taxes, insurance, ground rents, certain expenses and debt service. The $26.8 million held in the reserve accounts as of December31, 2013 is classified as Restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Costa Rica Loan In connection with the acquisition of MIPT, the Company assumed $32.6 million of secured debt in Costa Rica (the Costa Rica Loan). The interest rate under the Costa Rica Loan is the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 5.50%, or 5.744% as of December31, 2013. The loan agreement requires that the Company manage exposure to variability in interest rates on at least seventy percent of the amounts outstanding under the Costa Rica Loan. Accordingly, as of December31, 2013, the Company holds three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $42.0 million with certain of the lenders under the Costa Rica Loan. After giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements, the facility accrues interest at a weighted average rate of 6.90%. On February12, 2014, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the Costa Rica Loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap agreements.
Unison Notes In connection with the Unison acquisition, the Company assumed $196.0 million of existing indebtedness with an acquisition date fair value of $209.3 million under the Unison Notes issued by Unison Ground Lease Funding, LLC (the Unison Issuer) in a securitization transaction (the Unison Securitization). The three classes of Unison Notes bear interest at rates of 5.349%, 6.392% and 9.522%, respectively, with anticipated repayment dates of April15, 2017,April15, 2020 and April15, 2020, respectively, and a final maturity date of April15, 2040.
The Unison Notes are secured by, among other things, liens on approximately 1,470 real property interests owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the Unison Issuer (together with the Unison Issuer, the Unison Obligors) and other related assets. The indenture for the Unison Notes (the Unison Indenture) includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for notes subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Unison Obligors are restricted from incurring other indebtedness or further encumbering their assets.
Under the terms of the Unison Indenture, the Unison Notes will be paid from the cash flows generated by the communications sites subject to the Unison Securitization. The Unison Issuer is required to make monthly payments of interest to holders of the Unison Notes. On a monthly basis, cash flows in excess of amounts needed to make debt service payments and other payments required under the Unison Indenture are to be distributed to the Unison Issuer, which may then be distributed to, and used by, the Company. The Unison Issuer may prepay the Unison Notes in whole or in part at any time, provided such payment is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within six months of the anticipated repayment date, no prepayment consideration is due.
F-33 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A failure to comply with the covenants in the Unison Indenture could prevent the Unison Obligors from taking certain actions with respect to the property interests subject to the Unison Securitization and a failure to meet certain financial ratio tests could prevent excess cash flow from being distributed to the Unison Issuer. In addition, if the Unison Issuer were to default on the Unison Notes, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon the property interests subject to the Unison Securitization, in which case the Company could lose ownership of the property interests and the revenue associated with those property interests.
Colombian Bridge Loans In connection with the acquisition of communications sites in Colombia, one of the Companys Colombian subsidiaries entered into five COP denominated bridge loans for an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 94.0 billion COP (approximately $48.8 million), and on August6, 2013, entered into an additional 14.0 billion COP bridge loan (approximately $7.3 million).
Mexican Loan On November1, 2013, in connection with the acquisition of towers in Mexico from NII, one of the Companys Mexican subsidiaries entered into a 5.2 billion MXN denominated unsecured bridge loan (the Mexican Loan). On November5, 2013, the Mexican subsidiary borrowed approximately 4.9 billion MXN (approximately $374.7 million). The Mexican subsidiary maintains the ability to draw down the remaining 0.3 billion MXN under the Mexican Loan until February28, 2014. The Mexican Loan bears interest at a margin over the Equilibrium Interbank Interest Rate (TIIE). The interest rate will range between 0.25% and 1.50% above TIIE, pursuant to a schedule set forth in the credit agreement. As of December31, 2013, the current margin over TIIE is 0.25%, which results in an interest rate of 4.040%.
Ghana Loan In connection with the establishment of the Companys joint venture with MTN Group and acquisitions of communications sites in Ghana, Ghana Tower Interco B.V., a 51% owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a U.S.Dollar-denominated shareholder loan agreement (Ghana Loan), as the borrower, with a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (ATC Ghana Subsidiary) and a wholly owned subsidiary of MTN Ghana (the MTN Ghana Subsidiary), as the lenders. Pursuant to the terms of the Ghana Loan, loans were made to the joint venture in connection with the acquisition of communications sites from MTN Ghana. Pursuant to the loan agreement, accrued interest was periodically capitalized and added to the principal amount outstanding through November 2013. The portion of the loans made by the ATC Ghana Subsidiary is eliminated in consolidation and the portion of the loans made by the MTN Ghana Subsidiary is reported as outstanding debt of the Company.
Uganda Loan In connection with the establishment of the Companys joint venture with MTN Group and acquisitions of communications sites in Uganda, Uganda Tower Interco B.V., a 51% owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a U.S.Dollar-denominated shareholder loan agreement (the Uganda Loan), as the borrower, with a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the ATC Uganda Subsidiary) and a wholly owned subsidiary of MTN Uganda (the MTN Uganda Subsidiary), as the lenders. The Uganda Loan accrues interest at 5.30% above LIBOR, reset annually, which results in an interest rate of 5.984% as of December31, 2013. Pursuant to the loan agreement, accrued interest is periodically capitalized and added to the principal amount outstanding through December 2014. The portion of the Uganda Loan made by the ATC Uganda Subsidiary is eliminated in consolidation, and the portion of the Uganda Loan made by the MTN Uganda Subsidiary is reported as outstanding debt of the Company.
South African Facility In connection with the Companys expansion initiatives in South Africa, one of the Companys South African subsidiaries (the SA Borrower) entered into a 1.2 billion ZAR denominated credit facility (the South African Facility) in November 2011.During the year ended December31, 2013, the SA Borrower borrowed an additional 116.3million ZAR (approximately $12.0 million) and repaid 23.8million ZAR (approximately $2.5 million).On September30, 2013, the SA Borrowers ability to draw on the South African Facility expired.
F-34 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Principal and interest are payable quarterly in arrears with principal due in accordance with the repayment schedule included in the loan agreement. Outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. Commencing twenty-four months after financial close, the South African Facility may be prepaid in whole or in part without prepayment consideration.
The South African Facility is secured by, among other things, liens on towers owned by the SA Borrower. The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial ratios and operating covenants. Failure to comply with certain of the financial and operating covenants would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. Under the terms of the South African Facility, interest is payable quarterly at a rate generally equal to 3.75%per annum, plus the three month Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate (JIBAR), which results in an interest rate of 8.967% as of December31, 2013. The loan agreement requires that the SA Borrower manage exposure to variability in interest rates on at least fifty percent of the amounts outstanding under the South African Facility. Accordingly, as of December31, 2013, the SA Borrower holds fifteen interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of 469.4million ZAR (approximately $44.7 million) with certain of the lenders under the South African Facility. After giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements, the facility accrues interest at a weighted average rate of 9.89%.
Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility On October19, 2012, one of the Companys Colombian subsidiaries (ATC Sitios) entered into a loan agreement for a COP denominated long-term credit facility (the Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility), which it used to refinance the previously existing COP denominated short-term credit facility on November30, 2012.
Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility may be prepaid in whole or in part, subject to certain limitations and prepayment consideration, at any time.
Principal and interest are payable quarterly in arrears with principal due in accordance with the repayment schedule included in the loan agreement. Interest accrues at a per annum rate equal to 5.00% above the quarterly advanced Inter-bank Rate (IBR) in effect at the beginning of each Interest Period (as defined in the loan agreement), which results in an interest rate of 8.166% as of December31, 2013. The loan agreement also requires that ATC Sitios manage exposure to variability in interest rates on at least fifty percent of the amounts outstanding under the Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility for the first four years of the loan, and seventy-five percent thereafter. Accordingly, ATC Sitios entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an aggregate notional value of 101.3 billion COP (approximately $52.5 million) with certain of the lenders under the Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility on December5, 2012. As of December31, 2013, the interest rate, after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements, is 10.13%.
The Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility is secured by, among other things, liens on towers owned by ATC Sitios. The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial ratios and operating covenants. Failure to comply with certain of the financial and operating covenants would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.

The 2013 Credit Facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the Companys option without penalty or premium.
The Company has the option of choosing either a defined base rate or LIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the 2013 Credit Facility.

The current margin over LIBOR that the Company incurs on borrowings is 1.250%, which results in an interest rate of 1.420% as of December31, 2013. The current commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the new credit facility is 0.150%.
The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which the Company must comply.

The current margin over LIBOR that the Company would incur (should it choose LIBOR) on borrowings is 1.250% and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion is 0.150%.
The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which the Company must comply. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants would not only prevent the Company from being able to borrow additional funds, but would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.

11.DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company is exposed to certain risks related to its ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate protection agreements to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. The Companys credit risk exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform.
If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized immediately in the results of operations. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period in which the change occurs.
F-41 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company, through certain of its foreign subsidiaries, has entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in Colombia and South Africa.

The interest rate swap agreement provides that the Company pay a fixed interest rate of 5.78% and receive variable interest at the one-month IBR over the term of the interest rate swap agreement. The notional value is reduced in accordance with the repayment schedule under the Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility.
Costa Rica As of December31, 2013, the Companys Costa Rican subsidiary has three interest rate swap agreements in Costa Rica, which mature on the earlier of termination of the underlying debt or February16, 2019.

For the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company reclassified $0.8 million, $0.8 million and $0.5 million (net of tax of $0.3 million in 2011), respectively, from OCI into Interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
The Company also recognized a gain on the settlement of interest rate swap agreements entered into in connection with the 2007 Securitization.The settlement was recognized as a reduction in interest expense over a five-year period for which the interest rate swaps were designated as hedges.During the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded $0.2 million and $0.4 million (net of tax of $0.2 million in 2011), respectively, as a reduction in interest expense. The remaining portion of the gain was fully amortized during the year ended December31, 2012.
In connection with the Companys conversion to a REIT, as of December31, 2011 the Company reversed the deferred tax assets and liabilities related to certain of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, approximately $1.8 million of deferred tax assets associated with the deferred loss on the settlement of the treasury rate lock and the deferred gain on the settlement of the interest rate swap agreement entered into in connection with the Securitization were reclassified to other comprehensive income.
For additional information on the Companys interest rate swap agreements, see notes 12 and 13.
12.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Below are the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
F-43 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The fair value of the Companys financial assets and liabilities that is required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis is as follows (in thousands): December31, 2013 FairValueMeasurementsUsing Assets/Liabilities at Fair Value Level1 Level2 Level3 Assets: Short-term investments(1) $ 18,612 $ 18,612 Interest rate swap agreements $ 90 $ 90 Liabilities: Acquisition-related contingent consideration $ 31,890 $ 31,890 Interest rate swap agreements $ 2,185 $ 2,185 December31, 2012 FairValueMeasurementsUsing Assets/Liabilities at Fair Value Level1 Level2 Level3 Assets: Short-term investments(1) $ 6,018 $ 6,018 Liabilities: Acquisition-related contingent consideration $ 23,711 $ 23,711 Interest rate swap agreements $ 5,442 $ 5,442 (1) Consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities in excess of three months.
Interest Rate Swap Agreements The fair value of the Companys interest rate swap agreements is determined using pricing models with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Fair valuations of the interest rate swap agreements reflect the value of the instrument including the values associated with counterparty risk, the Companys own credit standing and the value of the net credit differential between the counterparties to the derivative contract.
Acquisition-Related Contingent Consideration The Company may be required to pay additional consideration under certain agreements for the acquisition of communications sites if specific conditions are met or events occur. In Colombia and Ghana, the Company may be required to pay additional consideration upon theconversion of certain barter agreements with other wireless carriers to cash-paying lease agreements. In addition, as a result of the MIPT acquisition on October1, 2013, the Company assumed additional contingent consideration liability in Costa Rica, Panama and the United States. The Company may be required to pay additional consideration if certain pre-designated tenant leases commence during a limited specified period of time.
Acquisition-related contingent consideration is initially measured and recorded at fair value as an element of consideration paid in connection with an acquisition with subsequent adjustments recognized in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, and any subsequent changes in fair value using a discounted probability-weighted approach. This approach takes into consideration Level 3 unobservable inputs including probability assessments of expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled and applies a discount factor that captures the uncertainties associated with the obligation. Changes in these F-44 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS unobservable inputs could significantly impact the fair value of the liabilities recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
As of December31, 2013, the Company estimates the value of all potential acquisition-related contingent consideration required payments to be between zero and $50.1 million. During the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of the contingent consideration changed as follows (in thousands): 2013 2012 Balance as of January1 $ 23,711 $ 25,617 Additions (1) 13,474 6,653 Payments (8,789 ) (15,716 ) Change in fair value 5,743 6,329 Foreign currency translation adjustment (2,249 ) 828 Balance as of December31 $ 31,890 $ 23,711 (1) Approximately $9.3 million of the additions to contingent consideration liability relates to the MIPT acquisition.
Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The Companys long-lived assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs. During the year ended December31, 2013, certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $8,554.5 million were written down to their net realizable value of $8,538.6 million as a result of an asset impairment charge of $15.9 million. During the year ended December31, 2012, long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $5,379.2 million were written down to their net realizable value of $5,357.7 million, as a result of an asset impairment charge of $21.5 million. The asset impairment charges are recorded in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. These adjustments were determined by comparing the estimated proceeds from the sale of assets or the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the long-lived assets to the assets carrying value. There were no other items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December31, 2013.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments that reasonably approximate fair value at December31, 2013 and 2012 includes cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The Companys estimates of fair value of its long-term obligations, including the current portion, are based primarily upon reported market values. For long-term debt not actively traded, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis using rates for debt with similar terms and maturities. As of December31, 2013, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, are $14.5 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively, of which $8.6 billion is measured using Level 1 inputs and $6.1 billion is measured using Level 2 inputs. As of December31, 2012, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $8.8 billion and $9.4 billion, respectively, of which $4.9 billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $4.5 billion was measured using Level 2 inputs.

The tax effect of approximately $0.2 million is included in income tax expense for the year ended December31, 2013.
14.INCOME TAXES The Company has filed, for prior taxable years through its taxable year ended December31, 2011, a consolidated U.S. federal tax return, which included all of its then wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. For its taxable year commencing January1, 2012, the Company filed, and intends to continue to file, as a REIT, and its domestic TRSs filed, and intend to continue to file, as C corporations. The Company also files tax returns in various states and countries. The Companys state tax returns reflect different combinations of the Companys subsidiaries and are dependent on the connection each subsidiary has with a particular state. The following information pertains to the Companys income taxes on a consolidated basis.
The income tax provision from continuing operations is comprised of the following for the years ended December31, (in thousands): 2013 2012 2011 Current: Federal $ (30,322 ) $ (18,170 ) $ (14,069 ) State (13,731 ) (6,321 ) (19,346 ) Foreign (44,973 ) (53,513 ) (34,813 ) Deferred: Federal (16,318 ) (13,094 ) (81,685 ) State (5,139 ) (666 ) (12,001 ) Foreign 50,942 (15,540 ) 36,834 Income tax provision $ (59,541 ) $ (107,304 ) $ (125,080 ) F-46 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The income tax provision for the year ended December31, 2011 is net of the deferred tax benefit due to the Companys conversion to a REIT of approximately $121 million. The income tax provision for the year ended December31, 2013 includes an expense of approximately $21.5 million resulting from a restructuring of certain of the Companys domestic TRSs.
The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes and income on equity method investments are as follows for the years ended December31, (in thousands): 2013 2012 2011 United States $ 766,772 $ 787,960 $ 608,936 Foreign (225,023 ) (86,666 ) (102,041 ) Total $ 541,749 $ 701,294 $ 506,895 For the year ended December31, 2011, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $125.1 million, net of a benefit due to the adjustment of approximately $121 million in deferred tax liabilities (net of deferred tax assets) the values of which were reduced as a result of its conversion to a REIT. A reconciliation between the U.S. statutory rate and the effective rate from continuing operations is as follows for the years ended December31: 2013 2012 2011 Statutory tax rate 35 % 35 % 35 % Tax adjustment related to REIT (1) (35 ) (35 )  State taxes, net of federal benefit 3 1 6 Foreign taxes (5 ) 4 3 Foreign withholding taxes 6 4 2 Deferred tax adjustment due to REIT conversion   (24 ) Domestic TRS restructuring 4   Change in valuation allowance  8  Other 3 (2 ) 3 Effective tax rate 11 % 15 % 25 % (1) Includes 28% and 18% from dividend paid deductions in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
F-47 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The components of the net deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance are as follows as of December31, (in thousands): 2013 2012 Current assets: Allowances, accruals and other items not currently deductible $ 28,077 $ 31,561 Current deferred liabilities (4,547 ) (2,509 ) Subtotal 23,530 29,052 Valuation allowance (3,638 ) (3,298 ) Net current deferred tax assets $ 19,892 $ 25,754 Non-current items: Assets: Net operating loss carryforwards 197,335 127,914 Accrued asset retirement obligations 85,627 70,797 Stock-based compensation 4,331 25,258 Unearned revenue 46,788 21,912 Unrealized loss on foreign currency 68,951 33,010 Items not currently deductible and other 23,877 22,914 Liabilities: Depreciation and amortization (114,005 ) (42,896 ) Deferred rent (17,814 ) (18,640 ) Other (4,931 ) (4,566 ) Subtotal 290,159 235,703 Valuation allowance (132,368 ) (92,260 ) Net non-current deferred tax assets $ 157,791 $ 143,443 At December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of approximately $136.0 million and $95.6 million, respectively, which primarily relates to foreign items. During 2013, the Company increased amounts recorded as valuation allowances due to the uncertainty as to the timing of, and the Companys ability to recover, net deferred tax assets in certain foreign operations in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
The recoverability of the Companys net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on its current operations. Accordingly, the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on its current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that the net deferred tax asset will be realized.
The Companys deferred tax assets as of December31, 2012 in the table above do not include $6.9 million of excess tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options that are a component of NOLs as these benefits can only be recognized when the related tax deduction reduces income taxes payable. As of December31, 2013, the excess tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options have been fully recognized.
The Company considers the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. The Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the U.S. federal and state F-48 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $278.5 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the United States. Should the Company decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, it may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period it determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the United States.
At December31, 2013, the Company had net federal, state and foreign operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, which includes losses of approximately $0.3 billion related to employee stock options. If not utilized, the Companys net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows (in thousands): Years ended December31, Federal State Foreign 2014 to 2018 $  $ 109,577 $ 354 2019 to 2023  277,687 84,308 2024 to 2028 786,863 586,500  2029 to 2033 419,982 231,521  Indefinite carryforward   597,284 Total $ 1,206,845 $ 1,205,285 $ 681,946 In addition, the Company has Mexican tax credits of $2.4 million, which if not utilized will expire in 2017.
As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, is $31.1 million and $30.6 million, respectively. The Company expects the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. The impact of the amount of such changes to previously recorded uncertain tax positions could range from zero to $1.2 million. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows for the years ended December31, (in thousands): 2013 2012 2011 Balance at January1 $ 34,337 $ 38,886 $ 79,012 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 1,427 1,037 1,801 Additions for tax positions of prior years   16,520 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (320 ) (221 ) (54,430 ) Foreign currency (1,681 ) (439 ) (3,550 ) Reduction as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations and effective settlements (1,218 ) (4,926 ) (467 ) Balance at December31 $ 32,545 $ 34,337 $ 38,886 During the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, which resulted in a decrease of $1.2 million, $4.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in the liability for uncertain tax benefits, all of which reduced the income tax provision.
The Company recorded penalties and tax-related interest expense (benefit) to the tax provision of $3.4 million, ($2.9 million) and $9.1 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the total unrecognized tax benefits included in the consolidated balance sheets were $32.5 million and $34.3 million, respectively. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included the consolidated balance sheets were $30.9 million and $28.7 million, respectively.
F-49 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company has filed for prior taxable years, and for its taxable year ended December31, 2013 will file, numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns, including U.S. federal and state tax returns and foreign tax returns. The Company is subject to examination in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years. As a result of the Companys ability to carryforward federal, state and foreign NOLs, the applicable tax years generally remain open to examination several years after the applicable loss carryforwards have been used or expired. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December31, 2013.
In September 2013, the Internal Revenue Service released final Tangible Property Regulations (the Final Regulations). The Final Regulations provide guidance on applying Section263(a) of the Code to amounts paid to acquire, produce or improve tangible property, as well as rules for materials and supplies (Code Section162). These regulations contain certain changes from the temporary and proposed tangible property regulations that were issued on December27, 2011. The Final Regulations are generally effective for taxable years beginning on or after January1, 2014. In addition, taxpayers are permitted to early adopt the Final Regulations for taxable years beginning on or after January1, 2012. The Company does not expect the Final Regulations to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
15.STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $68.1 million, $52.0 million and $47.4 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December31, 2013 and 2011 included $1.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively, related to the modification of the vesting and exercise terms for certain employees equity awards. The Company did not modify the vesting or exercise terms of equity awards during the year ended December31, 2012. The Company capitalized $1.6 million and $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense as property and equipment during the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Summary of Stock-Based Compensation Plans The Company maintains equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of stock-based awards to its directors, officers and employees. The 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (2007 Plan) provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, as well as restricted stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. Exercise prices in the case of non-qualified and incentive stock options are not less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Equity awards typically vest ratably over various periods, generally four years, and stock options generally expire ten years from the date of grant. As of December31, 2013, the Company has the ability to grant stock-based awards with respect to an aggregate of 16.6million shares of common stock under the 2007 Plan.
Effective January1, 2013, the Companys Compensation Committee adopted a death, disability and retirement benefits program in connection with equity awards granted on or after January1, 2013 that provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employees death or permanent disability, or upon an employees qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, for grants made on or after January1, 2013, the Company recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation over the shorter of (i)the four-year vesting period or (ii)the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such retirement benefits, which may occur upon grant. Due to the accelerated recognition of stock-based compensation expense related to awards granted to retirement eligible employees, the Company recognized an additional $7.8 million of stock-based compensation expense during the year ended December31, 2013.
Stock Options The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the table below. The risk-free treasury rate is based F-50 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS on the U.S. Treasury yield approximating the estimated life in effect at the accounting measurement date. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) is estimated using the vesting term and historical exercise behavior of the Companys employees. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility for a period equal to the expected life of the stock options. The expected annual dividend is the Companys best estimate of expected future dividend yield.
Key assumptions used to apply this pricing model are as follows: 2013 2012 2011 Range of risk-free interest rate 0.75%-1.42% 0.62%1.03% 0.90%2.24% Weighted average risk-free interest rate 0.91% 0.92% 1.97% Expected life of option grants 4.41 years 4.40 years 4.50 years Range of expected volatility of underlying stock price 24.43%36.09% 36.53%37.86% 36.89%38.13% Weighted average expected volatility of underlying stock price 33.37% 37.84% 36.98% Expected annual dividend yield 1.50% 1.50% 0.03% The weighted average grant date fair value per share during the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $19.05, $17.46 and $17.18, respectively. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $42.1 million, $59.5 million and $54.6 million, respectively. As of December31, 2013, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options is approximately $34.4 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years. The amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was approximately $40.6 million during the year ended December31, 2013.

As of December31, 2013, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock units granted under the 2007 Plan is $76.9 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) for alleligible employees. Under the ESPP, shares of the Companys common stock may be purchased on the last day of each bi-annual offering period at a 15% discount of the lower of the closing market values on thefirst or last day of such offering period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period and may not purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock in a calendar year (based on market values at the beginning of each offering period). The offering periods run from June1 through November30 and from December1 through May31 of each year. During the 2013, 2012 and 2011 offering periods employee contributions were accumulated to purchase an estimated 78,000, 88,000 and 79,000 shares, respectively, at weighted average prices per share of $64.74, $51.59 and $44.56, respectively. During each six month offering period, employees accumulate payroll deductions to purchase the Companys common stock. The fair value of the ESPP shares purchased is estimated on the offering period commencement date using a Black-Scholes pricing model with the expense recognized over the expected life, which is the six month offering period. The weighted average fair value per share of ESPP shares purchased during the year ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $13.42, $13.64 and $12.18, respectively. At December31, 2013, 3.4million shares remain reserved for future issuance under the plan.

During the year ended December31, 2013, the Company repurchased 1,938,021 shares of its common stock for an aggregate of $145.0 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2011 Buyback. On September6, 2013, the Company temporarily suspended repurchases following the signing of its agreement to acquire MIPT. As of December31, 2013, the Company had repurchased a total of approximately 6.3million shares of its common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $389.0 million, including commissions and fees.
Under the 2011 Buyback, the Company is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, the Company makes purchases pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which allows the Company to repurchase shares during periods when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods.
The Company continues to manage the pacing of the remaining $1.1 billion under the 2011 Buyback in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors, including its financial policies. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases of its common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under its credit facilities. Purchases under the 2011 Buyback are subject to the Company having available cash to fund repurchases.

The following table sets forth basic and diluted income from continuing operations per common share computational data for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except per share data): 2013 2012 2011 Income from continuing operations attributable to American Tower Corporation $ 551,333 $ 637,283 $ 396,462 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 395,040 394,772 395,711 Dilutive securities 4,106 4,515 4,484 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 399,146 399,287 400,195 Basic income from continuing operations attributable to American Tower Corporation per common share $ 1.40 $ 1.61 $ 1.00 Diluted income from continuing operations attributable to American Tower Corporation per common share $ 1.38 $ 1.60 $ 0.99 F-54 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding excludes shares issuable upon exercise of the Companys stock options and stock based awards of 1.2million, 1.0million and 0.9million, respectively, as the effect would be anti-dilutive.
19.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of Company management, after consultation with counsel, other than the legal proceedings discussed below, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
TriStar Litigation The Company is involved in several lawsuits against TriStar Investors LLP and its affiliates (TriStar) in various states regarding single tower sites where TriStar has taken land interests under the Companys owned or managed sites and the Company believes TriStar has improperly induced the landowner to breach obligations to the Company.In addition, on February16, 2012, TriStar brought a federal action against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, in which TriStar principally alleges that the Company made misrepresentations to landowners when competing with TriStar for land under the Companys owned or managed sites.On January22, 2013, the Company filed an amended answer and counterclaim against TriStar and certain of its employees, denying Tristars claims and asserting that TriStar has engaged in a pattern of unlawful activity, including: (i)entering into agreements not to compete for land under certain towers; and (ii)making widespread misrepresentations to landowners regarding both TriStar and the Company.TriStar and the Company are each seeking injunctive relief that would prohibit the other party from making certain statements when interacting with landowners, as well as damages.
Lease Obligations The Company leases certain land, office and tower space under operating leases that expire over various terms. Many of the leases contain renewal options with specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal option. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to CPI or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the leases.
Future minimum rental payments under non-cancellable operating leases include payments for certain renewal periods at the Companys option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower sites and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that the Company will renew the leases. Such payments at December31, 2013 are as follows (in thousands): Year Ending December31, 2014 $ 512,429 2015 504,485 2016 492,058 2017 478,383 2018 466,138 Thereafter 4,433,263 Total $ 6,886,756 Aggregate rent expense (including the effect of straight-line rent expense) under operating leases for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 approximated $495.2 million, $419.0 million and $366.1 million, respectively.

In the United States, initial terms for television and radio broadcast leases typically range between ten to twenty years, while leases for wireless communications providers generally have initial terms of five to ten years. Internationally, the Companys typical tenant leases have initial terms of ten years. In most cases, the Companys tenant leases have multiple renewal terms at the option of the tenant.
Future minimum rental receipts expected from tenants under non-cancellable operating lease agreements in effect at December31, 2013 are as follows (in thousands): Year Ending December31, 2014 $ 3,109,078 2015 3,043,013 2016 2,966,499 2017 2,887,319 2018 2,735,520 Thereafter 7,901,662 Total $ 22,643,091 AT&T Transaction The Company has an agreement with SBC Communications Inc., a predecessor entity to AT&T Inc. (AT&T), for the lease or sublease of approximately 2,450 towers from AT&T commencing between December 2000 and August 2004. Substantially all of the towers are part of the Securitization. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 27 years, assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the sites subject to the applicable lease or sublease upon its expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2013 to 2032, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to that tower. The purchase price for each site is a fixed amount stated in the sublease for that site plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related tower by AT&T. During the year ended December31, 2013, the Company purchased four of the subleased towers upon expiration of the applicable agreement. The aggregate purchase option price for the remaining towers leased and subleased was approximately $597.9 million as of December31, 2013, and will accrete at a rate of 10%per year to the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site. For all such sites purchased by the Company prior to June30, 2020, AT&T will continue to lease the reserved space at the then-current monthly fee which shall escalate in accordance with the standard master lease agreement for the remainder of AT&Ts tenancy. Thereafter, AT&T shall have the right to renew such lease for up to four successive five-year terms. For all such sites purchased by the Company subsequent to F-56 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June30, 2020, AT&T has the right to continue to lease the reserved space for successive one-year terms at a rent equal to the lesser of the agreed upon market rate and the then current monthly fee, which is subject to an annual increase based on changes in the CPI.
Verizon Transaction In December 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with ALLTEL, a predecessor entity to Verizon Wireless (Verizon) to acquire towers through a 15-year sublease agreement. Pursuant to the agreement with Verizon, as amended, the Company acquired rights to a total of approximately 1,800 towers in tranches between April 2001 and March 2002. The Company has the option to purchase each tower at the expiration of the applicable sublease, which will occur in tranches between April 2016 and March 2017 based on the original closing date for such tranche of towers. The purchase price per tower as of the original closing date was $27,500 and will accrete at a rate of 3%per annum through the expiration of the applicable sublease. The aggregate purchase option price for the subleased towers is approximately $71.2 million as of December31, 2013. At Verizons option, at the expiration of the sublease, the purchase price would be payable in cash or with 769 shares of the Companys common stock per tower, which at December31, 2013 would be valued at approximately $109.0 million.
Guaranties and Indemnifications The Company enters into agreements from time to time in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which it agrees to guarantee or indemnify third parties for certain claims. The Company has also entered into purchase and sale agreements relating to the sale or acquisition of assets containing customary indemnification provisions. The Companys indemnification obligations under these agreements generally are limited solely to damages resulting from breaches of representations and warranties or covenants under the applicable agreements, but do not guaranty future performance. In addition, payments under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to whatever defenses the Company may have and are governed by dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular agreement. Further, the Companys obligations under these agreements may be limited in duration and/or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for payments made by the Company. The Company has not historically made any material payments under these agreements and, as of December31, 2013, is not aware of any agreements that could result in a material payment.
Other Contingencies The Company is subject to income tax and other taxes in the geographic areas where it operates, and periodically receives notifications of audits, assessments or other actions by taxing authorities.The Company evaluates the circumstances of each notification based on the information available, and records a liability for any potential outcome that is probable or more likely than not unfavorable, if the liability is also reasonably estimable. On January21, 2014, the Company received an income tax assessment in the amount of 22.6 billion INR (approximately $369.0 million on the date of assessment), asserting tax liabilities arising out of a transfer pricing review of transactions by Essar Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (ETIPL), and more specifically involving the issuance of share capital and the determination by the tax authority that an income tax obligation arose as a result of such issuance. The assessment was made with respect to transactions that took place in the tax year commencing in 2008, prior to the Companys acquisition of ETIPL. Under the Companys definitive acquisition agreement of ETIPL, the seller is obligated to indemnify and defend the Company with respect to any tax-related liability that may arise from activities prior to March31, 2010. The Company believes that there is no basis upon which the tax assessment can be enforced under existing tax law and accordingly has not recorded an obligation in the consolidated financial statements. The assessment is being challenged with the appellate authorities.

The Companys primary business is leasing antenna space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data and data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. This business is referred to as the Companys rental and management operations and is comprised of domestic and international segments:  Domestic: consisting of rental and management operations in the United States; and  International: consisting of rental and management operations in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Ghana, India, Mexico, Panama, Peru, South Africa and Uganda.
The Company has applied the aggregation criteria to operations within the international rental and management operating segments on a basis consistent with managements review of information and performance evaluation.
The Companys network development services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support its site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The network development services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from the rental and management operating segments and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies.
The accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. For reporting purposes, the international rental and management segment operating profit and segment gross margin also include Interest income, TV Azteca, net. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Loss on retirement of long-term obligations, Other (expense) income, Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling F-58 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS interest, Income (loss) on equity method investments, and Income tax provision (benefit). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Companys operating segments. All intercompany transactions are eliminated to reconcile segment results and assets to the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets.
Summarized financial information concerning the Companys reportable segments for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 is shown in the following tables. The Other column (i)represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as business development operations, stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense; Other operating expenses; Interest income; Interest expense; Loss on retirement of long-term obligations; and Other (expense) income, and (ii)reconciles segment operating profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes and income on equity method investments, as the amounts are not utilized in assessing each segments performance.
