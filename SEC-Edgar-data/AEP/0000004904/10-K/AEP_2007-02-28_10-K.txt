PART       I ITEM         1.
BUSINESS GENERAL OVERVIEW         AND DESCRIPTION OF SUBSIDIARIES AEP         was         incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1906 and reorganized         in         1925. It is a public utility holding company that owns, directly or indirectly,         all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and         varying percentages of other subsidiaries.
The         service areas of AEPs public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states         of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee,         Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. The generating and transmission facilities         of         AEPs public utility subsidiaries are interconnected and their operations are         coordinated. Transmission networks are interconnected with extensive         distribution facilities in the territories served. The public utility         subsidiaries of AEP have traditionally provided electric service, consisting         of         generation, transmission and distribution, on an integrated basis to their         retail customers. Restructuring legislation in Michigan, Ohio, Texas and         Virginia has caused AEP public utility subsidiaries in those states to unbundle         previously integrated regulated rates for their retail customers.
The         AEP         System is an integrated electric utility system and, as a result, the member         companies of the AEP System have contractual, financial and other business         relationships with the other member companies, such as participation in the         AEP         System savings and retirement plans and tax returns, sales of electricity         and         transportation and handling of fuel. The member companies of the AEP System         also         obtain certain accounting, administrative, information systems, engineering,         financial, legal, maintenance and other services at cost from a common provider,         AEPSC.
At         December 31, 2005, the subsidiaries of AEP had a total of 19,630 employees.         Because it is a holding company rather than an operating company, AEP has         no         employees. The public utility subsidiaries of AEP are: APCo (organized         in Virginia in 1926) is engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution         of electric power to approximately 942,000 retail customers in the southwestern         portion of Virginia and southern West Virginia, and in supplying and marketing         electric power at wholesale to other electric utility companies, municipalities         and other market participants. At December 31, 2005, APCo and its wholly         owned         subsidiaries had 2,408 employees. Among the principal industries served by         APCo         are coal mining, primary metals, chemicals and textile mill products. In         addition to its AEP System interconnections, APCo also is interconnected         with         the following unaffiliated utility companies: Carolina Power & Light         Company, Duke Energy Corporation and Virginia Electric and Power Company.         APCo         has several points of interconnection with TVA and has entered into agreements         with TVA under which APCo and TVA interchange and transfer electric power         over         portions of their respective systems. APCo is a member of PJM.
CSPCo (organized         in Ohio in 1937, the earliest direct predecessor company having been organized         in 1883) is engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric         power to approximately 710,000 retail customers in Ohio, and in supplying         and         marketing electric power at wholesale to other electric utilities,         municipalities and other market participants. At December 31, 2005, CSPCo         had         1,178 employees. CSPCos service area is comprised of two areas in Ohio, which         include portions of twenty-five counties. One area includes the City of Columbus         and the other is a predominantly rural area in south central Ohio. Among         the         principal industries served are food processing, chemicals, primary metals,         electronic machinery and paper products. In addition to its AEP System         interconnections, CSPCo also is interconnected with the following unaffiliated         utility companies: CG&E, DP&L and Ohio Edison Company. CSPCo is a member         of PJM. Pursuant to an acquisition that closed on December 31, 2005, CSPCo         purchased the electric utility operations of Monongahela Power Company in         Ohio.         As a result, in January 2006 approximately 29,000 customers in six southeastern         Ohio counties, together with the transmission and distribution used to serve         such customers, were added to CSPCos service territory.
I&M (organized         in Indiana in 1925) is engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution         of electric power to approximately 581,000 retail customers in northern and         eastern Indiana and southwestern Michigan, and in supplying and marketing         electric power at wholesale to other electric utility companies, rural electric         cooperatives, municipalities and other market participants. At December 31,         2005, I&M had 2,633 employees. Among the principal industries served are         primary metals, transportation equipment, electrical and electronic machinery,         fabricated metal products, rubber and miscellaneous plastic products and         chemicals and allied products. Since 1975, I&M has leased and operated the         assets of the municipal system of the City of Fort Wayne, Indiana. In addition         to its AEP System interconnections, I&M also is interconnected with the         following unaffiliated utility companies: Central Illinois Public Service         Company, CG&E, Commonwealth Edison Company, Consumers Energy Company,         Illinois Power Company, Indianapolis Power & Light Company, Louisville Gas         and Electric Company, Northern Indiana Public Service Company, PSI Energy         Inc.         and Richmond Power & Light Company. I&M is a member of PJM.
KPCo (organized         in Kentucky in 1919) is engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution         of electric power to approximately 176,000 retail customers in an area in         eastern Kentucky, and in supplying and marketing electric power at wholesale         to         other electric utility companies, municipalities and other market participants.         At December 31, 2005, KPCo had 454 employees. In addition to its AEP System         interconnections, KPCo also is interconnected with the following unaffiliated         utility companies: Kentucky Utilities Company and East Kentucky Power         Cooperative Inc.

EPACT       AND THE       REPEAL OF PUHCA EPACT       was       signed into law on August 8, 2005. Among other things, EPACT repealed PUHCA,       effective February 8, 2006. PUHCA regulated many significant aspects of a       registered holding company system, such as the AEP System. PUHCA limited the       operations of a registered holding company system to a single integrated public       utility system and such other businesses as were incidental or necessary to       the       operations of the system. PUHCA also required that transactions between       associated companies in a registered holding company system be performed at       cost, with limited exceptions. As a result of PUHCAs repeal, utility holding       companies, including the AEP system, are no longer limited to a single       integrated public utility system. Further, utility holding companies are no       longer restricted from acquiring businesses that may not be related to the       utility business. Jurisdiction over certain holding company related activities       has been transferred to the FERC. Specifically, the FERC has jurisdiction over       the issuances of securities of our public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition       of securities of utilities, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets,       and mergers with another electric utility or holding company. In addition,       both       FERC and state regulators will be permitted to review the books and records       of       any company within a holding company system.
EPACT       contains key provisions affecting the electric power industry. These provisions       include tax changes for the utility industry, incentives for emissions       reductions and federal insurance and incentives to build new nuclear power       plants. It gives the FERC backstop transmission siting authority as well as       increased utility merger oversight. The law also provides incentives and funding       for clean coal technologies and initiatives to voluntarily reduce greenhouse       gases. The law required the FERC to issue certain regulations implementing       EPACT       within 120 days of enactment. We have reviewed the proposed rules and are       participating in the public comment process. However, we cannot currently       predict what impact the final rules will have on our financial condition and       results of operations.
AEP-CSW       MERGER On       June       15, 2000, a wholly owned merger subsidiary of AEP merged with and into CSW       (now       known as AEP Utilities, Inc.). As a result, CSW became a wholly owned subsidiary       of AEP. The four wholly owned public utility subsidiaries of CSW - PSO, SWEPCo,       TCC and TNC - became indirect wholly owned public utility subsidiaries of AEP       as       a result of the merger. The merger was approved by the FERC and the       SEC.
On       January 18, 2002, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled       that the SEC failed to properly explain how the merger met the requirements       of       PUHCA and remanded the case to the SEC for further review. Upon PUHCAs repeal       in February 2006, we received a letter from the SEC which formally dismissed       the       proceeding challenging our merger.
FINANCING General Companies       within the AEP System generally use short-term debt to finance working capital       needs. Short-term debt is also used to finance acquisitions, construction and       redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be       financed with long-term debt. In recent history, short-term funding needs have       been provided for by cash on hand and AEPs commercial paper program. Funds are       made available to subsidiaries under the AEP corporate borrowing program.       Certain public utility subsidiaries of AEP also sell accounts receivable to       provide liquidity.
AEPs       revolving credit agreements (which backstop the commercial paper program)       include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility,       including a maximum debt/capital test and a $50 million cross-acceleration       provision. At December 31, 2005, AEP was in compliance with its debt covenants.       With the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency, any event of default       has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of       the       agreements. A voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency would be considered an       immediate termination event. See Managements       Financial Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations ,       included in the 2005 Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Financial       Condition for       additional information with respect to AEPs credit agreements.
AEPs       subsidiaries have also utilized, and expect to continue to utilize, additional       financing arrangements, such as leasing arrangements, including the leasing       of       utility assets and coal mining and transportation equipment and       facilities.
Credit       Ratings In       September 2005, Moodys upgraded AEPs senior unsecured rating to Baa2 from Baa3       and its commercial paper rating to Prime-2 from Prime-3. There were no changes       in the ratings or rating outlook for AEPs rated subsidiaries in 2005. S&P       and Fitch did not change the ratings of AEP or its rated subsidiaries during       2005.

ENVIRONMENTAL       AND OTHER MATTERS General AEPs       subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal, state and local       authorities with regard to air and water-quality control and other environmental       matters, and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities.       The environmental issues that are potentially material to the AEP system       include:  The                 CAA and CAAA and state laws and regulations (including State                 Implementation Plans) that require compliance, obtaining permits                 and                 reporting as to air emissions. See Managements                 Financial Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations under                 the headings entitled Environmental                 Matters - Clean                 Air Act Requirements and Estimated                 Air Quality Environmental Investments .
Litigation                 with the federal and certain state governments and certain special                 interest groups regarding whether modifications to or maintenance                 of                 certain coal-fired generating plants required additional permitting                 or                 pollution control technology, and/or whether emissions from coal-fired                 generating plants cause or contribute to global climate changes.                 See Managements                 Financial Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations under                 the heading entitled Environmental                 Matters - Environmental                 Litigation and                 Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements entitled Commitments                 and Contingencies ,                 included in the 2005 Annual Reports, for further                 information.
Rules                 issued by the EPA and certain states that require substantial reductions                 in SO 2 ,                 mercury and NOx emissions, some of which became effective in 2005.                 The                 remaining compliance dates and proposals would take effect periodically                 through as late as 2018. AEP is installing (and has installed) emission                 control technology and is taking other measures to comply with required                 reductions. See Managements                 Financial Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations under                 the headings entitled Environmental                 Matters - Clean Air Act Requirements and Estimated                 Air Quality Environmental Investments included                 in the 2005 Annual Reports for further                 information.

AEP does not, however, anticipate                 that                 any of its currently identified CERCLA-related issues will result                 in                 material costs or penalties to the AEP System.

In                 July 2004, the EPA adopted a new Clean Water Act rule to reduce the                 number                 of fish and other aquatic organisms killed at once-through cooled                 power                 plants.

The majority of solid waste created from                 the                 combustion of coal and fossil fuels is fly ash and other coal combustion                 byproducts, which the EPA has determined are not hazardous waste                 subject                 to RCRA.
In       addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and       regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance,       including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions.

If       our       expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation and       associated operating costs are not recoverable from customers through regulated       rates (in regulated jurisdictions) or market prices (in deregulated       jurisdictions), those costs could adversely affect future results of operations       and cash flows, and possibly financial condition.
The       cost       of complying with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules is       expected to be material to the AEP System.
See Managements       Financial Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations under       the       heading entitled Environmental       Matters and       Note       7 to the consolidated financial statements entitled Commitments       and Contingencies, included       in the 2005 Annual Reports, for further information with respect to       environmental matters.
Environmental       Investments Investments       related to improving AEP System plants environmental performance and compliance       with air and water quality standards during 2004 and 2005 and the current       estimates for 2006, 2007 and 2008 are shown below, in each case excluding AFUDC.       Substantial investments in addition to the amounts set forth below are expected       by the System in future years in connection with the modification and addition       of facilities at generating plants for environmental quality controls in order       to comply with air and water quality standards which have been or may be       adopted. Future investments could be significantly greater if litigation       regarding whether AEP properly installed emission control equipment on its       plants is resolved against any AEP subsidiaries or emissions reduction       requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous. See Managements       Financial Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations under       the       heading entitled Environmental       Matters and Note       7 to       the consolidated financial statements, entitled Commitments       and Contingencies, included       in the 2005 Annual Reports, for more information regarding this litigation       and       environmental expenditures in general.

Electric fields are created by the       presence of electric charges. Magnetic fields are produced by the flow of those       charges. This means that EMF are created by electricity flowing in transmission       and distribution lines, electrical equipment, household wiring, and       appliances.
A       number       of studies in the past several years have examined the possibility of adverse       health effects from EMF. While some of the epidemiological studies have       indicated some association between exposure to EMF and health effects, none       has       produced any conclusive evidence that EMF does or does not cause adverse health       effects.
Management       cannot predict the ultimate impact of the question of EMF exposure and adverse       health effects. If further research shows that EMF exposure contributes to       increased risk of cancer or other health problems, or if the courts conclude       that EMF exposure harms individuals and that utilities are liable for damages,       or if states limit the strength of magnetic fields to such a level that the       current electricity delivery system must be significantly changed, then the       results of operations and financial condition of AEP and its operating       subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected unless these costs can       be       recovered from customers.
UTILITY       OPERATIONS GENERAL Utility       operations constitute most of AEPs business operations. Utility operations       include (i) the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power       to       retail customers and (ii) the supplying and marketing of electric power at       wholesale (through the electric generation function) to other electric utility       companies, municipalities and other market participants. AEPSC, as agent for       AEPs public utility subsidiaries, performs marketing, generation dispatch, fuel       procurement and power-related risk management and trading       activities.
ELECTRIC       GENERATION Facilities AEPs       public utility subsidiaries own or lease approximately 35,000 MW of domestic       generation. See Item       2  Properties for       more       information regarding AEPs generation capacity.
AEP       Power Pool and CSW Operating Agreement APCo,       CSPCo, I&M, KPCo and OPCo are parties to the Interconnection Agreement,       dated July 6, 1951, as amended (Interconnection Agreement), defining how they       share the costs and benefits associated with their generating plants. This       sharing is based upon each companys member-load-ratio. The Interconnection       Agreement has been approved by the FERC.
The       member-load-ratio is calculated monthly by dividing such companys highest       monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest       monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all east zone public utility       subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2005, the member-load-ratios were as       follows: Peak Demand (MW) Member-Load Ratio                 (%) APCo 7,080 31.2 CSPCo 4,105 18.1 I&M 4,193 18.5 KPCo 1,685 7.4 OPCo 5,638 24.8 The       Ohio       Act was enacted in 2001. To comply with that law CSPCo and OPCo functionally       separated their generation business from their remaining operations. They plan       to remain functionally separated through at least December 31, 2008 as       authorized by their rate stabilization plan approved by the PUCO. See Managements       Financial Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations, under       the heading entitled Ohio       Regulatory Activity included       in the 2005 Annual Reports under the heading entitled Significant       Factors and       Note       6 to the consolidated financial statements, entitled Customer       Choice and Industry Restructuring ,       included in the 2005 Annual Reports, for more information.
Since       1995, APCo, CSPCo, I&M, KPCo and OPCo have been parties to the AEP System       Interim Allowance Agreement (Allowance Agreement), which provides, among other       things, for the transfer of emission allowances associated with transactions       under the Interconnection Agreement. The following table shows the net (credits)       or charges allocated among the parties under the Interconnection Agreement       and       the Allowance Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and       2005: 2003 2004 2005 (in                 thousands) APCo $ 218,000 $ 239,400 $ 288,000 CSPCo 276,800 284,900 285,600 I&M (118,800 ) (141,500 ) (197,400 ) KPCo 38,400 31,600 42,200 OPCo (414,400 ) (414,400 ) (418,400 ) PSO,       SWEPCo, TCC, TNC, and AEPSC are parties to a Restated and Amended Operating       Agreement originally dated as of January 1, 1997 (CSW Operating Agreement),       which has been approved by the FERC. The CSW Operating Agreement requires the       west zone public utility subsidiaries to maintain adequate annual planning       reserve margins and requires the subsidiaries that have capacity in excess       of       the required margins to make such capacity available for sale to other AEP       west       zone public utility subsidiaries as capacity commitments. Parties are       compensated for energy delivered to recipients based upon the deliverers       incremental cost plus a portion of the recipients savings realized by the       purchaser that avoids the use of more costly alternatives. Revenues and costs       arising from third party sales in their region are generally shared based on       the       amount of energy each west zone public utility subsidiary contributes that       is       sold to third parties. The separation of the generation business undertaken       by       TCC and TNC to comply with the Texas Act has made the business operations of       TCC       and TNC incompatible with the CSW Operating Agreement. We have applied with       the       FERC to remove these two companies from the CSW Operating Agreement. Upon       approval (or earlier for TCC, if the sale of its interest in the Oklaunion       plant       occurs first), these companies will no longer supply generating capacity under       the CSW Operating Agreement.
The       following table shows the net (credits) or charges allocated among the parties       under the CSW Operating Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2003,       2004       and 2005: 2003 2004 2005 (in                 thousands) PSO $ 44,000 $ 55,000 $ 27,600 SWEPCo (46,600 ) (59,800 ) (27,500 ) TCC (29,500 ) 1,100 0 TNC 32,100 3,700 (100 ) Power       generated by or allocated or provided under the Interconnection Agreement or       CSW       Operating Agreement to any public utility subsidiary is primarily sold to       customers (or in the case of the ERCOT area of Texas, to REPs) by such public       utility subsidiary at rates approved (other than in the ERCOT area of Texas)       by       the public utility commission in the jurisdiction of sale. In Ohio and Virginia,       such rates are based on a statutory formula as those jurisdictions continue       to       transition to the use of market rates for generation. See Regulation        Rates under Item       1, Utility Operations .
Under       both the Interconnection Agreement and CSW Operating Agreement, power that       is       not needed to serve the native load of our public utility subsidiaries is sold       in the wholesale market by AEPSC on behalf of those subsidiaries. See Risk       Management and Trading ,       below , for       a       discussion of the trading and marketing of such power.
AEPs       System Integration Agreement, which has been approved by the FERC, provides       for       the integration and coordination of AEPs east and west zone operating       subsidiaries. This includes joint dispatch of generation within the AEP System       and the distribution, between the two zones, of costs and benefits associated       with the transfers of power between the two zones (including sales to third       parties and risk management and trading activities). It is designed to function       as an umbrella agreement in addition to the Interconnection Agreement and the       CSW Operating Agreement, each of which controls the distribution of costs and       benefits for activities within each zone. The separation of the generation       business undertaken by TCC and TNC to comply with the Texas Act has made the       business operations of TCC and TNC incompatible with the System Integration       Agreement. As a result, we have applied with the FERC to remove these two       companies from this agreement.
Risk       Management and Trading As       agent       for AEPs public utility subsidiaries, AEPSC sells excess power into the market       and engages in power, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances risk management       and trading activities focused in regions in which AEP traditionally operates.       These activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity (and       to       a lesser extent, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances) under physical       forward contracts at fixed and variable prices. These contracts include physical       transactions, over-the-counter swaps and exchange-traded futures and options.       The majority of physical forward contracts are typically settled by entering       into offsetting contracts.
These       transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges.       Counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to       be       deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions. As of December       31, 2005, counterparties and exchanges have posted approximately $324 million       in       cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEPSC for the benefit of AEPs       public utility subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEPs public utility       subsidiaries had posted approximately $127 million with counterparties and       exchanges). Since open trading contracts are valued based on changes in market       power prices, exposures change daily.
Fuel       Supply The       following table shows the sources of power generated by the AEP       System: 2003 2004 2005 Coal                 and Lignite 80% 83% 83% Natural                 Gas 7% 5% 6% Nuclear 9% 12% 10% Hydroelectric                 and other 4% 1% 1% Variations       in the generation of nuclear power are primarily related to refueling and       maintenance outages and to the sale of TCCs share of STP in May 2005.       Variations in the generation of natural gas power are primarily related to       the       availability of cheaper alternatives to fulfill certain power requirements       and       the deactivation or sale of certain gas-fired plants owned by TCC and TNC.       Price       increases in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels generally result       in increased use of other fuels.
Coal       and Lignite : AEPs       public utility subsidiaries procure coal and lignite under a combination of       purchasing arrangements including long-term contracts, affiliate operations,       short-term, and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms.       The price for coal fuels increased in 2005 and we expect that this trend may       continue. Management has responded to increases in the price of coal by       rebalancing the coal used in its generating facilities with products from       different coal regions and sources of differing heat and sulfur contents. This       rebalancing is an ongoing process that is expected to continue. Management       believes, but cannot provide assurances, that AEPs public utility subsidiaries       will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and       in       adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignite-fired units. See Item       1 - Investments-Other for a       discussion of AEPs coal marketing and transportation operations.
The       following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the AEP System       during the past three years and the average delivered price of spot coal       purchased by System companies: 2003 2004 2005 Total                 coal delivered to AEP operated plants (thousands of tons) 76,042 71,778 75,063 Average                 price per ton of spot-purchased coal $28.91 $33.83 $43.75 The       coal       supplies at AEP System plants vary from time to time depending on various       factors, including customers usage of electric power, space limitations, the       rate of consumption at particular plants, labor issues and weather conditions       that may interrupt deliveries. At December 31, 2005, the Systems coal inventory       was approximately 30 days of normal usage.
In       cases       of emergency or shortage, system companies have developed programs to conserve       coal supplies at their plants. Such programs have been filed and reviewed with       officials of federal and state agencies and, in some cases, the relevant state       regulatory agency has prescribed actions to be taken under specified       circumstances by System companies, subject to the jurisdiction of such       agency.
The       FERC       has adopted regulations relating, among other things, to the circumstances       under       which, in the event of fuel emergencies or shortages, it might order electric       utilities to generate and transmit electric power to other regions or systems       experiencing fuel shortages, and to ratemaking principles by which such electric       utilities would be compensated. In addition, the federal government is       authorized, under prescribed conditions, to reallocate coal and to require       the       transportation thereof, for the use at power plants or major fuel-burning       installations experiencing fuel shortages.
Natural       Gas : Through       its public utility subsidiaries, AEP consumed over       109       billion cubic       feet of natural gas during 2005 for generating power. A majority of the natural       gas-fired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines, which allows       greater access to competitive supplies and improves delivery reliability. A       portfolio of long-term, monthly and seasonal firm purchase and transportation       agreements (that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market       prices) supplies natural gas requirements for each plant.
Nuclear: I&M       has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the Cook       Plant. Steps currently are being taken, based upon the planned fuel cycles       for       the Cook Plant, to review, evaluate and fulfill I&Ms requirements for the       supply of nuclear fuel. I&M has made and will make purchases of uranium in       various forms in the spot, short-term, and mid-term markets until it decides       that deliveries under long-term supply contracts are warranted.
For       purposes of the storage of high-level radioactive waste in the form of spent       nuclear fuel, I&M completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage       pool more than 10 years ago. I&M anticipates that the Cook Plant has       sufficient storage capacity for its spent nuclear fuel to permit normal       operations through 2013. I&M has initiated a project to study the use of dry       cask storage.
Nuclear       Waste and Decommissioning As       the       owner of the Cook Plant, I&M has a significant future financial commitment       to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant       safely. The ultimate cost of retiring the Cook Plant may be materially different       from estimates and funding targets as a result of the:  Type                 of decommissioning plan selected;  Escalation                 of various cost elements (including, but not limited to, general                 inflation);  Further                 development of regulatory requirements governing                 decommissioning;  Limited                 availability to date of significant experience in decommissioning                 such                 facilities;  Technology                 available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly                 from that                 assumed in studies;  Availability                 of nuclear waste disposal facilities;                 and  Availability                 of a DOE facility for permanent storage of spent nuclear                 fuel.
Accordingly,       management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of       decommissioning the Cook Plant will not be significantly different than current       projections.
See       Note       7 to the consolidated financial statements, entitled Commitments       and Contingencies ,       included in the 2005 Annual Reports, for information with respect to nuclear       waste and decommissioning and related litigation.
Low-Level       Radioactive Waste : The       LLWPA       mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive       waste       rests with the individual states. Low-level radioactive waste consists largely       of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive       materials. Michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste       available. I&M cannot predict when such a site may be available, but South       Carolina and Utah operate low-level radioactive waste disposal sites and       currently accept low-level radioactive waste from Michigan. I&Ms access to       the South Carolina facility is currently allowed through the end of fiscal       year       2008. There is currently no set date limiting I&Ms access to the Utah       facility.
Structured       Arrangements Involving Capacity, Energy, and Ancillary       Services In       January 2000, OPCo and NPC, an affiliate of Buckeye, entered into an agreement       relating to the construction and operation of a 510 MW gas-fired electric       generating peaking facility to be owned by NPC and called the Mone Plant. OPCo       is entitled to 100% of the power generated by the Mone Plant, and is responsible       for the fuel and other costs of the facility through May 2006. Following that,       NPC and OPCo will be entitled to 80% and 20%, respectively, of the power of       the       Mone Plant, and both parties will generally be responsible for their allocable       portion of the fuel and other costs of the facility.
Certain       Power Agreements AEGCo : Since       its       formation in 1982, AEGCos business has consisted of the ownership and financing       of its 50% interest in Unit 1 of the Rockport Plant and, since 1989, leasing       of       its 50% interest in Unit 2 of the Rockport Plant. The operating revenues of       AEGCo are derived from the sale of capacity and energy associated with its       interest in the Rockport Plant to I&M and KPCo pursuant to unit power       agreements, which have been approved by the FERC.
The       I&M Power Agreement provides for the sale by AEGCo to I&M of all the       capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the       Rockport Plant. Whether or not power is available from AEGCo, I&M is       obligated to pay as a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and       as       an energy charge for any associated energy taken by I&M). When added to       amounts received by AEGCo from any other sources, such amounts will be at least       sufficient to enable AEGCo to pay all its operating and other expenses,       including a rate of return on the common equity of AEGCo as approved by FERC,       currently 12.16%. The I&M Power Agreement will continue in effect until the       last of the lease terms of Unit 2 of the Rockport Plant has expired (currently       December 2022) unless extended in specified circumstances.
Pursuant       to an assignment between I&M and KPCo, and a unit power agreement between       KPCo and AEGCo, AEGCo sells KPCo 30% of the capacity (and the energy associated       therewith) available to AEGCo from both units of the Rockport Plant. KPCo has       agreed to pay to AEGCo the amounts which I&M would have paid AEGCo under the       terms of the I&M Power Agreement for such entitlement. The KPCo unit power       agreement expires in December 2022.
AEGCo       and       AEP have entered into a capital funds agreement pursuant to which, among other       things, AEP has unconditionally agreed to make cash capital contributions,       or in       certain circumstances subordinated loans, to AEGCo to the extent necessary       to       enable AEGCo to (i) maintain such an equity component of capitalization as       required by governmental regulatory authorities; (ii) provide its proportionate       share of the funds required to permit commercial operation of the Rockport       Plant; (iii) enable AEGCo to perform all of its obligations, covenants and       agreements under, among other things, all loan agreements, leases and related       documents to which AEGCo is or becomes a party (AEGCo Agreements); and (iv)       pay       all indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of AEGCo (AEGCo Obligations)       under       the AEGCo Agreements, other than indebtedness, obligations or liabilities owing       to AEP. The capital funds agreement will terminate after all AEGCo obligations       have been paid in full.
OVEC: AEP,       CSPCo and several unaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC. In April       2004, AEP agreed to sell a portion of its shares in OVEC (.73% of OVEC) to       Louisville Gas and Electric Company. The sale was completed in the first quarter       of 2005. As a result of the sale, the aggregate equity participation of AEP       and       CSPCo in OVEC decreased from 44.2% to 43.47%. Until September 1, 2001, OVEC       supplied from its generating capacity the power requirements of a uranium       enrichment plant near Portsmouth, Ohio owned by the DOE. The sponsoring       companies are now entitled to receive and obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity       (approximately 2,200 MW) in proportion to their power participation ratios.       The       aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, CSPCo, I&M and OPCo is 42.1%.       The proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC are designed to be sufficient for       OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return       on       its equity capital. The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA), which defines       the       rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each, will expire       by its terms on March 12, 2006. An Amended and Restated ICPA has been       unanimously approved and executed by the sponsoring companies and OVEC. The       amended agreement, filed with and accepted by FERC, extends the term of the       ICPA       for an additional 20 years to March 13, 2026. The aggregate power participation       ratio of the AEP entities in the Amended and Restated ICPA is 43.47%. The       AEP-affiliated owners of OVEC and the other owners are evaluating the need       for       environmental investments related to their ownership interests, which may be       material.
Buckeye: On       October 1, 2004, AEP joined PJM, and the Buckeye transmission service over       the       AEP System was transferred under the PJM OATT. Buckeye is entitled under the       Cardinal Station Agreement to receive, and is obligated to pay for, the excess       of its maximum one-hour coincident peak demand plus a 15% reserve margin over       the 1,226,500 kilowatts of capacity of the generating units which Buckeye       currently owns in the Cardinal Station. Such demand, which occurred on July       25,       2005, was recorded at 1,434,807 kilowatts.
ELECTRIC       TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION General AEPs       public utility subsidiaries (other than AEGCo) own and operate transmission       and       distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power. See Item       2Properties for       more       information regarding the transmission and distribution lines. Most of the       transmission and distribution services are sold, in combination with electric       power, to retail customers of AEPs public utility subsidiaries in their service       territories. These sales are made at rates established and approved by the       state       utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances,       approved by the FERC. See RegulationRates .       The       FERC regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions.       See Item       1 - Business/Utility Operations - RegulationFERC .       As       discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to       non-affiliated companies.
AEPs       public utility subsidiaries (other than AEGCo) hold franchises or other rights       to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their       service areas. In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the       exclusive right to provide electric service. These franchises have varying       provisions and expiration dates. In general, the operating companies consider       their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business. For a       discussion of competition in the sale of power, see Item       1 - Business/Utility Operations - Competition .
AEP       Transmission Pool Transmission       Equalization Agreement: APCo,       CSPCo, I&M, KPCo and OPCo operate their transmission lines as a single       interconnected and coordinated system and are parties to the Transmission       Equalization Agreement, dated April 1, 1984, as amended (TEA), defining how       they       share the costs and benefits associated with their relative ownership of the       extra-high-voltage transmission system (facilities rated 345kV and above) and       certain facilities operated at lower voltages (138kV up to 345kV). The TEA       has       been approved by the FERC. Sharing under the TEA is based upon each companys member-load-ratio. The member-load-ratio is calculated monthly by dividing       such companys highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the       aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for       all       east zone operating companies. As of December 31, 2005, the member-load-ratios       were as follows: Peak                 Demand (MW) Member-Load Ratio                 (%) APCo 7,080 31.2 CSPCo 4,105 18.1 I&M 4,193 18.5 KPCo 1,685 7.4 OPCo 5,638 24.8 The       following table shows the net (credits) or charges allocated among the parties       to the TEA during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005: 2003 2004 2005 (in                 thousands) APCo $ 0 $ (500 ) $ 8,900 CSPCo 38,200 37,700 34,600 I&M (39,800 ) (40,800 ) (47,000 ) KPCo (5,600 ) (6,100 ) (3,500 ) OPCo 7,200 9,700 7,000 Transmission       Coordination Agreement: PSO,       SWEPCo, TCC, TNC and AEPSC are parties to the TCA. The TCA has been approved       by       the FERC and establishes a coordinating committee, which is charged with the       responsibility of overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission       facilities of the west zone public utility subsidiaries, including the       performance of transmission planning studies, the interaction of such       subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies       interested in transmission planning and compliance with the terms of the OATT       filed with the FERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such       tariff.
Under       the       TCA, the west zone public utility subsidiaries have delegated to AEPSC the       responsibility of monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems       and       administering the AEP OATT on their behalf. The TCA also provides for the       allocation among the west zone public utility subsidiaries of revenues collected       for transmission and ancillary services provided under the AEP       OATT.
The       following table shows the net (credits) or charges allocated among the parties       to the TCA during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005: 2003 2004 2005 (in                 thousands) PSO $ 4,200 $ 8,100 $ 3,500 SWEPCo 5,000 13,800 5,200 TCC (3,600 ) (12,200 ) (3,800 ) TNC (5,600 ) (9,700 ) (4,900 ) Transmission       Services for Non-Affiliates: In       addition to providing transmission services in connection with their own power       sales, AEPs public utility subsidiaries through RTOs also provide transmission       services for non-affiliated companies. See Item       1 - Business/Utility operations - Regional Transmission Organizations, below .
Transmission       of electric power by AEPs public utility subsidiaries is regulated by the FERC.
Coordination       of East and West Zone Transmission: AEPs       System Transmission Integration Agreement provides for the integration and       coordination of the planning, operation and maintenance of the transmission       facilities of AEPs east and west zone public utility subsidiaries. The System       Transmission Integration Agreement functions as an umbrella agreement in       addition to the TEA and the TCA. The System Transmission Integration Agreement       contains two service schedules that govern:  The                 allocation of transmission costs and revenues and  The                 allocation of third-party transmission costs and revenues and System                 dispatch costs.
The       System Transmission Integration Agreement contemplates that additional service       schedules may be added as circumstances warrant.
Regional       Transmission Organizations On       April       24, 1996, the FERC issued orders 888 and 889. These orders require each public       utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to file an       open       access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services       comparable to the utilitys own uses of its transmission system. The orders also       require utilities to functionally unbundle their services, by requiring them       to       use their own tariffs in making off-system and third-party sales. As part of       the       orders, the FERC issued a pro-forma tariff       that reflects the Commissions views on the minimum non-price terms and       conditions for non-discriminatory transmission service. In addition, the orders       require all transmitting utilities to establish an OASIS, which electronically       posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and       require utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities system operators from providing non-public transmission information to the       utilitys merchant energy employees. The orders also allow a utility to seek       recovery of certain prudently incurred stranded costs that result from unbundled       transmission service.
In       December 1999, FERC issued Order 2000, which provides for the voluntary       formation of RTOs, entities created to operate, plan and control utility       transmission assets. Order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and       functions of acceptable RTO proposals. As a condition of FERCs approval in 2000       of AEPs merger with CSW, AEP was required to transfer functional control of its       transmission facilities to one or more RTOs. The AEP East Companies integrated       into PJM (a FERC-approved RTO) on October 1, 2004.
SWEPCo       and PSO are members of the SPP. In February 2004, the FERC conditionally       approved SPP as an RTO. In October 2004, the FERC issued an order granting       RTO       status to SPP subject to certain filings. The Arkansas Public Service Commission       and LPSC are       concerned about the effect on retail ratepayers of utilities in Louisiana and       Arkansas joining RTOs. These commissions have ordered the utilities in those       states, including our utilities, to analyze and submit to them the costs and       benefits of RTO options available to the utilities. Certain states in the region       have undertaken and released a study investigating the costs and benefits of       SPP       developing into a RTO that administers energy and associated       markets.
The       remaining west zone public utility subsidiaries (TCC and TNC) are members of       ERCOT.
See       Note       4 to the consolidated financial statements, entitled Rate       Matters ,       included in the 2005 Annual Reports under the heading entitled RTO       Formation/Integration Costs and Transmission Rate Proceedings at the FERC for a       discussion of public utility subsidiary participation in RTOs.
REGULATION General Except       for retail generation sales in Ohio, Virginia and the ERCOT area of Texas,       AEPs       public utility subsidiaries retail rates and certain other matters are subject       to traditional regulation by the state utility commissions. While still       regulated, retail sales in Michigan are now made at unbundled rates. See Item       1 - Utility Operations - Electric Restructuring and Customer Choice Legislation and Rates, below.       AEPs subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FERC under the FPA.       I&M is subject to regulation by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,       as amended, with respect to the operation of the Cook Plant. AEP and its public       utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of EPACT,       much of which is administered by the FERC. EPACT contains key provisions       affecting the electric power industry. These provisions include tax changes       for       the utility industry, incentives for emissions reductions and federal insurance       and incentives to build new nuclear power plants. It gives the FERC backstop transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight.       The       law also provides incentives and funding for clean coal technologies and       initiatives to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gases.
Rates Historically,       state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a       cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity       to       recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its       investment used in providing that service. A utilitys cost of service generally       reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense,       depreciation expense and taxes. State utility commissions periodically adjust       rates pursuant to a review of (i) a utilitys revenues and expenses during a       defined test period and (ii) such utilitys level of investment. Absent a legal       limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping       rates for a period of time as part of a transition to customer choice of       generation suppliers, a state utility commission can review and change rates       on       its own initiative. Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a       utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers.       Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of       or       changes to rates for a specified period of time.
The       rates       of AEPs public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of       providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission       and distribution service). In Ohio, Virginia and the ERCOT area of Texas, rates       are transitioning from bundled cost-based rates for electric service to       unbundled cost-based rates for transmission and distribution service on the       one       hand, and market pricing for and/or customer choice of generation on the other.       In Ohio, the PUCO has approved the rate stabilization plans filed by OPCo and       CSPCo which, among other things, address retail generation service rates through       December 31, 2008. In Virginia, APCos base rates are currently capped, subject       to certain adjustments described below, at their mid-1999 levels until December       31, 2010, or sooner if the VSCC finds that a competitive market for generation       exists in Virginia.
Historically,       the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP System reflected       specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates       or       incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utilitys rates and tariffs. Fuel       adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from       customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost       changes. While the historical framework remains in a portion of AEPs service       territory, recovery of increased fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause       is       no longer provided for in Ohio. We are seeking to reactivate fuel clause       mechanisms in West Virginia and have received approval from the WVPSC to begin       deferral accounting associated with the fuel clause mechanism effective July       1,       2006. Fuel recovery is also limited in the ERCOT area of Texas, but because       we       mainly serve customers through unaffiliated REPs, there is little impact on       AEP       of fuel recovery procedures related to service in ERCOT.
The       following state-by-state analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of       each       jurisdiction in which AEP operates. Several public utility subsidiaries operate       in more than one jurisdiction.
Indiana :       I&M       provides retail electric service in Indiana at bundled rates approved by the       IURC. While rates are set on a cost-of-service basis, I&Ms base rates are       capped through June 30, 2007. Its fuel recovery rate is capped through that       time       period at a level that automatically increased in January 2006 and will do       so       again in January 2007. I&M expects, however, that its actual fuel costs will       exceed the capped fuel rates permitted through June 30, 2007. See Note 4 to       the       consolidated financial statements, entitled Rate       Matters - I&M Indiana Settlement Agreement, included       in the 2005 Annual Reports, for more information.
Ohio : CSPCo       and       OPCo each operated as a functionally separated utility and provided default retail electric service to customers at unbundled rates pursuant to the Ohio       Act       through December 31, 2005. The PUCO approved the rate stabilization plan filed       by CSPCo and OPCo (which, among other things, addresses default retail       generation service rates from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2008).       T he       Ohio       Consumers' Counsel has       appealed the PUCOs approval of the rate stabilization plans. Retail generation       rates will be determined consistent with the rate stabilization plan until       December 31, 2008. CSPCo and OPCo are providing and will continue to provide       distribution services to retail customers at rates approved by the PUCO. These       rates will be frozen (with certain exceptions, including automatic annual       increases in generation rates of 3% and 7% for CSPCo and OPCo, respectively)       from their levels as of December 31, 2005 through December 31, 2008.       Transmission services will continue to be provided at rates established by       the       FERC. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, entitled Customer       Choice and Industry Restructuring ,       included in the 2005 Annual Reports, for more information.
Oklahoma : PSO       provides retail electric service in Oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the       OCC. PSOs rates are set on a cost-of-service basis. Fuel and purchased energy       costs above the amount included in base rates are recovered by applying a fuel       adjustment factor to retail kilowatt-hour sales. The factor is generally       adjusted annually and is based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs.       Over or under collections of fuel costs for prior periods are returned to or       recovered from customers when new annual factors are established. See Note       4 to       the consolidated financial statements, entitled Rate       Matters ,       included in the 2005 Annual Reports, for information regarding current rate       proceedings.
Texas: TCC       has       sold substantially all of its generation assets and TNC currently operates       on a       functionally separated basis. TCC and TNC serve most of their retail customers       in the ERCOT area of Texas through non-affiliated REPs. TCC and TNC provide       retail transmission and distribution service on a cost-of-service basis at       rates       approved by the PUCT and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved       by the FERC consistent with PUCT rules. See Notes 4 and 6 to the consolidated       financial statements, entitled Rate       Matters and Customer Choice and Industry Restructuring ,       respectively, included in the 2005 Annual Reports, for information on current       rate proceedings and TCCs true-up proceedings.
In       May       2003, the PUCT delayed competition in the SPP area of Texas until at least       January 1, 2007. As such, SWEPCos Texas operations continue to operate and to       be regulated as a traditional bundled utility with both base and fuel       rates.
Virginia: APCo       provides retail electric service in Virginia at unbundled rates. APCos       unbundled generation, transmission (which reflect FERC approved transmission       rates) and distribution rates as well as its functional separation plan were       approved by the VSCC in December 2001. APCOs base rates are capped at their       mid-1999 levels until the end of the transition period (now December 31, 2010),       or sooner if the VSCC finds that a competitive market for generation exists       in       Virginia. APCo is permitted to seek two changes to its capped rates through       December 31, 2010. In addition, APCo is entitled to annual rate changes to       recover the incremental costs it incurs for transmission and distribution       reliability and compliance with state or federal environmental laws or       regulations. APCo is entitled to adjustments to fuel rates through 2010 to       recover its actual fuel costs, the fuel component of its purchased power costs       and certain capacity charges. APCo recovers its generation capacity charges       through capped base rates. In July 2005, APCo filed a request with the VSCC       seeking approval to recover additional environmental and reliability-related       costs. The request is currently pending before the VSCC. See Note 4 to the       consolidated financial statements, entitled Rate       Matters ,       included in the 2005 Annual Reports, for additional information on current       rate       proceedings.
West       Virginia : APCo       and       WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC.       While West Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs, an       earlier rate proceeding for both APCo and WPCo resulted in the suspension of       their operative fuel clause mechanisms (though they continue to recover a fixed       level of fuel costs through bundled rates). In August 2005, APCo and WPCo       collectively filed an application with the WVPSC seeking an increase in their       retail rates and the reactivation of their suspended operative fuel clause       and       other recovery mechanisms. That matter is currently pending before the WVPSC.       We       have received approval from the WVPSC to begin deferral accounting associated       with the fuel clause mechanism effective July 1, 2006. See Note 4 to the       consolidated financial statements, entitled Rate       Matters ,       included in the 2005 Annual Reports, for additional information on current       rate       proceedings.
Other       Jurisdictions : The       public utility subsidiaries of AEP also provide service at regulated bundled       rates in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Tennessee and regulated unbundled       rates in Michigan.
The       following table illustrates the current rate regulation status of the states       in       which the public utility subsidiaries of AEP operate: Fuel                 Clause Rates(7) Off-System                 Sales Profits Percentage                 of AEP System Status                 of Base Rates for Shared                 with Retail Jurisdiction Power                 Supply Energy                 Delivery Status Ratepayers Revenues(1) Ohio See                 footnote 2 Distribution                 frozen through 2008(2) None Not                 applicable 31% Oklahoma Frozen                 through April 2006 Frozen                 through April 2006 Active Yes 14% Texas                 ERCOT See                 footnote 3 Not                 capped or frozen Not                 applicable Not                 applicable 7%(3) Texas                 SPP Not                 capped or frozen Not                 capped or frozen Active Yes,                 above base levels 5%(3) Indiana Capped                 until 6/30/07 Capped                 until 6/30/07 Capped                 until 6/30/07 (4) No 11% Virginia Capped                 until as late as 12/31/10(5) Capped                 until as late as 12/31/10(5) Active No 9% West                 Virginia Not                 capped or frozen Not                 capped or frozen Suspended                 (6) Yes,                 but suspended (6) 9% Louisiana Not                 capped or frozen Not                 capped or frozen Active Yes,                 above base levels 4% Kentucky Not                 capped or frozen Not                 capped or frozen Active Yes,                 above and below base levels 4% Arkansas Not                 capped or frozen Not                 capped or frozen Active Yes,                 above base levels 3% Michigan Not                 capped or frozen Not                 capped or frozen Active Yes,                 in some areas 2% Tennessee Not                 capped or frozen Not                 capped or frozen Active No 1% (1) Represents                 the percentage of revenues from sales to retail customers from AEP                 utility                 companies operating in each state to the total AEP System revenues                 from                 sales to retail customers for the year ended December 31,                 2005.

Distribution rates are frozen, with certain exceptions, through December                 31, 2008.
(3) Retail                 electric service in the ERCOT area of Texas is provided to most customers                 through unaffiliated REPs with TCC and TNC providing only regulated                 delivery services. Retail electric service in the SPP area of Texas                 is                 provided by SWEPCo and an affiliated                 REP.
(4) Fuel                 rates capped through June 2007 billing month at increasing rates                 subject                 to certain events at the Cook                 Plant.
(5) Legislation                 passed in 2004 capped base rates until December 31, 2010 and expanded                 the                 rate change opportunities to one full rate case (including generation,                 transmission and distribution) between July 1, 2004 and June 30,                 2007 and                 one additional full rate case between July 1, 2007 and December 31,                 2010.                 The new law also permits APCo to recover, on a timely basis, incremental                 costs incurred on and after July 1, 2004 for transmission and distribution                 reliability purposes and to comply with state and federal environmental                 laws and regulations.
(6) ENEC                 was suspended in West Virginia pursuant to a 1999 rate case stipulation.                 We are seeking to reactivate ENEC and have received approval from                 the                 WVPSC to begin deferral accounting associated with it effective July                 1,                 2006.
(7) Includes,                 where applicable, fuel and fuel portion of purchased                 power.
FERC Under       the       FPA, FERC regulates rates for interstate sales at wholesale, transmission of       electric power, accounting and other matters, including construction and       operation of hydroelectric projects. FERC regulations require AEP to provide       open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates. FERC also regulates       unbundled transmission service to retail customers. FERC also regulates the       sale       of power for resale in interstate commerce by (i) approving contracts for       wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and (ii) granting       authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at market-based rates       upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market       prices. Except for wholesale power that AEP delivers within its control area       of       the SPP, AEP has market-rate authority from FERC, under which most of its       wholesale marketing activity takes place.
As       a       result of PUHCAs repeal, jurisdiction over certain holding company related       activities has been transferred to the FERC. Specifically, the FERC has       jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of our public utility       subsidiaries, the acquisition of securities of utilities, the acquisition or       sale of certain utility assets, and mergers with another electric utility or       holding company. In addition, both FERC and state regulators will be permitted       to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system.       EPACT gives the FERC backstop transmission siting authority as well as       increased utility merger oversight.
ELECTRIC       RESTRUCTURING AND CUSTOMER CHOICE LEGISLATION Certain       states in AEPs service area have adopted restructuring or customer choice       legislation. In general, this legislation provides for a transition from bundled       cost-based rate regulated electric service to unbundled cost-based rates for       transmission and distribution service and market pricing for the supply of       electricity with customer choice of supplier. At a minimum, this legislation       allows retail customers to select alternative generation suppliers. Electric       restructuring and/or customer choice began on January 1, 2001 in Ohio and on       January 1, 2002 in Michigan, Virginia and the ERCOT area of Texas. Electric       restructuring in the SPP area of Texas has been delayed by the PUCT until at       least 2007. AEPs public utility subsidiaries operate in both the ERCOT and SPP       areas of Texas.
See       Note       5 to the consolidated financial statements, entitled Effects       of Regulation ,       included in the 2005 Annual Reports, for a discussion of the effect of       restructuring and customer choice legislation on accounting procedures. See       Note       6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled Customer       Choice and Industry Restructuring for       additional information.
Ohio       Restructuring The       Ohio       Act requires vertically integrated electric utility companies that offer       competitive retail electric service in Ohio to separate their generating       functions from their transmission and distribution functions. Following the       market development period (which ended December 31, 2005), retail customers       receive distribution and, where applicable, transmission service from the       incumbent utility whose distribution rates are approved by the PUCO and whose       transmission rates are approved by the FERC. The PUCO approved CSPCos and       OPCos rate stabilization plans that, among other things, addressed default       generation service rates from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2008. See Item       1 - Utility Operations - RegulationFERC for       a       discussion of FERC regulation of transmission rates, RegulationRatesOhio and       Note       4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled Rate       Matters ,       included in the 2005 Annual Reports , for       a       discussion of the impact of restructuring on distribution rates. The PUCO       authorized CSPCo and OPCo to remain functionally separated through the end       of       that three-year period. The PUCOs order has been appealed to the Supreme Court       of Ohio by the       Ohio       Consumers' Counsel .
Texas       Restructuring Signed       into law in June of 1999, the Texas Act substantially amended the regulatory       structure governing electric utilities in Texas in order to allow retail       electric competition for all customers. Among other things, the Texas       Act:  gave                 Texas customers the opportunity to choose their REP beginning January                 1,                 2002 (delayed until at least 2007 in the SPP portion of                 Texas),  required                 each utility to legally separate into a REP, a power generation company,                 and a transmission and distribution utility,                 and  required                 that REPs provide electricity at generally unregulated rates, except                 that                 until January 1, 2007 the prices that may be charged to residential                 and                 small commercial customers by REPs affiliated with a utility within                 the                 affiliated utilitys service area are set by the PUCT, until certain                 conditions in the Texas Act are met.
The       Texas       Act provides each affected utility an opportunity to recover its generation       related regulatory assets and stranded costs resulting from the legal separation       of the transmission and distribution utility from the generation facilities       and       the related introduction of retail electric competition. Regulatory assets       consist of the Texas jurisdictional amount of generation-related regulatory       assets and liabilities in the audited financial statements as of December 31,       1998. Stranded costs consist of the positive excess of the net regulated book       value of generation assets (as of December 31, 2001) over the market value       of       those assets, taking specified factors into account, as ultimately determined       in       a PUCT true-up proceeding.
In       May       2005, TCC filed its stranded cost quantification application, or true-up       proceeding, with the       PUCT seeking recovery of $2.4 billion of net stranded generation costs and       other       recoverable true-up items. A final order was issued in February 2006. In the       final order, the PUCT determined TCCs net stranded generation costs and other       recoverable true-up items to be approximately $1.475 billion. Other parties       may       appeal the PUCTs final order as unwarranted or too large; we expect to appeal       seeking additional recovery consistent with the Texas Act and related rules.
For       a       discussion of (i) regulatory assets and stranded costs subject to recovery       by       TCC and (ii) rate adjustments made after implementation of restructuring to       allow recovery of certain costs by or with respect to TCC and TNC, see Note       6 to       the consolidated financial statements entitled Customer       Choice and Industry Restructuring included       in the 2005 Annual Reports .
Michigan       Customer Choice Customer       choice commenced for I&Ms Michigan customers on January 1, 2002. Rates for       retail electric service for I&Ms Michigan customers were unbundled (though       they continue to be regulated) to allow customers the ability to evaluate the       cost of generation service for comparison with other suppliers. At December       31,       2005, none of I&Ms Michigan customers have elected to change suppliers and       no alternative electric suppliers are registered to compete in I&Ms       Michigan service territory.
Virginia       Restructuring In       April       2004, the Governor of Virginia signed legislation that extends the transition       period for electricity restructuring, including capped rates, through December       31, 2010. The legislation provides specified cost recovery opportunities during       the capped rate period, including two optional general base rate changes and       an       opportunity for timely recovery, through a separate rate mechanism, of certain       incremental environmental and reliability costs incurred on and after July       1,       2004.
COMPETITION The       public utility subsidiaries of AEP, like the electric industry generally, face       competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis, primarily       to       other public utilities and power marketers. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 was       designed, among other things, to foster competition in the wholesale market       by       creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that       all       generators have equal access to transmission services. As a result, there are       more generators able to participate in this market. The principal factors in       competing for wholesale sales are price (including fuel costs), availability       of       capacity and power and reliability of service.
AEPs       public utility subsidiaries also compete with self-generation and with       distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil and coal,       within their service areas. The primary factors in such competition are price,       reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of       energy other than electric power. With respect to competing generators and       self-generation, the public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that they       generally maintain a favorable competitive position. With respect to alternative       sources of energy, the public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that the       reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute       other cost-effective sources for electric power place them in a favorable       competitive position, even though their prices may be higher than the costs       of       some other sources of energy.
Significant       changes in the global economy in recent years have led to increased price       competition for industrial customers in the United States, including those       served by the AEP System. Some of these industrial customers have requested       price reductions from their suppliers of electric power. In addition, industrial       customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based       upon       its costs, which may include, among other things, the cost of electric power.       The public utility subsidiaries of AEP cooperate with such customers to meet       their business needs through, for example, providing various off-peak or       interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with the various state       commissions. Occasionally, these rates are first negotiated, and then filed       with       the state commissions. The public utility subsidiaries believe that they are       unlikely to be materially adversely affected by this competition.
SEASONALITY The       sale       of electric power is generally a seasonal business. In many parts of the       country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices       also peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.       The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of       AEPs facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which AEP enters. In       addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less       income, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future       could diminish AEPs results of operations and may impact its financial       condition. Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase       AEPs       results of operations.
INVESTMENTS GAS       OPERATIONS In       January 2005, we sold a 98% controlling interest in HPL and related assets       with       the remaining 2% interest being sold to the buyer in November 2005. See Note       10       to the consolidated financial statements entitled Acquisitions,       Dispositions, Discontinued Operations, Impairments, Assets Held for Sale and       Other Losses ,       included in the 2005 Annual Reports for more information. As a result,       management anticipates that our gas marketing operations will be limited to       managing our obligations with respect to the gas transactions entered into       before these sales.
OTHER General Through       certain subsidiaries, AEP conducts certain business operations other than those       included in other segments in which it uses and manages a portfolio of       energy-related assets. The assets currently used and managed       include:  791                 MW of domestic power generation facilities (of which AEP ownership                 is                 approximately 551 MW);  Undeveloped                 and formerly operated coal properties and related facilities; and  Barge,                 rail and other fuel transportation related assets.
These       operations include the following activities:  Entering                 into long-term transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy, and                 ancillary                 services of electric generating facilities at various locations in                 North                 America;  Holding                 various properties, coal reserves and royalty interests and reclaiming                 formerly operated mining properties in Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky,                 Louisiana, Ohio, Texas, Utah and West Virginia;                 and  Through                 AEP MEMCO LLC, transporting coal and dry bulk commodities, primarily                 on                 the Ohio, Illinois, and Lower Mississippi rivers for AEP, as well                 as                 unaffiliated customers. Through subsidiaries, AEP owns or leases                 more than                 7,000 railcars, 2,300 barges, 53 towboats and a coal handling terminal                 with 20 million tons of annual                 capacity.
AEP       has       in the past three years written down the value of certain of these investments.       See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements entitled Acquisitions,       Dispositions, Discontinued Operations, Impairments, Assets Held for Sale and       Other Losses, included       in the 2005 Annual Reports.
Dow       Chemical Cogeneration Facility Pursuant       to an agreement with Dow, AEP constructed a 880 MW cogeneration facility (Facility) at       Dows       chemical facility in Plaquemine, Louisiana that achieved commercial operation       status on March 18, 2004.
Dow       uses       a portion of the energy produced by the Facility and sells the excess power       to       us. We have agreed to sell up to all of the excess 800 MW to Tractebel at a       price that is currently in excess of market. Tractebel alleged that the power       purchase agreement was unenforceable. This agreement is now being litigated.
A       bench       trial was conducted in March and April 2005. In August 2005, a federal judge       ruled that Tractebel had breached the contract and awarded us damages of $123       million plus prejudgment interest. Both parties have filed appeals. In January       2006, the trial court increased AEPs judgment against Tractebel to $173 million       plus prejudgment interest. The power from the Facility is currently sold on       the       market. See Notes 7 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, entitled Commitments       and Contingencies and Acquisitions,       Dispositions, Discontinued Operations, Impairments, Assets Held for Sale and       Other Losses ,       respectively, included in the 2005 Annual Reports, for more       information.
ITEM       1A.
RISK       FACTORS General       Risks of Our Regulated Operations We       may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment       in       capital improvements and additions.
(Applies       to each registrant.) Our       business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and       additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits,       construction and/or acquisition of additional generation units and transmission       facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives.       Our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved       by       one or more regulatory commissions. If these regulatory commissions do not       approve adjustments to the rates we charge, we would not be able to recover       the       costs associated with our planned extensive investment. This would cause our       financial results to be diminished. While we may seek to limit the impact of       any       denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment,       there can no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts,       particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and       commitments.
Our       planned capital investment program coincides with a material increase in the       price of the fuels used to generate electricity. Many of our jurisdictions       have       fuel clauses that permit us to recover these increased fuel costs through rates       without a general rate case. While prudent capital investment and variable       fuel       costs each generally warrant recovery, in practical terms our regulators could       limit the amount or timing of increased costs that we would recover through       higher rates. Any such limitation could cause our financial results to be       diminished.
Our       request for rate recovery of additional costs may not be approved in       Virginia.
(Applies       to AEP and APCo.) On       July       1, 2005, APCo filed a request with the VSCC seeking approval for the recovery       of       $62 million in incremental costs through June 30, 2006. The $62 million request       included incurred and projected costs of environmental controls, transmission       costs (including line construction) and other system reliability work. In       October 2005, the VSCC ruled that it does not have the authority to approve       the       recovery of projected costs. In November 2005, APCo filed supplemental testimony       in which it updated the actual costs through September 2005 and reduced its       requested recovery to $21 million. The staff of the VSCC has made filings to       dismiss the transmission system reliability costs from consideration for       recovery, arguing that the FERC, and not the VSCC, has jurisdiction over the       unbundled transmission component of APCo's retail rates. Through December 31,       2005, APCo has deferred $24 million of recorded costs that are subject to this       proceeding (which does not include $4 million of related equity carrying costs).       The staff of the VSCC has issued testimony that would reduce APCos recovery of       current and future costs to $20 million. If the VSCC denies recovery of any       of       APCos deferred costs, it would adversely impact future results of operations       and cash flows.
Our       request for rate recovery of additional costs may not be approved in West       Virginia.
(Applies       to AEP and APCo.) In       August       2005, APCo and WPCo collectively filed an application (amended in January 2006)       with the WVPSC seeking an initial increase in their retail base rates of       approximately $73 million. Most of the requested base rate increase is       attributable to reactivating the currently suspended ENEC mechanism that       provides recovery of power supply costs, including fuel and purchased power,       while the rest is primarily related to the recovery of the costs associated       with       the Ceredo Generating Station and service reliability improvements. The first       supplemental increase of $9 million, requested to be effective at the same       time       as the base rate change, provides for recovery of the capital costs of the       Wyoming Jackson's Ferry 765kV line. The remaining proposed supplemental       increases are $43 million, $8 million and $36 million, to be effective on       January 1, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively, provide for recovery of       environmental expenditures. APCo has a regulatory liability of $52 million       of       pre-suspension, previously over-recovered ENEC costs which, along with a       carrying cost, it is proposing to apply in the future to any future       under-recoveries of ENEC costs through the reactivated ENEC mechanism. The       WVPSC       has granted a joint motion that requested hearings begin April 17, 2006, that       new rates go into effect on July 28, 2006 and that deferral accounting for       over-       or under-recovery of the ENEC begin July 1, 2006. If the WVPSC denies the       requested rate recovery, it could adversely impact future results of operations       and cash flows.
Our       request for rate recovery of additional costs may not be approved in       Kentucky.
(Applies       to AEP and KPCo.) In       September 2005, KPCo filed a request with the Kentucky Public Service Commission       to increase base rates by approximately $65 million to recover increasing costs.       The major components of the rate increase included a return on common equity       of       11.5% or $26 million, the recovery of transmission costs of $10 million, the       recovery of additional capacity costs of $9 million, additional reliability       spending of $7 million and increased depreciation expense of $5 million. We       have       entered into a settlement agreement with intervenors that provides an increase       in base rates of approximately $41 million. If the Kentucky Public Service       Commission does not approve the settlement or otherwise denies the requested       rate recovery, it could adversely impact future results of operations and cash       flows.
We       may not be able to recover all of our fuel costs in Indiana.
(Applies       to AEP and I&M.) In       2003,       I&Ms fuel and base rates in Indiana were frozen through a prior agreement.       In 2004, the IURC ordered the continuation of the fixed fuel adjustment charge       on an interim basis through March 2005, pending the outcome of negotiations.
Certain       of the parties to the negotiations reached a settlement. The IURC approved       the       agreement on June 1, 2005.
The       approved settlement caps fuel rates for the March 2004 through June 2007 billing       months at increasing rates during agreed-upon intervals. I&M experienced a       cumulative under-recovery of fuel costs for the period March 2004 through       December 2005. If future fuel costs through June 30, 2007 continue to exceed       the       agreed-upon caps, future results of operations and cash flows would be adversely       affected.
The       rates that SWEPCo may charge its customers may be reduced.
(Applies to SWEPCo.) In       October 2005, the staff of the PUCT reported results of its review of SWEPCos       year-end 2004 earnings. Based upon the staffs adjustments to the information       submitted by SWEPCo, the report indicates that SWEPCo is receiving excess       revenues of approximately $15 million. The staff has engaged SWEPCo in       discussions to reconcile the earnings calculation and consider possible ways       to       address the results. Separately, at the time of the CSW merger, SWEPCO agreed       to       file with the LPSC detailed financial information typically utilized in a       revenue requirement filing on a periodic basis in order to demonstrate the       lack       of adverse impact from the merger. The first such filing was in October 2002       and       the second was in April 2004. While both filings indicated that SWEPCos rates       should not be reduced, direct testimony filed by staff of the LPSC recommends       a       $15 million reduction in SWEPCos Louisiana jurisdictional base rates. SWEPCo       has filed rebuttal testimony and additional discovery is planned. In a separate       matter, in November 2005 the LPSC included SWEPCo in an inquiry initiated to       determine whether utilities had purchased fuel and power at the lowest possible       price and whether suppliers offered competitive prices for fuel and purchased       power during the period of January 1, 2005 through October 31, 2005. As a       result, the LPSC is conducting an audit of SWEPCos historical fuel costs for       the years 2003 and 2004. At this time, management is unable to predict the       outcome of these proceedings. If a rate reduction is ordered in the future,       it       would adversely impact future results of operations and cash flows.
The       amount that PSO seeks to recover for fuel costs is currently being       reviewed.
(Applies       to PSO.) In       2002,       PSO experienced a $44 million under-recovery of fuel costs resulting from a       reallocation among AEPs West zone public utility subsidiaries of purchased       power costs for periods prior to January 1, 2002. In July 2003, PSO filed with       the OCC offering to collect the under-recovery over 18 months. An intervenor,       the staff of the OCC and the Attorney General of Oklahoma have made filings       indicating that recovery should be reduced substantially or disallowed       altogether. These filings disputed the allocation of AEP System off-system       sales       margins pursuant to an agreement approved by FERC. In September 2003, the OCC       expanded the case to include a full review of PSOs 2001 fuel and purchased       power practices. The allocation issue was referred to an ALJ. The ALJ       recommended that the OCC lacks authority to examine whether PSO deviated from       the FERC allocation methodology and that any such complaints should be addressed       at the FERC. The OCC conducted a hearing on the jurisdictional matter in January       2005 but has not issued a decision.
If       the       OCC determines, as a result of the review, that a portion of PSOs fuel and       purchased power costs should not be recovered, there could be an adverse effect       on PSOs results of operations, cash flows and possibly financial       condition.
The       internal allocation of AEP System off-system sales margins has been challenged.
(Applies       to APCo, CSPCo, I&M, KPCo and OPCo.) Off-system       sales margins are allocated among the AEP System companies pursuant to a       FERC-approved agreement among those companies entered into at the time of the       merger with CSW. In November 2005, we filed with the FERC a proposed allocation       methodology to be used in 2006 and beyond. The original allocations have been       challenged in different forums, including PSOs fuel clause recovery proceeding       before the OCC. In general, the challenges assert that AEPs West zone public       utility subsidiaries, acquired in the merger with CSW, are being allocated       a       disproportionately small amount of the off-system sales margins. An ALJ in       the       OCC proceeding and, separately, a federal district court in Texas have each       held       that the FERC is the only appropriate adjudicator of such challenges. No       proceeding questioning the allocation of our off-system sales is currently       before the FERC; the OCC, however, has yet to rule on whether it has       jurisdiction over this issue. If the FERC or another entity of competent       authority were to retroactively allocate additional off-system sales margins       to       the West zone public utility subsidiaries, the East zone public utility       subsidiaries may be required to pay money to the West zone public utility       subsidiaries. Any such payments could       have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and possibly       financial condition of the East       zone       public utility subsidiaries.
The       base rates that certain of our utilities charge are currently capped or       frozen.
(Applies to AEP, CSPCo, I&M and OPCo.) Base       rates charged to customers in Michigan and Ohio are currently either frozen       or       capped. To the extent our costs in these states exceed the applicable cap or       frozen rate, those costs are not recoverable from customers.
Certain       of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond       our control.
(Applies       to each registrant.) Unless       mitigated by timely and adequate regulatory recovery, the cost of repairing       damage to our utility facilities due to storms, natural disasters, wars,       terrorist acts and other catastrophic events, in excess of insurance coverage,       when applicable, may adversely impact our revenues, operating and capital       expenses and results of operations. Such events may also create additional       risks       related to the supply and/or cost of equipment and materials.
We       are exposed to nuclear generation risk.
(Applies to AEP and I&M.) Through       I&M, we own the Cook Plant. It consists of two nuclear generating units for       a rated capacity of 2,143 MW, or 6% of our generation capacity. We are,       therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the       following:  the                 potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting                 from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling                 and                 disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear                 fuel;  limitations                 on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover                 losses that might arise in connection with our nuclear                 operations;  uncertainties                 with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts if insurance                 coverage                 is inadequate (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase                 the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and                 potentially contribute to the losses of others);                 and,  uncertainties                 with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning                 nuclear plants at the end of their licensed                 lives.
There       can       be no assurance that I&Ms preparations or risk mitigation measures will be       adequate if and when these risks are triggered.
The       NRC       has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related       requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event       of       non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit,       or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until       compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC       could       necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours.       In       addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident       at       our plants, if an incident did occur, it could harm our results of operations       or       financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the       world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of       any       domestic nuclear unit. Moreover, a major incident at a nuclear facility in       the       U.S. could require us to make material contributory payments.
The       different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the       future have changing transmission regulatory structures, which could affect       our       performance in these regions.
(Applies to each registrant.) Our       results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission       regulatory structures in various regional power markets. Problems or delays       that       may arise in the operation of new regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, may restrict our ability to sell power produced by our generating       capacity to certain markets if there is insufficient transmission capacity       otherwise available. The rules governing the various regional power markets       may       also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues. Because       it remains unclear which companies will be participating in the various regional       power markets, or the manner in which RTOs will evolve or the regions they       will       cover, we are unable to assess fully the impact that these power markets may       have on our business.
AEPs       East zone public utility subsidiaries joined PJM on October1, 2004. SWEPCo       and PSO are members of SPP.
In       February 2004, FERC granted RTO status to SPP, subject to fulfilling specified       requirements. In October 2004, the FERC issued an order granting final RTO       status to SPP subject to certain filings.
The       utility commissions of Louisiana and Arkansas are concerned about the effect       on       retail ratepayers of utilities in Louisiana and Arkansas joining RTOs. These       commissions have ordered the utilities in those states, including us, to analyze       and submit to them the costs and benefits of RTO options available to the       utilities. Certain states in the region have undertaken and released a study       investigating the costs and benefits of SPP developing into a RTO that       administers energy and associated markets.
To       the       extent we are faced with conflicting state and Federal requirements as to our       participation in RTOs, it could adversely affect our ability to operate and       recover transmission costs from retail customers. Management is unable to       predict the outcome of these transmission regulatory actions and proceedings       or       their impact on the timing and operation of RTOs, our transmission operations       or       future results of operations and cash flows.
The       amount we charge third parties for using our transmission facilities may be       reduced and not recovered.
(Applies       to AEP and AEPs       East zone public utility subsidiaries .) In       July       2003, the FERC issued an order directing PJM and the MISO to make compliance       filings for their respective OATTs to eliminate the transaction-based charges       for through and out (T&O) transmission service on transactions where the       energy is delivered within the proposed MISO and PJM expanded regions (Combined       Footprint). The elimination of the T&O rates reduces the transmission       service revenues collected by the RTOs and thereby reduces the revenues received       by transmission owners under the RTOs revenue distribution protocols. To       mitigate the impact of lost T&O revenues, the FERC approved temporary       replacement seams elimination cost adjustment (SECA) transition rates beginning       in December 2004 and extending through March 2006. Intervenors objected to       this       decision and SECA fees are being collected subject to refund while FERC       considers the issue.
SECA       transition rates have       not       fully compensated AEP for lost T&O revenues .       AEPs       East zone public utility subsidiaries received approximately $1 96 million       of T&O rate revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2004, the       last twelve months prior to joining PJM. AEPs East zone public utility       subsidiaries recognized net SECA revenues of $128 million in 2005. SECA       transition rates expire at the end of March 2006, after which, all transmission       costs that would otherwise have been covered by T&O rates in the Combined       Footprint will be subject to recovery from native load customers of AEPs East       zone public utility subsidiaries .       A rate       request is pending in West Virginia and a settlement agreement is pending in       Kentucky that address the reduction in these transmission revenues. In February       2006, CSPCo and OPCo filed with the PUCO to increase their transmission rates       to       reflect the loss of their share of SECA revenues.
At this       time, management is unable to predict whether any resultant increase in rates       applicable to AEPs internal load will be recoverable on a timely basis from       state retail customers.
In       addition to seeking retail rate recovery from the applicable states, AEP and       another member of PJM have filed an application with the FERC seeking       compensation from other unaffiliated members of PJM for the costs associated       with those members use of our respective transmission assets.
A       majority of PJM members have filed in opposition to the proposal. The case       is       scheduled for hearing in April 2006. AEP management cannot at this time estimate       the outcome of the proceeding.
Rate       regulation may delay or deny full recovery of costs.
(Applies       to each registrant.) Our       public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by       one       or more regulatory commissions. These rates are generally regulated based on       an       analysis of the applicable utilitys expenses incurred in a test year. Thus, the       rates a utility is allowed to charge may or may not match its expenses at any       given time. Additionally, there may also be a delay between the timing of when       these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered. While rate       regulation is premised on providing a reasonable opportunity to earn a       reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that       the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been       prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined       will always result in rates that will produce full recovery of our costs in       a       timely manner.
We       operate in a non-uniform and fluid regulatory environment.
(Applies to each registrant.) In       addition to the multiple levels of state regulation at the states in which       we       operate, our business is subject to extensive federal regulation. There can       be       no assurance that (1) the federal legislative and regulatory initiatives (which       have occurred over the past few years and which have generally facilitated       competition in the energy sector) will continue or will not be reversed or       (2)       state regulation will not become significantly more restrictive. Further       alteration of the regulatory landscape in which we operate will impact the       effectiveness of our business plan and may, because of the continued       uncertainty, harm our financial condition and results of       operations.
At       times, demand for power could exceed our supply capacity .
(Applies to each registrant other than TCC and TNC.) We       are       currently obligated to supply power in parts of eleven states. From time to       time, because of unforeseen circumstances, the demand for power required to       meet       these obligations could exceed our available generation capacity. If this       occurs, we would have to buy power from the market. We may not always have       the       ability to pass these costs on to our customers because some of the states       we       operate in do not allow us to increase our rates in response to increased fuel       cost charges. Since these situations most often occur during periods of peak       demand, it is possible that the market price for power at that time would be       very high. Even if a supply shortage were brief, we could suffer substantial       losses that could reduce our results of operations.
Risks       Related to Market, Economic or Financial Volatility Downgrades       in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital       and/or to operate our power trading businesses.
(Applies to each registrant other than AEGCo.) Following       the bankruptcy of Enron, the credit ratings agencies initiated a thorough review       of the capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings of energy       companies, including us. The agencies revised ratings at that time. Further       negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our industry       and could limit our access to funding for our operations.
Our       business is capital intensive, and we are dependent upon our ability to access       capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability       to       access capital becomes significantly constrained, our interest costs will likely increase and our financial condition       could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely       affected.
If       Moodys or S&P were       to       downgrade the long-term rating of any of the registrants , particularly below investment grade, the borrowing costs of that registrant       would increase, which would diminish its financial results. In addition, the       registrants potential pool of investors and funding sources could       decrease.
Our       power       trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public       utility subsidiaries senior unsecured long-term debt. Most of our       counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to       stand behind transactions. If those ratings were to decline below investment       grade, our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be       diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cash-related       instruments which would reduce our profits.
AEP       has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due       it       from its subsidiaries.
(Applies       to AEP.) AEP       is a       holding company and has no operations of its own. Its ability to meet its       financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends       on       its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its       operating subsidiaries, primarily its regulated utilities, and the ability       of       its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from, AEP.
Its       subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation       (apart from loans from AEP) to provide AEP with funds for its payment       obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments. Payments       to       AEP by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business       considerations. In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions or advances       by the utility subsidiaries to AEP would be subject to regulatory or contractual       restrictions.
Our       operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly       basis .
(Applies to each registrant.) Electric       power generation is generally a seasonal business. In many parts of the country,       demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also       peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.       As a       result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially       on a seasonal basis. The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on       the       terms of power sale contracts that we enter into. In addition, we have       historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather       conditions are milder. We expect that unusually mild weather in the future       could       diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition.
Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEPs results of       operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.
Parties       we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to       perform their obligations, which could harm our results of       operations.
(Applies to each registrant.) Our       business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and       additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades, construction       of       additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other       initiatives. As a result, we have engaged numerous contractors and entered       into       a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials and/or obtain       the required construction related services. We are therefore exposed to the       risk       that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations       to us. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we       may       be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices       that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in       that       and related projects. Although our agreements are designed to mitigate the       consequences of a potential default by the counterparty, our actual exposure       may       be greater than these mitigation provisions. This would cause our financial       results to be diminished, and we might incur losses or delays in completing       construction.
Changes       in commodity prices may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the       amount we receive from selling power, harming our financial       performance .
(Applies to each registrant.) We       are       heavily exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal because most       of       our generating capacity is coal-fired. We have contracts of varying durations       for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity, but as       these contracts end or otherwise not honored, we may not be able to purchase       coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts. Similarly, we are heavily       exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances. We       use       emission allowances in direct proportion with the amount of coal we use as       fuel.       According to our estimates we have procured sufficient emission allowances       to       cover our projected needs for the next two years and for much of the projected       needs for periods beyond that. At some point, however, we will have to obtain       additional allowances and those purchases may not be on as favorable terms       as       those currently obtained.
We       also       own natural gas-fired facilities, which increases our exposure to the more       volatile market prices of natural gas.
The       price       trends for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material       increases that are expected to continue. Changes in the cost of coal, emission       allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs       and       the market prices of power will affect our financial results. Since the prices       we obtain for power may not change at the same rate as the change in coal,       emission allowances or natural gas costs, we may be unable to pass on the       changes in costs to our customers. In addition, the prices we can charge our       retail customers in some jurisdictions are capped and our fuel recovery       mechanisms in other states are frozen for various periods of time.
In       addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed       in       financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions,       and       those differences may be material. As a result, our financial results may be       diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to       market.
In       certain jurisdictions, we have limited ability to pass on our fuel costs to       our       customers.
(Applies to AEP, APCo, CSPCo, I&M and OPCo.) We       are       exposed to risk from changes in the market prices of coal, natural gas, and       emissions used to generate power where generation is no longer regulated or       where existing fuel clauses are suspended or frozen. The prices of coal, natural       gas and emissions have increased materially over the past several years, and       that trend is expected to continue. The protection afforded by retail fuel       clause recovery mechanisms has been eliminated by the implementation of customer       choice in Ohio. Because the risk of generating costs cannot be passed through       to       customers as a matter of right in Ohio, we retain these risks.
We       have       applied to reactivate the mechanism that provides recovery of power supply       costs, including fuel, in West Virginia; the mechanism was suspended by a       settlement reached in a state restructuring proceeding. The WVPSC has approved       commencement of deferral accounting related to power supply costs, including       fuel, effective July 1, 2006. A recently negotiated fuel cap in Indiana may       not       allow us to fully recover our fuel costs there. If we cannot recover an amount       sufficient to cover our actual fuel costs, our results of operations and cash       flows would be adversely affected.
We       are exposed to losses resulting from the bankruptcy of Enron       Corp.
(Applies to AEP.) On       June       1, 2001, we purchased Houston Pipe Line Company (HPL) from Enron Corp.       (Enron). Later that year, Enron and its subsidiaries filed bankruptcy       proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.       Various HPL related contingencies and indemnities from Enron remained unsettled       at the date of Enrons bankruptcy.
In       connection with the 2001 acquisition of HPL, we entered into an agreement with       BAM Lease Company, which granted HPL the exclusive right to use approximately       65       BCF of cushion gas required for the normal operation of the Bammel gas storage       facility. At the time of our acquisition of HPL, Bank of America (BOA) and       certain other banks (together with BOA, BOA Syndicate) and Enron entered into       an agreement granting HPL the exclusive use of 65 BCF of cushion gas.       Additionally, Enron and the BOA Syndicate released HPL from all prior and future       liabilities and obligations in connection with the financing arrangement.
After       the       Enron bankruptcy, HPL was informed by the BOA Syndicate of a purported default       by Enron under the terms of the financing arrangement. We are currently       litigating the rights to the cushion gas.
In       February 2004, in connection with BOAs dispute, Enron filed Notices of       Rejection regarding the cushion gas use agreement and other incidental       agreements. We have objected to Enrons attempted rejection of these agreements.       In 2005 we sold HPL, including the Bammel gas storage facility. We indemnified       the purchaser for damages, if any, arising from the litigation with BOA.
Management       is unable to predict the final resolution of these disputes, however the impact       on results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be       material.
Risks       Relating To State Restructuring We       may be required to serve former large industrial or commercial customers in       Ohio       at rates that are below market.
(Applies to AEP, CSPCo and OPCo.) Large       industrial or commercial customers in Ohio who switched from us to alternative       suppliers when customer choice became effective may successfully petition the       PUCO to require us to provide service to them at prices that may be below market       or that do not allow us to recover our costs. This may increase demand above       our       facilities available capacity or limit our ability to earn a return on the sale       of power. Thus, any such switching by customers could have an adverse effect       on       our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, to the extent       the power sold to meet the default service obligations could have been sold       to       third parties at more favorable wholesale prices, we will have incurred       potentially significant lost opportunity costs.
Some       laws and regulations governing restructuring in Virginia have not yet been       interpreted or adopted and could harm our business, operating results and       financial condition.
(Applies to AEP and APCo.) Virginia       restructuring legislation was enacted in 1999 providing for retail choice of       generation suppliers to be phased in over two years beginning January1,       2002. It required jurisdictional utilities to unbundle their power supply and       energy delivery rates and to file functional separation plans by January 1,       2002. APCo filed its plan with the VSCC and, following VSCC approval of a       settlement agreement, now operates in Virginia as a functionally separated       electric utility charging unbundled rates for its retail sales of electricity.       The settlement agreement addressed functional separation, leaving decisions       related to legal separation for later VSCC consideration. While the electric       restructuring law in Virginia established the general framework governing the       retail electric market, it required the VSCC to issue rules and determinations       implementing the law. Some of the regulations governing the retail electric       market have not yet been adopted by the VSCC. When the regulations are developed       and adopted, compliance with them may harm our business, results of operations       and financial condition.
There       is uncertainty as to our recovery of stranded costs resulting from industry       restructuring in Texas.
(Applies to AEP and TCC.) Restructuring       legislation in Texas required utilities with stranded costs to use market-based       methods to value certain generating assets for determining stranded costs.       We       elected to use the sale of assets method to determine the market value of the       generation assets of TCC for stranded cost purposes. In general terms, the       amount of stranded costs under this market valuation methodology is the amount       by which the book value of generating assets, including regulatory assets and       liabilities that were not securitized, exceeds the market value of the       generation assets, as measured by the net proceeds from the sale of the assets.
In       May       2005, TCC filed its stranded cost quantification application with the PUCT       seeking recovery of $2.4 billion of net stranded generation costs and other       recoverable true-up items. A final order was issued in February 2006. In the       final order, the PUCT determined TCCs net stranded generation costs and other       recoverable true-up items to be approximately $1.475 billion. Other parties       may       appeal the PUCTs final order as unwarranted or too large; we expect to appeal       seeking additional recovery consistent with the Texas Act and related rules.
If,       after       appeal, the amount of recovery is reduced or we are otherwise unable to recover       all or part of the net       stranded generation costs and other recoverable true-up items, it       could       have a material adverse effect on results of operations, cash flows and possibly       financial condition.
Collection       of our revenues in Texas is concentrated in a limited number of       REPs.
(Applies       to AEP, TCC and TNC.) Our       revenues from the distribution of electricity in the       ERCOT       area of Texas       are       collected from REPs that supply the electricity we distribute to their       customers. Currently, we do business with approximately sixty REPs. Adverse       economic conditions, structural problems in the new Texas market or financial       difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to       pay       for our services or could cause them to delay such payments. We depend on these       REPs for timely remittance of payments. Any delay or default in payment could       adversely affect the timing and receipt of our cash flows and thereby have       an       adverse effect on our liquidity.
Risks       Related to Owning and Operating Generation Assets and Selling       Power Our       costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant, and the cost of       compliance with future environmental laws could harm our cash flow and       profitability.
(Applies to each registrant other than TCC.) Our       operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental       statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste       management, natural resources and health and safety. Compliance with these       legal       requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental       monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and       permits at all of our facilities. These expenditures have been significant       in       the past, and we expect that they will increase in the future. Costs of       compliance with environmental regulations could adversely affect our results       of       operations and financial position, especially if emission and/or discharge       limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed,       additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we       operate increase. All of our estimates are subject to significant uncertainties       about the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables, including       timing of implementation, required levels of reductions, allocation requirements       of the new rules, and our selected compliance alternatives. As a result, we       cannot estimate our compliance costs with certainty. The actual costs to comply       could differ significantly from the estimates. All of the costs are incremental       to our current investment base and operating cost structure.
Governmental       authorities may assess penalties on us if it is determined that we have not       complied with environmental laws and regulations.
(Applies       to each registrant other than TCC.) If       we       fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by       factors beyond our control, that failure may result in the assessment of civil       or criminal penalties and fines against us. Recent lawsuits by the EPA and       various states filed against us highlight the environmental risks faced by       generating facilities, in general, and coal-fired generating facilities, in       particular.
Since       1999, we have been involved in litigation regarding generating plant emissions       under the Clean Air Act. EPA and a number of states alleged that we and other       unaffiliated utilities modified certain units at coal-fired generating plants       in       violation of the Clean Air Act. EPA filed complaints against certain AEP       subsidiaries in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. A       separate lawsuit initiated by certain special interest groups was consolidated       with the EPA case. The alleged modification of the generating units occurred       over a 20-year period.
A       bench       trial on the liability issues was held during July 2005. Briefing has concluded,       but no decision has been issued.
Additionally, in July 2004 attorneys general of eight states and others sued       AEP       and other utilities alleging that carbon dioxide emissions from power generating       facilities constitute a public nuisance under federal common law. The suits       were       dismissed by the trial court and plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal. While       we believe the claims are without merit, the costs associated with reducing       carbon dioxide emissions could harm our business and our results of operations       and financial position.
If       these       or other future actions are resolved against us, substantial modifications       of       our existing coal-fired power plants could be required. In addition, we could       be       required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment,       accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay penalties and/or halt       operations. Moreover, our results of operations and financial position could       be       reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense       of       ongoing litigation.
Our       revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market       risks that are beyond our control.
(Applies to each registrant other than TCC.) We       sell       power from our generation facilities into the spot market or other competitive       power markets or on a contractual basis. We also enter into contracts to       purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as       part       of our power marketing and energy trading operations. With respect to such       transactions, we are generally not guaranteed any rate of return on our capital       investments through mandated rates, and our revenues and results of operations       are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power       in       our regional markets and other competitive markets. These market prices may       fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time. Trading margins       may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain       should volatility decline. In addition, FERC, which has jurisdiction over       wholesale power rates, as well as RTOs that oversee some of these markets,       may       impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some       of       the volatility in these markets. Fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile,       and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate       as       changes in fuel and/or emissions costs. These factors could reduce our margins       and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations.
Volatility       in market prices for fuel and power may result from:  weather                 conditions;  seasonality;  power                 usage;  illiquid                 markets;  transmission                 or transportation constraints or                 inefficiencies;  availability                 of competitively priced alternative energy                 sources;  demand                 for energy commodities;  natural                 gas, crude oil and refined products, and coal production                 levels;  natural                 disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events;                 and  federal,                 state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and                 legislation.
Our       power trading (including coal, gas and e mission       allowances trading and power marketing) and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk       associated with these activities.
(Applies       to each registrant other than TCC.) Our       power       trading (including coal,       gas       and emission       allowances trading and power marketing) activities expose us to risks of       commodity price movements. We attempt to manage our exposure by establishing       and       enforcing of risk limits and risk management procedures. These risk limits       and       risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the       risks associated with these activities. As a result, we cannot predict the       impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our       business, operating results or financial position.
We       routinely have open trading positions in the market, within guidelines we set,       resulting from the management of our trading portfolio. To the extent open       trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish       our financial results and financial position.
Our       power       trading and risk management activities, including our power sales agreements       with counterparties, rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and       assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand       for power and other energy-related commodities. These factors become more       difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further       into       the future these estimates are made. Even when our policies and procedures       are       followed and decisions are made based on these estimates, results of operations       may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations       prove to be inaccurate.
Our       financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to operate       our       pooled electric generating facilities successfully.
(Applies to each registrant other than TCC.) Our       performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our electric       generating facilities. Operating electric generating facilities involves many       risks, including:  operator                 error and breakdown or failure of equipment or                 processes;  operating                 limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory                 requirements;  labor                 disputes;  fuel                 supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse                 weather, non-performance by our suppliers and other factors;                 and  catastrophic                 events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, terrorism,                 floods or other similar                 occurrences.
A       decrease or elimination of revenues from power produced by our electric       generating facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities       would adversely affect our results of operations.
Parties       with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could       harm our results of operations.
(Applies to each registrant.) We       are       exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach       their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to       perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or       honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed       our       contractual prices, which would cause our financial results to be diminished       and       we might incur losses. Although our estimates take into account the expected       probability of default by a counterparty, our actual exposure to a default       by a       counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.
We       are contractually required to operate a power generation facility that may       indirectly force us to sell the facilitys excess energy at a       loss.
(Applies to AEP.) We       have       agreed to lease from Juniper Capital L.P. a non-regulated merchant power       generation facility (Facility) near Plaquemine, Louisiana. We sublease the       Facility to Dow. We operate the Facility for Dow. Dow uses a portion of the       energy produced by the Facility and sells the excess power to us. We have agreed       to sell up to all of the excess 800 MW to Tractebel at a       price that is currently in excess of market. Tractebel alleged that the power       purchase agreement was unenforceable. This agreement is now being litigated.
A       bench       trial was conducted in March and April 2005. In August 2005, a federal judge       ruled that Tractebel had breached the contract and awarded us damages of $123       million plus prejudgment interest. Both parties have filed appeals. In January       2006, the trial court increased AEPs judgment against Tractebel to $173 million       plus prejudgment interest.
If       the       trial award is reversed or if Tractebel does not pay the judgment, our cash       flow       will be adversely affected. If the power agreement is held to be unenforceable,       we will be required to find new purchasers for up to 800MW. There can be       no assurance that the power produced will be sold at prices that will exceed       our       costs to produce it. If that were the case, as a result of our obligations       to       Dow, we would be required to operate the Facility at a loss.
We       rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control. If       these       facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity, we may not       be       able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our       power.
(Applies to each registrant other than TCC.) We       depend       on transmission facilities owned and operated by other unaffiliated power       companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale. This dependence exposes       us       to a variety of risks. If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity       is       inadequate, we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power. If       a       regions power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, our recovery of       wholesale costs and profits may be limited. If restrictive transmission price       regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient       incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.
The       FERC       has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission       services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales. Although these       initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for       electricity and gas, access to transmission systems may in fact not be available       if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or       because it is contractually unavailable. We also cannot predict whether       transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate       competitive access to those markets.
We       do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities.
(Applies to each registrant other than TCC.) We       routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas,       coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and       emission allowances trading operations. In connection with these trading       activities, we routinely enter into financial contracts, including futures       and       options, over-the counter options, financially-settled swaps and other       derivative contracts. These activities expose us to risks from price movements.       If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not       anticipate, it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial       contribution of our trading operations.
We       manage       our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset       some of our positions (i.e., to hedge our exposure to demand, market effects       of       weather and other changes in commodity prices). However, we do not always hedge       the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. To the       extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility, our results of       operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon       our       success in the market.

Net Capacity                 Factor values for 2003 and earlier, however, reflect previous Nominal                 Net                 Electrical Rating in Kilowatts of 1,020,000 (Unit 1) and 1,090,000                 (Unit                 2).
(c) The                 capacity factors for both units of the Cook Plant were reduced in                 2003 due                 to an unplanned maintenance outage to implement upgrades to the traveling                 water screens system following a fish intrusion.
Costs       associated with the operation (excluding fuel), maintenance and retirement       of       nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs       associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing       regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste       disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear       facilities. I&M may also incur costs and experience reduced output at Cook       Plant, because of the design criteria prevailing at the time of construction       and       the age of the plants systems and equipment. Nuclear industry-wide and Cook       Plant initiatives have contributed to slowing the growth of operating and       maintenance costs at these plants. However, the ability of I&M to obtain       adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not       assured. Such costs may include replacement power, any unamortized investment       at       the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature),       the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.
TRANSMISSION       AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES The       following table sets forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission       and       distribution lines of the AEP System and its operating companies and that       portion of the total representing 765kV lines: Total                 Overhead Circuit Miles of Transmission and Distribution                 Lines Circuit                 Miles of 765kV                 Lines AEP                 System (a) 219,114 (b) 2,026 APCo 51,337 644 CSPCo                 (a) 14,059  I&M 21,989 615 Kingsport                 Power Company 1,349  KPCo 10,857 258 OPCo 30,684 509 PSO 21,145  SWEPCo 20,552  TCC 29,405  TNC 16,039  WPCo 1,697  (a) Includes                 766 miles of 345kV jointly owned lines.

TITLES The       AEP       Systems generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee       simple. The greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the       System has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements       or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory       authority. The rights of AEPs public utility subsidiaries in the realty on       which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the       conduct of their business. Minor defects and irregularities customarily found       in       title to properties of like size and character may exist, but such defects       and       irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected       thereby. AEPs public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent       domain which permits them, if necessary, to acquire, perfect or secure titles       to       or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility       operations. Recent legislation in Ohio and Virginia has restricted the right       of       eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes.
Substantially       all the fixed physical properties and franchises of APCo and SWEPCo, except       for       limited exceptions, are subject to the lien of the mortgage and deed of trust       securing the first mortgage bonds of each such company.
SYSTEM       TRANSMISSION LINES AND FACILITY SITING Laws       in       the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Texas,       Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia require prior approval of sites of       generating facilities and/or routes of high-voltage transmission lines. We       have       experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result       of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes, and in proceedings in which       our operating companies have sought to acquire rights-of-way through       condemnation. These proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in       future years.
CONSTRUCTION       PROGRAM GENERAL With       input from its state utility commissions, the AEP System continuously assesses       the adequacy of its generation, transmission, distribution and other facilities       to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to       its       customers. In this assessment process, assumptions are continually being       reviewed as new information becomes available, and assessments and plans are       modified, as appropriate.
AEP       forecasts $3.7 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion of construction       expenditures for 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Estimated construction       expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based       on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations,       business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and the ability       to       access capital.
PROPOSED       TRANSMISSION FACILITIES AEP       has       filed a proposal with the FERC and the PJM to build a new 765kV transmission       line stretching from West Virginia to New Jersey. The proposed transmission       corridor will span approximately 550 miles and is designed to reduce PJM       congestion costs through enhancing transfer capability and also to reduce       transmission line losses. It also is expected to improve reliability in the       eastern transmission grid. AEPs proposed transmission line, called the AEP       Interstate Project, would originate at AEPs Amos transmission station in Putnam       County, WV, connect through Doubs Station in Frederick County, MD and terminate       at the Deans Station in Middlesex County, NJ. The proposed route follows a       corridor conceptually identified by PJM as a transmission route needed to       address transmission congestion within the PJM footprint. Exact routing of       the       line would be determined after PJM approves the project. AEP will work with       PJM,       other affected transmission owners and stakeholders throughout the siting       process. AEP also has filed with the DOE in its efforts to designate National       Interest Electric Transmission Corridors (NIETC). EPACT provides for NIETC       designation for areas that are experiencing electric energy transmission       capacity constraints or congestion that adversely affects consumers. It is       expected that a new AEP subsidiary, AEP Transmission Co., LLC, will own the       line       and undertake construction of the project. The projected costs are approximately       $3 billion, which may be shared with other stakeholders. The anticipated       in-service date is 2014 assuming three years to site and acquire rights-of-way       and five years to build the line.
APCo       is       continuing construction of the Jacksons       Ferry-Wyoming 765 kV       transmission line. The WVPSC and the VSCC have issued certificates authorizing       construction and operation of the line. On December 31, 2002, the U.S. Forest       Service issued a final environmental impact statement and record of decision       to       allow the use of federal lands in the Jefferson National Forest for construction       of a portion of the line. On May 11, 2004, the decision of the Forest Service       was challenged by the Sierra Club in the United States District Court for the       Western District of Virginia. APCo has intervened in that litigation .       Construction of the line is underway and the project is scheduled to be       completed by June 2006.
PROPOSED       GENERATION FACILITIES In       conjunction with an environmental impact study issued in August 2004, we       announced plans to construct a synthetic-gas-fired plant or plants of       approximately 1,000 MW of capacity in the next five to six years utilizing       integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology. We estimate that       this       new plant or plants will cost up to approximately $1.2 billion of direct costs       for a nominal 600 MW facility. We are currently performing site analysis and       evaluation and at the same time working with state regulators and legislators       to       establish a framework for expedient recovery of this significant investment       in       new clean coal technology before final site selection.
The       plans       are contingent upon receiving adequate cost recovery through rates approved       by       the applicable commission prior to beginning construction.
We have       filed an application in West Virginia seeking a certificate of public       convenience and necessity to construct an IGCC plant in New Haven, West       Virginia. In Ohio we filed an application with the PUCO requesting the approval       of a mechanism by which costs associated with constructing and operating an       IGCC       throughout the life of the facility can be recovered in rates authorized by       the       PUCO. We have also entered into an agreement with General Electric Company       and       Bechtel Power Corporation pursuant to which they are providing front-end       engineering and design for a nominal 600 MW IGCC facility.
Our       significant planned environmental investments in emission control installations       at existing coal-fired plants and our commitment to IGCC technology reinforce       our belief that coal will be a lower-emission domestic energy source of the       future and further signals our commitment to investing in clean, environmentally       safe technology. For additional information regarding anticipated environmental       expenditures, see Managements       Financial Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations under       the       heading entitled Environmental       Matters .
In       the       fourth quarter of 2005, PSO and SWEPCO each issued Requests for Proposals (RFPs)       soliciting capacity and energy resource proposals to satisfy their customers future electric power requirements. SWEPCO is seeking up to 500 MW of short-term       peaking capacity and up to 1,600 MW of long-term generating resources comprised       of peaking, intermediate and baseload generation by 2011. PSO is seeking 300       MW       of short-term peaking resources by June 2008 and 600 of baseload generation       by       June 2011. In December 2005, PSO received four proposals totaling more than       1,100 MW, although one proposal was rejected for not conforming to bidding       requirements. The remaining proposals, which are self-build options, continue       to       be evaluated. SWEPCO and PSO anticipate submitting self-build proposals in       their       respective RFPs processes. PSO received proposals in its base load RFP on       February 16, 2006, totaling 3,500 MW, including three self-build proposals       and       three non-affiliate proposals. The RFPs are currently being       evaluated.

The figures reflect                 construction expenditures, not investments in subsidiary                 companies.
The       System construction program is reviewed continuously and is revised from time       to       time in response to changes in estimates of customer demand, business and       economic conditions, the cost and availability of capital, environmental       requirements and other factors. Changes in construction schedules and costs,       and       in estimates and projections of needs for additional facilities, as well as       variations from currently anticipated levels of net earnings, Federal income       and       other taxes, and other factors affecting cash requirements, may increase or       decrease the estimated capital requirements for the Systems construction       program.
POTENTIAL       UNINSURED LOSSES Some       potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance       carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities,       including liabilities relating to damage to the Cook Plant and costs of       replacement power in the event of a nuclear incident at the Cook Plant. Unless       allowed to be recovered through rates, future losses or liabilities which are       not completely insured could have a material adverse effect on results of       operations and the financial condition of AEP, I&M and other AEP System       companies. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements entitled Commitments       and Contingencies for       information with respect to nuclear incident liability insurance.

CONTROLS       AND PROCEDURES During       2005, management, including the principal executive officer and principal       financial officer of each of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP), AEP       Generating Company, AEP Texas Central Company, AEP Texas North Company,       Appalachian Power Company, Columbus Southern Power Company, Indiana Michigan       Power Company, Kentucky Power Company, Ohio Power Company, Public Service       Company of Oklahoma and Southwestern Electric Power Company (each, together       with       AEP, a Registrant and collectively, together with AEP, the Registrants)       evaluated each respective Registrants disclosure controls and procedures.       Disclosure controls and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures       of the Registrants that are designed to ensure that information required to       be       disclosed by the Registrants in the reports that they file or submit under       the       Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time       periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and       procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to       ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Registrants in the       reports that they file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and       communicated to each Registrants management, including the principal executive       and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions,       as       appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required       disclosure.
As       of       December 31, 2005, these officers concluded that the disclosure controls and       procedures in place are effective and provide reasonable assurance that the       disclosure controls and procedures accomplished their objectives. The       Registrants continually strive to improve their disclosure controls and       procedures to enhance the quality of their financial reporting and to maintain       dynamic systems that change as events warrant.
There       have been no changes in the Registrants internal control over financial       reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the       Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2005 that materially affected, or       are       reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrants internal controls over       financial reporting.
Additional       information required by this item of AEP, as a large accelerated filer, is       incorporated by reference to Managements       Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting ,       included in the 2005 Annual Report.
