iv PART I ITEM 1.BUSINESS GENERAL Overview and Description of Material Subsidiaries AEP was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1906 and reorganized in 1925.

The service areas of AEPs public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  Transmission networks are interconnected with extensive distribution facilities in the territories served.  The public utility subsidiaries of AEP have traditionally provided electric service, consisting of generation, transmission and distribution, on an integrated basis to their retail customers.

short-term debt to finance working capital needs.Short-term debt may also be used to finance acquisitions, construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with long-term debt.In recent history, short-term funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand, borrowing under AEPs revolving credit agreements and AEPs commercial paper program.Funds are made available to subsidiaries under the AEP corporate borrowing program.Certain public utility subsidiaries of AEP also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity.See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Financial Condition for additional information concerning short-term funding and access to bank lines of credit, commercial paper and capital markets.
AEPs revolving credit agreements (which backstop the commercial paper program) include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility, including a maximum debt/capital test.In addition, the acceleration of AEPs payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under these credit agreements.  As of December 31, 2015 , AEP was in compliance with its debt covenants.With the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency, any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before 7 termination of the agreements.A voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of AEP or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event.See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Financial Condition for additional information with respect to AEPs credit agreements.
AEPs subsidiaries have also utilized, and expect to continue to utilize, additional financing arrangements, such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements, including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS General AEP subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities with regard to air and water-quality control and other environmental matters, and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities.The environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the AEP System are outlined below.
Clean Water Act Requirements Operations for AEP subsidiaries are subject to the Federal Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits, and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants.In 2014, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plants cooling water intake screen (impingement) or entrained in the cooling water.The standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day and establish specific intake design and intake velocity standards meant to allow fish to avoid or escape impingement.Compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule.The standard for entrainment for existing facilities requires a site-specific evaluation of the available measures for reducing entrainment.Challenges to this final rule have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and additional changes could be made to this rule as a result of review by the court.
In November 2015, the Federal EPA issued a final rule to update the technology-based standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the Clean Water Acts National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program.For additional information, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues.
Coal Ash Regulation AEPs operations produce a number of different coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash, gypsum and other materials. Effective October 2015, the Federal EPA adopted a rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals, including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal-fired electric generating units.The final rule requires certain standards for location, groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities on a schedule spanning approximately four years after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register.  If existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards, they will be required to close, but the time frame for closure may be extended if adequate alternative disposal options are not available.  For additional information regarding the Federal EPA action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on operations, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Coal Combustion Residual Rule.
Clean Air Act Requirements The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nations air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions.The major CAA programs affecting AEPs power plants are described below.The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements.
8 AEP has made significant long-term investments in environmental controls to reduce air emissions from its power plants. Between 2000 and 2015, AEP invested approximately $8.1 billion in environmental controls, primarily related to CAA, that have significantly reduced emissions.  During the same time period and including our projections through 2017, AEP expects its emissions of mercury to have been reduced by approximately 85%.  Since 1990 and including our projections through 2017, AEP expects its emissions of SO 2 and NO x to have been reduced by approximately 90% and 85% respectively.
The Acid Rain Program The 1990 Amendments to the CAA include a cap-and-trade emission reduction program for SO 2 emissions from power plants.By 2000, the program established a nationwide cap on power plant SO 2 emissions of 8.9 million tons per year and required further reductions in 2010.The 1990 Amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce NO x emissions through the use of available combustion controls.
The success of the SO 2 cap-and-trade program encouraged the Federal EPA and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs.AEP continues to meet its obligations under the Acid Rain Program through the installation of controls, use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets.Subsequent programs developed by the Federal EPA have imposed more stringent SO 2 and NO x emission reduction requirements than the Acid Rain Program on many AEP facilities.Additional controls and other actions have been taken to achieve compliance with these programs at these facilities.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards The CAA requires the Federal EPA to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin.The Federal EPA also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them.These concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).
Each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the NAAQS (attainment areas) and those that do not (nonattainment areas).Each state must develop a state implementation plan (SIP) to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS and maintain good air quality in attainment areas.All SIPs are submitted to the Federal EPA for approval.If a state fails to develop adequate plans, the Federal EPA develops and implements a plan.As the Federal EPA reviews the NAAQS and establishes new concentration levels, the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new SIPs.In 2008, the Federal EPA issued revised NAAQS for both ozone and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ).The PM 2.5 standard was remanded by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and a new rule was signed by the administrator in December 2012 that lowered the annual standard.A new ozone standard was adopted in 2015.The Federal EPA also adopted a new short-term standard for SO 2 in 2010, a lower standard for NO x in 2010, and confirmed the existing standard for lead in 2014.The existing standard for carbon monoxide was retained in 2011.The states are in the process of developing new SIPs for the SO 2 , PM 2.5 and ozone standards, which could result in more stringent emission limitations being imposed on AEP facilities.
In 2005, the Federal EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which required additional reductions in SO 2 and NO x emissions from power plants and assists states developing new SIPs to meet the NAAQS. In August 2011, the Federal EPA issued a final rule to replace CAIR (the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)) that contains more stringent requirements to control SO 2 and NO x emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units in 27 states and the District of Columbia.Petitions for review were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and CSAPR was vacated.That decision was subsequently reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court and remanded back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for further proceedings.  The Federal EPA filed a motion to lift the stay and allow Phase I of CSAPR to take effect on January 1, 2015 and Phase II to take effect on January 1, 2017.  The court granted the Federal EPAs motion, an interim final rule has been issued, and the court has remanded certain state budgets to Federal EPA for further rulemaking while the rule remains in effect.  Federal EPA has proposed more stringent NO x budgets for 23 states during the 2017 ozone season.  For additional information regarding CSAPR, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Clean Air Act Requirements.
9 Hazardous Air Pollutants As a result of the 1990 Amendments to the CAA, the Federal EPA investigated hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to Congress, identifying mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants as warranting further study.In 2011, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for new and existing coal and oil-fired utility units and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for emissions from new and modified power plants.Petitions for review of the MACT standards were denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but in 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court determined that Federal EPA acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from electric generating units.  Federal EPA has issued a supplemental finding and the rule remains in effect.  For additional information regarding MACT, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Clean Air Act Requirements.
Regional Haze The CAA establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas, including national parks, and requires states to submit SIPs that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas (Regional Haze program).In 2005, the Federal EPA issued its Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), detailing how the CAAs best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories, including power plants.
PSO is in the process of implementing a settlement with the Federal EPA in order to comply with the Regional Haze program requirements in Oklahoma.  Federal EPA issued a proposed Federal Implementation Plan for Arkansas in 2015.For additional information regarding CAVR and the Regional Haze program requirements, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Clean Air Act Requirements.
Climate Change AEP has taken action to reduce and offset CO 2 emissions from its generating fleet and expects CO 2 emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coal-fired generation units, and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities.  AEPs total CO 2 emissions in 2015 (not including emissions from the Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek Plants) were approximately 102.4 million metric tons, a  30% reduction from AEPs 2005 CO 2 emissions of approximately 146 million metric tons.  Federal EPA has taken action to regulate CO 2 emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the CAA.For example, the Federal EPA published the Clean Power Plan in October 2015.  Such actions, including the Clean Power Plan, are being legally challenged by numerous parties and final regulatory outcomes remain uncertain.In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay on the final Clean Power Plan, including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans.  The stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court considers any petition for review.
For additional information regarding the Federal EPA action taken to regulate CO 2 emissions, including the Clean Power Plan, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Climate Change, CO 2 Regulation and Energy Policy.
Management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as AEP diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units.The projected decline in coal-fired generation is due to a number of factors, including the ongoing cost of operating older units, the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources, increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals.Managements strategy for this transformation includes diversifying AEPs fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas, increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources, where there is regulatory support.
10 AEPs fossil fuel-fired generating units are large sources of CO 2 emissions.If substantial additional CO 2 emission reductions are required, there will be significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would hasten the ultimate retirement of older, less-efficient, coal-fired units.To the extent additional investments are made to reduce CO 2 emissions and receive regulatory approvals to increase rates, return on capital investment would have a positive effect on future earnings.Prudently incurred capital investments made by AEP subsidiaries in rate-regulated jurisdictions to comply with legal requirements and benefit customers are generally included in rate base for recovery and earn a return on investment.Management would expect these principles to apply to investments made to address new environmental requirements.However, requests for rate increases reflecting these costs can have adverse effects because regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that AEP would recover through higher rates. For sales of energy into competitive markets, however, there is no such recovery mechanism.
Renewable Sources of Energy All of the states AEP serves (other than Kentucky and Tennessee) have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency, alternative energy, or renewable energy sources.
At the end of 2015, the AEP operating companies had long-term contracts for 2,031.5 MW of wind and 10.1 MW of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies customers. In addition, I&M began construction on the first of four solar projects that will make up I&Ms 14.7 MW Clean Energy Solar Pilot Project (CESPP) that was approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.  599 MWs of recently-completed wind projects under contract for PSO were in service as of late 2015, and the remaining three projects associated with I&Ms CESPP projects are expected to begin deliveries in 2016.  This will result in a total of 2,655.3 MW of wind and solar in-service for AEP.  Management actively manages AEPs compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction.
The growth of AEPs renewable portfolio reflects the companys strategy to diversify its generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both energy and capacity needs.  In addition to gradually reducing AEPs reliance on coal-fueled generating units, the growth of renewables and natural gas helps AEP to maintain a diversity of generation resources.
The Clean Power Plan effectively establishes a renewable portfolio standard for each of AEPs states, creating additional opportunities for renewable growth. Independent of the Clean Power Plan, the integrated resource plans filed with state regulatory commissions by AEPs regulated utility subsidiaries reflect AEPs renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers desire for clean energy in a carbon-constrained world.  The Company has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources.  Transmission assets of the AEP System interconnect approximately 7,500 MW of renewable energy resources of third parties, and AEPs transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional renewable energy resources.
End Use Energy Efficiency Beginning in 2008, AEP ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demandthrough the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs. These programs, commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management, were implementedin jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available. Since that time, AEP operating companies have implemented over 100 programs across the AEP service territory and in most of the states AEP serves. For the period 2008 through 2015, these programs have reduced annual consumption by over 6.0 million megawatt hours and peak demand by over 1,500 MW.AEP estimates that its operating companies spent approximately $875 million during that period to achieve these levels.
Energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states AEP serves, and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for AEP operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings. Appropriate recovery of program costs, lost revenues, and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments.The Clean Power Plan  could 11 provide additional opportunities for energy efficiency if states develop implementation plans that require energy efficiency.  AEP believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions the company to be a cost-effective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans.
AEP is also developing and marketing a merchant distributed resource portfolio.  AEPs newly-formed subsidiary, OnSite Partners LLC, works directly with wholesale and large retail customers toprovide tailored solutions based upon market knowledge, technology innovations and deal structuringwhich may include distributed solar, wind, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other forms of cost reducing energy technologies.  OnSite Partners LLC pursues projects where a suitably termed power agreement is entered into with a credit-worthy counterparty.
Corporate Governance In response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of AEPs strategic plan, the Board of Directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements such as the Clean Power Plan that could accelerate the retirement of coal-fired generation assets.  The Board of Directors is informed of any new environmental regulations and proposed regulation or legislation that would affect the company.The Boards Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance oversees the companys annual Corporate Accountability Report, which includes information about the companys environmental, financial and social performance.
Other Environmental Issues and Matters The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites, as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites.See Note 6 to the financial statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, under the heading entitled The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation for further information.
12 Environmental Investments Investments related to improving AEP System plants environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2013, 2014 and 2015 and the current estimate for 2016 are shown below.  AFUDC debt is included in the historical periods.These investments include both environmental as well as other related spending.  Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends and the ability to access capital.AEP expects to make substantial investments in future years in addition to the amounts set forth below in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generation plants for environmental quality controls.Such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2015 or have been proposed and may be adopted.Future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous.  These estimates do not include any projected costs that might be triggered by compliance with the Clean Power Plan.The cost of complying with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules is expected to be material to the AEP System.  AEP typically recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions.For AEPs merchant generation units however, there is no such recovery mechanism.Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEPs financial condition.See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading entitled Environmental Issues and Note 6 to the financial statements, entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general.

Management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with air and water quality standards and other impacts of the environmental proposals.  The following cost estimates for periods following 2016 will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the Federal EPA provides flexibility in the final rules.These cost estimates will also change based on: (a) the states implementation of these regulatory programs, including the potential for state implementation plans (SIPs) or federal implementation plans (FIPs) that impose more stringent standards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions, (c) the actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed on the units, (d) changes in costs for new pollution controls, (e) new generating technology developments, (f) total MWs of capacity retired, replaced or sold, including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and (g) other factors.The following cost estimates do not include any projected costs that might be triggered by compliance with the Clean Power Plan and are limited to only the costs of major projects to comply with existing air and water quality standards.  In addition, management is continuing to evaluate the economic feasibility of environmental investments on both regulated and nonregulated plants.

14 VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITIES GENERAL AEPs vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo.AEPSC, as agent for AEPs public utility subsidiaries, performs marketing, generation dispatch, fuel procurement and power-related risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries.
ELECTRIC GENERATION Facilities As of December 31, 2015 , AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 23,600 MW of domestic generation.See Item 2  Properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries.
Fuel Supply The 2013 results include fuel used and transported by OPCo, a utility subsidiary that is not part of the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment.OPCos results appear here because it retained its generation until year-end 2013 at which point all of its generation was transferred to AGR which transferred portions to APCo and KPCo.
The table shows the generation sources by type, on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Vertically Integrated Utilities: 2015 2014 2013 Coal and Lignite 70% 72% 75% Nuclear 17% 16% 11% Natural Gas 12% 11% 13% Hydroelectric and other 1% 1% <1% A price increase/decrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in the decreased/increased use of other fuels.AEPs overall 2015 fossil fuel costs for the Vertically Integrated Utilities decreased approximately 12% on a dollar per MMBtu basis from 2014.  This was due to a significant decline in natural gas prices along with a marginal decrease in coal prices.
Coal and Lignite AEPs Vertically Integrated Utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-term contracts, affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms.Coal consumption in 2015 decreased from 2014 due to a decrease in power prices and corresponding decrease in demand for coal-fired generation.  As a result, coal inventories ended the year at above-target levels on a system basis.
Management believes that the Vertically Integrated Utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignite-fired units.Through subsidiaries, AEP owns, leases or controls more than 4,838 railcars, approximately 498 barges, 12 towboats, 8 harbor boats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in AEP generating facilities.
Spot market prices for coal continued to decrease throughout 2015.The decreased spot coal prices reflect the reduction in demand for coal-fired generation and the oversupply in the market. As of December 31, 2015, slightly less than half of the coal purchased by AEP was procured through term contracts.As those contracts expire, they are replaced 15 with contracts at current market prices.The price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods.The price paid for coal delivered in 2015 decreased from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in spot coal prices and heavier reliance on shorter term contracts.
The following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities: 2015 2014 2013 Total coal delivered to the plants (millions of tons) 37.3 41.0 51.1 Average cost per ton of coal delivered $ 45.36 $ 46.65 $ 51.31 The coal supplies at  the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal consumption rates, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which may interrupt production or deliveries.  As of December 31, 2015, the Vertically Integrated Utilities coal inventory was approximately 47 days of full load burn.  While inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary, the current coal inventory target for the Vertically Integrated Utilities is approximately 30 days.
Natural Gas The Vertically Integrated Utilities consumed over 89 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2015 for generating power. This represents a decrease of 7% from 2014. While AEPs natural gas-fired generating capacity has increased over the past several years with the addition of the Stall and Dresden units, the implementation of the SPP Market and change in the dispatch of AEPs natural gas fleet resulted in a decreased natural gas-fired generation.Several of AEPs natural gas-fired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability. A portfolio of term, monthly, seasonal, and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas requirements for each plant, as appropriate.  AEPs natural gas supply agreements are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices.
The following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities.  Results for 2013 include natural gas delivered to OPCo, while results for 2015 and 2014 do not.
2015 2014 2013 Total natural gas delivered to the plants (billion cubic feet) 89.7 96.1 158.3 Average price per MMBtu of purchased natural gas $ 2.80 $ 4.70 $ 4.01 Nuclear I&M has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the Cook Plant.I&M has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot, short-term and mid-term markets.I&M also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel.
For purposes of the storage of high-level radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel, I&M completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago.I&M entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations to continue.I&M is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis.I&M completed its initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks in 2012, which consisted of 12 casks (32 spent nuclear fuel assemblies contained within each).The second loading of spent nuclear fuel into dry casks was completed in 2015, which consisted of 16 casks.  The third dry cask loading is expected to occur in 2018.
16 Nuclear Waste and Decommissioning As the owner of the Cook Plant, I&M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely.The cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by NRC regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program.The most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2015.The estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low-level radioactive waste for the Cook Plant was $1.6 billion in 2015 non-discounted dollars.As of December 31, 2015 , the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the Cook Plant was approximately $1.8 billion. The balance of funds available to eventually decommission Cook Plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns.The ultimate cost of retiring the Cook Plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the:  Escalation of various cost elements (including, but not limited to, general inflation and the cost of energy).
Further development of regulatory requirements governing decommissioning.
Technology available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that assumed in studies.
Availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities.
Availability of a United States Department of Energy facility for permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel.
Accordingly, management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the Cook Plant will not be significantly different than current projections.AEP will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections.See Note 6 to the financial statements, entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies under the heading Nuclear Contingencies, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning.
Low-Level Radioactive Waste The Low-Level Waste Policy Act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste rests with the individual states.Low-level radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials.Michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available.I&M cannot predict when such a site may be available. However the states of Utah and Texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from Michigan waste generators.There is currently no set date limiting I&Ms access to either of these facilities.The Cook Plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste.In the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable, then low level radioactive waste can be stored onsite at this facility.
Counterparty Risk Management The Vertically Integrated Utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants.  As a result, counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions.As of December 31, 2015 , counterparties posted approximately $9 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEPSC for the benefit of AEPs public utility subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEPs public utility subsidiaries posted approximately $52 million with counterparties and exchanges).Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily.See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information.
17 Certain Power Agreements I&M The Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and I&M, dated March 31, 1982, provides for the sale by AEGCo to I&M of all the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant.Whether or not power is available from AEGCo, I&M is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by I&M).The agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of Unit 2 of the Rockport Plant have expired (currently December 2022) unless extended in specified circumstances.
Pursuant to an assignment between I&M and KPCo, and a unit power agreement between AEGCo and KPCo, AEGCo sells KPCo 30% of the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo from both units of the Rockport Plant.KPCo has agreed to pay to AEGCo the amounts that I&M would have paid AEGCo under the terms of the Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and I&M for such entitlement.The KPCo unit power agreement expires in December 2022.
OVEC AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC.The aggregate equity participation of AEP in OVEC is 43.47%.Under the Inter-Company Power Agreement, which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each, the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MW) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%.The Inter-Company Power Agreement terminates in June 2040.  The proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC are designed to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital.AEP and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests.OVEC financed capital expenditures totaling $1.3 billion in connection with the engineering and construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plantsthrough debt issuances, including tax-advantaged debt issuances.Both OVEC generation plants are operating with the new environmental controls in service.OPCo attempted to assign its rights and obligations under the Inter-Company Power Agreement to an affiliate as part of its transfer of its generation assets and liabilities in keeping with corporate separation required by Ohio law.OPCo failed to obtain the consent to assignment from the other owners of OVEC and therefore filed a request with the PUCO seeking authorization to maintain its ownership of OVEC. In December 2013, the PUCO approved OPCos request, subject to the condition that energy from the OVEC entitlements are sold into the day-ahead or real-time PJM energy markets, or on a forward basis through a bilateral arrangemen t.  OPCo has filed an application with the PUCO to approve a cost-based purchased power agreement (PPA) rider that would initially be based upon OPCos contractual entitlement under the Inter-Company Agreement which is approximately 20% of OVECs capacity .
ELECTRIC DELIVERY General Other than AEGCo, AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power.See Item 2  Properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines.Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories.These sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances, approved by the FERC.See Item 1. Business  Vertically Integrated Utilities  Regulation  Rates.The FERC regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts.The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, principles, protocols and agreements in place with PJM, SPP and ERCOT, and as approved by the FERC.  See Item 1. Business  Vertically Integrated Utilities  Regulation  FERC.As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to non-affiliated companies.
18 Other than AEGCo, AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory.These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates.In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business.For a discussion of competition in the sale of power, see Item 1. Business  Vertically Integrated Utilities  Competition.
Transmission Agreement APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT and are parties to the TA.OPCo, a subsidiary in AEPs Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment, is also a party to the TA.The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM.The TA has been approved by the FERC.
TCA, OATT, and ERCOT Protocols PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA.Under the TCA, a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of (a) overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement, including the performance of transmission planning studies, (b) the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and (c) compliance with the terms of the OATT filed with the FERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such tariff.Pursuant to the TCA, AEPSC has responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the OATT on behalf of the other parties to the agreement.The TCA also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the OATT.These allocations have been determined by the FERC-approved OATT for the SPP.
Regional Transmission Organizations AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM, and PSO and SWEPCo are members of the SPP (both FERC-approved RTOs).RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not.
REGULATION General AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional cost-based regulation by the state utility commissions.AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions.I&M is subject to regulation by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to the operation of the Cook Plant.AEP and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of EPACT, much of which is administered by the FERC.
Rates Historically, state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service.A utilitys cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes.State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (a) a utilitys adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utilitys level of investment.Absent a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period 19 of time, a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative.Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers.Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time.
Public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service.Provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment, it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery.Given long lead times in construction, the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets, management is actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow.AEP representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process.These options include pre-approvals, a return on construction work in progress, rider/trackers, formula rates and the inclusion of future test-year projections into rates.
The rates of AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service).Historically, the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utilitys rates and tariffs.Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes.
The following state-by-state analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate.Several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction.See Note 4 to the financial statements, entitled Rate Matters, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, for more information regarding pending rate matters.
Indiana I&M provides retail electric service in Indiana at bundled rates approved by the IURC, with rates set on a cost-of-service basis.Indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism.
Oklahoma PSO provides retail electric service in Oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the OCC.PSOs rates are set on a cost-of-service basis.Fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatt-hour sales.The factors are generally adjusted annually and are based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs.Over or under collections of fuel and purchased energy costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the period following when new annual factors are established.
Virginia APCo currently provides retail electric service in Virginia at unbundled rates approved by the Virginia SCC.Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause.Transmission services are provided at OATT rates based on rates established by the FERC.In addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery, APCo is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses.
West Virginia APCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a combined cost-of-service basis.West Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which trues-up to actual expenses.
20 FERC Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale, transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters, including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects.The FERC regulations require AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates.The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers.The FERC also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by (a) approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and (b) granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at market-based rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices. AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have market-based rate authority from the FERC, under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place.The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, to file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utilitys own uses of its transmission system.The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utilitys marketing employees.
The FERC oversees RTOs, entities created to operate, plan and control utility transmission assets.Order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable RTO proposals.AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM.PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP.
The FERC has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of AEPs public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition of securities of utilities, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company.In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system.EPACT gives the FERC increased utility merger oversight.
COMPETITION The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP, like the electric industry generally, face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis, primarily to other public utilities and power marketers.Federal policy generally fosters competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market and mandates that all generators have equal access to transmission services.As a result, there are more generators able to participate in this market.The principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price (including fuel costs), reliability of service, and availability of capacity and power.
Technology advancements, increased demand for clean energy, changing consumer behaviors, low-priced and abundant natural gas, and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries.  AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries also compete with self-generation and with distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas.The primary factors in such competition are price, reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power.  With respect to competing generators and self-generation, the public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that they currently maintain a competitive position.
Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production.The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEPs competitiveness.
21 While the adoption rate of distributed generation in AEPs service areas has not reached the levels seen in other parts of the country, AEPs vertically integrated utility companies are focused on providing customers with more choices by working with regulators and policymakers to expand, and potentially accelerate, renewable energy offerings.  Such additional customer choices consider not only long-term cost, but are also focused on expanding resource diversity.  This includes proposed new revenue structures that enable deployment of advanced technologies and resources. In 2015, AEP formed an Enterprise Technology Council to develop and deploy new programs and services designed to receive regulatory support.  The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that the reliability of their service, the limited ability of customers to substitute other economical sources for electric power and their ability to cost-effectively deploy advanced technologies, such as solar, on a large scale place them in a favorable competitive position.
In the event that alternative generation resources are mandated , subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity.  This occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output. These events could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.If AEP retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.AEP typically recovers undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.
Recent changes in the global economy have led to increased competition for many industrial customers in the United States, including those served by the AEP System.  Industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs, which may include, among other things, the cost of electric power.The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP work with such customers to meet their business needs through, for example, providing various off-peak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with, and approved by, the various state commissions.  The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP also work with customers that seek to source more of their electric power from renewable resources.  Depending on the jurisdiction, customers may have access to green power tariffs.  In other instances, AEP purchases renewable power that is available to all customers in a specific jurisdiction.
SEASONALITY The sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business.In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEPs facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which AEP enters.In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEPs results of operations and may impact its financial condition.Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEPs results of operations.
22 TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES GENERAL This segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by OPCo, TCC and TNC. OPCo is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1,468,000 retail customers in Ohio.TCC is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 826,000 retail customers through REPs in southern Texas. TNC is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 189,000 retail customers through REPs in west and central Texas.
AEPs transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power.See Item 2  Properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines.Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEPs transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories.These sales are made at rates approved by the PUCT for TCC and TNC and by the PUCO and the FERC for OPCo.The FERC regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions.As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to non-affiliated companies.
AEPs transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service.These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates.In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business.
The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and ERCOT, and as approved by the FERC.In addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas, AEPs transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries through RTOs also provide transmission services for non-affiliated companies.
Transmission Agreement OPCo, together with APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo, is a party to the TA.The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the cost of their transmission facilities.The TA has been approved by the FERC.
Regional Transmission Organizations OPCo is a member of PJM, a FERC-approved RTO.RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not.TCC and TNC are members of ERCOT.
REGULATION OPCo provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at cost-based rates approved by the PUCO or by the FERC.TCC and TNC provide transmission and distribution service on a cost-of-service basis at rates approved by the PUCT and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the FERC consistent with PUCT rules.Transmission and distribution rates are established on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service.The cost of service generally reflects operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes.Utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (a) a utilitys adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utilitys level of investment.
23 FERC Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC regulates rates for transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters.The FERC regulations require AEP to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates.The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers.The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utilitys own uses of its transmission system.The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utilitys marketing employees. In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system.EPACT gives the FERC increased utility merger oversight.
SEASONALITY The delivery of electric power is generally a seasonal business.In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months.In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter months.The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEPs transmission and distribution facilities.In addition, AEP transmission and distribution has historically delivered less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP transmission and distributions results of operations and may impact its financial condition.Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP transmission and distributions results of operations.
AEP TRANSMISSION HOLDCO (AEPTHCO) GENERAL AEPTHCo is a holding company for (a) AEPTCo, which is the direct holding company for the seven wholly-owned FERC-regulated transmission-only electric utilities (Transcos) listed below, each of which is geographically aligned with AEPs existing utility operating companies and (b) AEPs transmission joint ventures.
AEPTCo TRANSCOS AEP East Transmission Companies (the AEP East Transmission Companies, all located within PJM)  AEP Appalachian Transmission Company, Inc. (APTCo)  AEP Indiana Michigan Transmission Company, Inc. (IMTCo)  AEP Kentucky Transmission Company, Inc. (KTCo)  AEP Ohio Transmission Company, Inc. (OHTCo)  AEP West Virginia Transmission Company, Inc. (WVTCo) AEP West Transmission Companies (the AEP West Transmission Companies, all located within SPP)  AEP Oklahoma Transmission Company, Inc. (OKTCo)  AEP Southwestern Transmission Company, Inc. (SWTCo) (covering Louisiana) Transmission development through the Transcos is primarily driven by:  Improvements to local area reliability by upgrading, rebuilding or replacing existing, aging infrastructure.
Construction of new facilities to support customer points of delivery, generation interconnections, new facilities to provide transmission service directed by the RTOs, and new facilities required to maintain grid reliability.
24  Projects assigned as a result of the regional planning initiatives conducted by PJM and SPP.PJM and SPP identify the need for transmission in support of regional reliability, congestion reduction and the integration of and retirement of generation facilities.
The Transcos develop, own and operate transmission assets that are physically connected to AEPs existing system.They are regulated for rate-making purposes exclusively by the FERC and employ a forward-looking formula rate tariff design.The Transcos are independent of, but overlay AEPs existing vertically integrated utility operating companies and the transmission operations of OPCo.IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo, OKTCo and WVTCo have received approvals for formation or did not require state commission approval to operate.IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo, OKTCo and WVTCo currently own and operate transmission assets.An application for regulatory approval for SWTCo is under consideration in Louisiana.  As of December 31, 2015, AEPTCos subsidiaries had $2.8 billion of transmission assets in-service with plans to construct approximately $3.5 billion of additional transmission assets through 2018.
25 AEPTHCo JOINT VENTURE INITIATIVES AEP has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing, building, and owning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in North America.
AEP is currently participating in the following joint venture initiatives: Joint Venture Name Location Projected or Actual Completion Date Owners (Ownership %) Total Estimated Project Costs at Completion AEP's Investment as of December31, 2015 (i) Approved Return on Equity (in millions) ETT Texas (a) Berkshire Hathaway $ 3,528.0 (a) $ 572.0 9.96 % (ERCOT) Energy (50%) AEP (50%) Prairie Wind Kansas 2014 Westar Energy (50%) 158.0 20.6 12.8 % Berkshire Hathaway Energy (25%) AEP (25%) (b) Pioneer Indiana 2018 (c) Duke Energy (50%) 1,100.0 (c) 16.9 12.54 % AEP (50%) RITELine IN Indiana 2026 Exelon (12.5%) 400.0 0.1 (e) 11.43 % AEP (87.5%) (d) RITELine IL Illinois 2026 Commonwealth 1,200.0  (e) 11.43 % Edison (75%) Exelon (12.5%) AEP (12.5%) (d) Transource Missouri 2016 Great Plains Energy 331.0 81.3 11.1 % (g) Missouri (13.5%) AEP (86.5%) (f) Transource West 2019 Great Plains Energy 60.0   (h) West Virginia Virginia (13.5%) (f) AEP (86.5%) (f) (a) ETT is undertaking multiple projects and the completion dates will vary for those projects.

(e) RITELine IN is a consolidated variable interest entity.RTD received an order from the FERC in October 2011 granting incentives for the RITELine IN and RITELine IL projects.The projects and other segments that are electrically equivalent in nature will continue to be submitted for consideration in the interregional planning process between PJM and MISO as dictated by emerging system needs.
(f) AEP owns 86.5% of Transource Missouri and Transource West Virginia through its ownership interest in Transource Energy, LLC (Transource).Transource is a joint venture with AEPTHCo and Great Plains Energy formed to pursue competitive transmission projects.AEPTHCo and Great Plains Energy own 86.5% and 13.5% of Transource, respectively.
(g) The ROE represents the weighted average approved return on equity based on the projected costs of two projects currently under development by Transource Missouri:the $65 million Iatan-Nashua project (10.3%) and the $266 million Sibley-Nebraska City project (11.3%).
(h) An application for recovery has been filed and a settlement is pending which calls for 10% Base ROE, together with a 0.50% rider, for Transource West Virginias 15 mile 138kV line Thorofare project.
(i) RITELine IN, Transource Missouri and Transource West Virginia are consolidated joint ventures by AEP.Therefore, the investment value listed reflects applicable income taxes that are the responsibility of AEP.All other investments in this schedule are joint ventures that are not consolidated by AEP.Therefore, these investment values listed do not reflect income taxes that are the responsibility of AEP.
AEPs joint ventures do not have employees.Business services for the joint ventures are provided by AEPSC and other AEP subsidiaries and the joint venture partners.  During 2015 approximately 521 AEPSC employees and 253 operating company employees provided service to one or more joint ventures.
26 REGULATION The Transcos and joint ventures located outside of ERCOT establish transmission rates annually through forward looking formula rate filings with the FERC pursuant to FERC-approved implementation protocols.The protocols include a transparent, formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudently incurred and reasonably calculated.
The Transcos and joint ventures (where applicable) rates are included in the respective OATT for PJM and SPP.An OATT is the FERC rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission providers transmission system.The FERC requires transmission providers such as PJM and SPP to offer transmission service to all eligible customers (for example, load-serving entities, power marketers, generators and customers) on a non-discriminatory basis.
The FERC-approved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement (ATRR) and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with FERC.The formula rates establish rates for a one-year period based on the current projects in-service and proposed projects for a defined timeframe.The formula rates also include a true-up calculation for the previous years billings, allowing for over/under-recovery of the transmission owners ATRR.PJM and SPP pay the transmission owners their ATRR for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the PJM and SPP OATTs, based on the terms and conditions in the respective OATT for the service taken.
The formula rate mechanism allows for a return on equity of 11.49% based on a capital structure of up to 50% equity for the AEP East Transmission Companies.The AEP West Transmission Companies are allowed a return on equity of 11.2% based on a capital structure of up to 50% equity. The authorized returns on equity for the Transcos are commensurate with the FERC-authorized returns on equity in the PJM and SPP OATTs, respectively, for AEPs utility subsidiaries.
In the annual rate base filings described above, the Transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of $2.3 billion in 2015, $1.4 billion for 2014 and $776 million for 2013.The total transmission revenue requirement filed in the ATRR, including prior year over/under-recovery of revenue and associated carrying charges, for 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $363 million, $231 million, $107 million and $34 million, respectively.
The rates of ETT, which is located in ERCOT, are determined by the PUCT.ETT sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim Transmission Costs of Services (TCOS) filings.ETT may file interim TCOS filings semi-annually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital.
In November 2015, the PUCT ordered ETT to file a base rate case by February 2017.  A base rate review could produce a refund if ETT incurs a disallowance of the transmission investment on which an interim TCOS increase was based.  A refund of interim transmission rates would reduce future net income and cash flows.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring.
See Note 4 to the financial statements, entitled Rate Matters, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, for more information regarding pending rate matters.
AEPs joint ventures have approved returns on equity ranging from 9.96% to 12.8% based on equity capital structures ranging from 40% to 60%.
COMPETITION One of the most significant provisions of FERC Order No. 1000 is the removal of the federal right of first refusal for incumbent utilities within tariffs and agreements for certain regional transmission projects. Historically, vertically integrated public utilities had the right to build and own transmission lines proposed by the regions planning processes when those lines connected to facilities within their respective retail service territories.FERC Order No. 1000 eliminates the federal right of first refusal in RTO tariffs for incumbent utilities to construct certain regional transmission projects within their own service territories, thereby creating the opportunity for any qualified entity to build and own regional transmission facilities in any service territory.Transource was created to respond to FERC Order No. 1000 competitive processes at the RTO level.
27 GENERATION & MARKETING GENERAL The AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries consist of competitive nonutility generating assets, a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business.The largest subsidiary in the Generation & Marketing segment is AGR.AGR owns 6,752 MW of generating capacity, with rights to an additional 1,186 MW pursuant to a unit power agreement (see below).Other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets.See Item 2  Properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the Generation & Marketing segment. AGR is a competitive generation subsidiary.
With respect to wholesale energy trading and marketing business, AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries enter into short and long-term transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in ERCOT, SPP, MISO and PJM.These subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities.
These activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity (and to a lesser extent, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances) under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices.These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, over-the-counter swaps and options.The majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts.These transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges.
With respect to the retail supply and energy management business, AEPs subsidiary AEP Energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial customers.AEP Energy provides an array of energy solutions and is operating in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio and Washington, D.C.AEP Energy also provides demand-side management solutions nationwide.AEP Energy had approximately 375,000 customer accounts as of December 31, 2015 .
REGULATION AGR is a public utility under the Federal Power Act, and is subject to FERCs exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for sales of energy, capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable.FERC granted AGR market-based rate authority in December 2013.FERCs jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of utilities (including AGR, which is a public utility as defined by the FERC) and set cost-based rates if FERC subsequently determines that such utility can exercise market power, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.As a condition to the order granting AGR market-based rate authority, every three years AGR is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet FERCs standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for market-based rates.Other matters subject to FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, review of mergers, and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility.
Specific operations of AGR are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies, including Federal and state environmental protection agencies.AGR is also regulated by the PUCT for transactions inside ERCOT. Additionally, AGR is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, with the approval of FERC.
COMPETITION The AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power, capacity and ancillary services.The principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation. Because much of AGRs 28 generation is coal-fired, lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation. Other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation, transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities, inoperability or inefficiencies, outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities.
Technology advancements, increased demand for clean energy, changing consumer behaviors, low-priced and abundant natural gas, and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for AEPs Generation & Marketing segment.  AGR also competes with self-generation and with distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas.The primary factors in such competition are price, unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power.
Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production.The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AGRs competitiveness.  The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive.
While the adoption rate of distributed generation in areas that AGR sells power has not reached the levels seen in other parts of the country, AEP expects these trends to continue.  AGR believes that the unit availability, the limited ability of customers to substitute other economical sources for electric power and its ability to cost-effectively deploy advanced technologies, such as solar, on a large scale place it in a favorable competitive position.
In the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity. This occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output. These events could cause AGR to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life. If AGR retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that AGR will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants and may be forced to shut down competitive units.
Recent changes in the global economy have led to increased competition for many industrial customers in the United States, including those served by the Generation & Marketing segment.  Industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs, which may include, among other things, the cost of electric power.The Generation & Marketing segment works with such customers to meet their business needs through, for example, providing various off-peak or interruptible supply options.  The Generation & Marketing segment also works with customers that seek to source more of their electric power from renewable resources.
SEASONALITY The sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business.In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter months.The pattern of this fluctuation may change.
Fuel Supply The table shows the generation sources by type, on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Generation and Marketing segment, not including the Oklaunion generating unit: 2015 2014 Coal 75% 88% Natural Gas 25% 12% Fuel Oil and other <   1% <   1% 29 A price increase/decrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in the decreased/increased use of other fuels.
Coal and Consumables AGR procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-term and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms.As contracts expire, they are replaced, as needed, with contracts at market prices. Coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements.
Management believes that AGR will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal fired units.AGR, through its contracts with third party transporters, has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facilities.  AGR plants consumed 11.2 million tons of coal in 2015.
The coal supplies at AGR plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal consumption rates, coal quality, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which may interrupt production or deliveries.  AGR likes to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plants in the range of 15 to 40 days of full load burn. As of December 31, 2015, the coal inventory of AGR was approximately 57 days of full load burn.
Natural Gas Despite the availability of natural gas due to the increased shale supply, the U.S. pipeline infrastructure remains a limiting factor in the expansion of natural gas-fired generation.A portfolio of term, monthly, seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements (that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices) supplies natural gas requirements for each plant, as appropriate.  AGR plants consumed 86 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2015, an increase of approximately 73% from 2014.
Counterparty Risk Management Counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions.As of December 31, 2015 , counterparties posted approximately $26 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEP for the benefit of AEPs Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEPs Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately $225 million with counterparties and exchanges).Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily.See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information.
Certain Power Agreements AEGCo The Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and AGR (assigned from OPCo) dated March 15, 2007, provides for the sale by AEGCo to AGR of all the capacity and associated unit contingent energy and ancillary services available to AGR from the Lawrenceburg Plant, a 1,186 MW natural gas-fired unit owned by AEGCo.AGR is obligated to pay a capacity charge (whether or not power is available from the Lawrenceburg Plant), and the fuel, operating and maintenance charges associated with the energy dispatched by AGR, and to reimburse AEGCo for other costs associated with the operation and ownership of the Lawrenceburg Plant.The agreement will continue in effect until December 31, 2017 unless extended.
30 OPCo Pursuant to a Power Supply Agreement (PSA) between AGR and OPCo, AGR supplied capacity for OPCos switched and non-switched retail load for the period January 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015.
Other As of December 31, 2015 , the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 310 MW of company-owned domestic wind power facilities, 177 MW of domestic wind power from long-term purchase power agreements and 355 MW of coal-fired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers TNCs interest in the Oklaunion power station to AEP Energy Partners, Inc.The power obtained from the Oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ERCOT.
AEP RIVER OPERATIONS Prior to its sale in November 2015, AEP River Operations segment transported liquid, coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the Ohio, Illinois and lower Mississippi rivers.As a result of the sale, AEP River Operations is no longer a business segment.

32 ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS In addition to other disclosures within this report, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be considered in evaluating the Registrants.  Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought.  As indicated below, many of the following risk factors apply to AEP and several or all of the Registrant Subsidiaries and, accordingly, such risk factors should be read to include the applicable Registrants.
GENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONS AEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants) AEPs business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction of additional transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives.AEPs public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their planned extensive investment.This would cause financial results to be diminished.
Regulated electric revenues, earnings and results are dependent on state regulation that may limit AEPs ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants) The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Ohio, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Indiana, Louisiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, Michigan and Tennessee. If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings. Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted. Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost, including fuel and related costs, generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved.
AEPs transmission investment strategy and execution bears certain risks associated with these activities. (Applies to all Registrants) Management expects that a growing portion of AEPs earnings in the future will be derived from the transmission investments and activities of AEPTCo and transmission joint ventures.FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.If FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEPs strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted.Management believes AEPs experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.If the FERC were to lower the rate of return it has authorized for AEPs transmission investments and facilities, or if one or more states were to successfully limit FERC jurisdiction on recovery of costs on transmission investment and its return, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
33 AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants) AEPs business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP and its subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.
AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M) Through I&M, AEP owns the Cook Plant.It consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,191 MW, or about 7% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:  The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear fuel.
Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations.
Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the losses of others).
Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.
There can be no assurance that I&Ms preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered.
The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants.In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition.A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.
Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.
34 The different regional power markets in which AEP subsidiaries compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures, which could affect performance in these regions. (Applies to all Registrants) Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.The rules governing the various regional power markets, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues.Because the manner in which RTOs will evolve remains unclear, management is unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on the business.
AEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants) As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.
RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKS AEPs financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants) Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities.Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:  Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.
Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.
Labor disputes.
Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.
Information technology failure that impairs AEPs information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.
Information technology failure that affects AEPs ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEPs reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims.
Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors.
Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.
Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.
Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEPs reputation.
(Applies to all Registrants) AEP owns assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run AEP facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view AEPs computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber attack.In addition, the business requires that AEP collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.
35 A successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEPs reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, AEP has a comprehensive cyber security program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems. In addition, AEP is subject to mandatory cyber security regulatory requirements. However, cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt, and, as a result, there is a risk that AEP could experience a successful cyber attack despite current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts.
If AEP is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants) AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.Volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEPs ability to raise capital and fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.In addition, certain sources of debt and equity capital gave expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels.  If sources of capital for AEP disappear, capital costs could increase materially.Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
Downgrades in AEPs credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital and/or to operate the power trading businesses. (Applies to all Registrants) The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEPs capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings.Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations.AEPs business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive.In periods of market turmoil, access to capital is difficult for all borrowers.If AEPs ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEPs interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
AEPs power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of AEPs individual public utility subsidiaries senior unsecured long-term debt or on the investment grade ratings of AEP.Most counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions.If those ratings were to decline below investment grade, AEPs ability to operate the power trading business profitably would be diminished because AEP would likely have to deposit cash or cash-related instruments which would reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
AEP has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP) AEP is a holding company and has no operations of its own.Its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries, primarily its regulated utilities, and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from, AEP.Its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP) to provide AEP with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.Payments to AEP by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.AEP indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.
36 AEPs operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants) Electric power generation is generally a seasonal business.In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that AEP enters into.In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEPs results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.
Further, deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants) Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business.If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.
Changes in the price of commodities, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEPs cost of producing power or decrease the amount received from selling power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants) AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal.AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts.Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of coal used as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.As long as current environmental programs remain in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond.If the Federal EPA is able to create a replacement rule to reduce interstate transport, and it is acceptable by the courts, additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.If AEP needs to obtain allowances under a replacement rule, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.AEPs risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.
AEP also owns natural gas-fired facilities which exposes AEP to market prices of natural gas.Historically, natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources. Recently however, the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened price volatility.  AEPs ability to make sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas.As the price of natural gas falls, other market participants that utilize natural gas-fired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to AEPs sales prices, so the margins realized from sales will be lower and, on occasion, AEP may need to curtail operation of marginal plants.Management expects the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility will have a long-term material effect on the price and volatility of natural gas.
37 Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past.Changes in the cost of coal, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.As a result, as those transactions are marked to market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.
AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants) Climate change creates physical and financial risk.Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events.Customers energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.
Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues.Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues.AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEPs own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEPs own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.
Severe weather impacts AEPs service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and snow or ice storms occur.To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase AEPs cost of providing service.Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally the fossil fuel generating units.A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEPs ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.
To the extent climate change impacts a regions economic health, it may also impact revenues.AEPs financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves.The price of energy, as a factor in a regions cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the AEP System.
Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEPs business activities. (Applies to all Registrants) AEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
38 RISKS RELATING TO STATE RESTRUCTURING Collection of revenues in Texas is concentrated in a limited number of REPs. (Applies to AEP) Revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ERCOT area of Texas are collected from REPs that supply the electricity AEP distributes to REP customers.Currently, AEP does business with approximately one hundred REPs.In 2015, TCCs largest REP accounted for 23% of its operating revenue and its second largest REP accounted for 22% of its operating revenue; TNCs largest REP accounted for 11% of its operating revenues, and its second largest REP accounted for 10% of its operating revenues.Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the Texas market or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for services or cause them to delay such payments.AEP depends on these REPs for timely remittance of payments.Any delay or default in payment could reduce future cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWER Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants) Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.Approximately 90% of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.Compliance with these legal requirements requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and permits at all AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.These expenditures have been significant in the past, and management expects that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations.Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated.If AEP retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.For AEPs merchant generation units, there is no such cost-recovery mechanism.As a result, AEP may not recover costs through the market and may be forced to shut competitive units down.The costs of compliance for AEPs competitive units could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.
Regulation of CO 2 emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants) In 2015, the Federal EPA issued final CO 2 emissions standards for new power generation sources, and final emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel fired electric generating units.The standards for new coal-fired generating units are based on the use of partial carbon capture and storage.  The standards for natural gas combined cycle units are based on the use of efficient combined cycle generating technology. The Clean Power Plan guidelines for existing sources include aggressive emission rate goals that are composed of a number of measures and seek nationwide reductions of CO 2 emissions of approximately 32% from 2005 levels by 2030.  The Clean Power Plan is intended to be implemented pursuant to individual state plans beginning in 2022.  In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay on the final Clean Power Plan, including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans.  The stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court considers any petition for review.
All of the final requirements are currently the subject of litigation in the federal courts.
39 CO 2 standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.If AEP retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.For AEPs merchant generation units, there is no such cost-recovery mechanism.As a result, AEP may not recover costs through the market and may be forced to shut competitive units down.The costs of compliance for AEPs competitive units could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.
AEPs financial performance  may be adversely affected if the merchant generation fleet is not profitable or loses value. (Applies to AEP) Management is evaluating strategic alternatives for AEPs merchant generation fleet, which primarily includes AGRs generation fleet which operates in PJM.  Management has not made a decision regarding the potential alternatives, nor have they set a specific timeframe for a decision. Certain of these alternatives could result in a loss which could reduce future net income and cash flow and harm financial condition.
Amounts AEP receives from the results of PJM capacity auctions associated with nonregulated generation assets could fail to adequately compensate AEP. (Applies to AEP) Financial returns on AGRs generation capacity are subject to the results of annual PJM capacity auctions.Auction results indicate a great deal of volatility and the possibility of clearing prices substantially lower than the cost of such capacity.If the PJM capacity auctions result in clearing prices lower than the cost of AEPs capacity, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.
Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants) In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants.In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants power plants constitute a public nuisance.The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications of AEPs existing coal-fired power plants could be required and AEP might be required to limit or reduce emissions.Such remedies could require AEP to purchase power from third parties to fulfill AEPs commitments to supply power to AEP customers.This could have a material impact on costs.In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.While management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in AEP jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis, without such recovery, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.
Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of generating facilities. (Applies to all Registrants) AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities.  This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than (a) newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and (b) distributed generation using either new or existing technology. Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it.  Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production.The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEPs competitiveness.  The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive.  It is possible that advances in technologies, the availability of distributed generation or changes in 40 regulatory policies will lower the demand for electricity or reduce the costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production, either of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.
Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity. This occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output. These events could adversely affect AEPs financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and could also result in an impairment of certain long-lived assets.
Profitability is impacted by AEPs continued authorization to sell power at market-based rates. (Applies to all Registrants) FERC has granted AGR, APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. FERC reserves the right to revoke or revise this market-based rate authority if it subsequently determines that one or more of these companies can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.Each company that has obtained market-based rate authority from FERC must file a market power update every three years to show that they continue to meet FERCs standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether entities qualify for market-based rates.The loss of market-based rate authority by any of these entities, especially by AGR, could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.
Revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond AEPs control. (Applies to all Registrants) AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations.With respect to such transactions, the rate of return on capital investments is not determined through mandated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power in regional markets and competitive markets.These market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time.Sales margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline.In addition, the FERC, which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates, as well as RTOs that oversee some of these markets, may impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.Power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the FERC.Fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile, and the price AEP can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel and/or emissions costs.These factors could reduce margins and therefore diminish revenues and results of operations.Volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from:  Weather conditions, including storms.
Economic conditions.
Outages of major generation or transmission facilities.
Seasonality.
Power usage.
Illiquid markets.
Transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies.
Availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources.
Demand for energy commodities.
Natural gas, crude oil and refined products and coal production levels.
Natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events.
Federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation and/or incentives.
RTO market structures.
41 Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants) The exposure of AEPs power trading activities is managed by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures.  These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities.As a result, management cannot predict the impact that AEPs energy trading and risk management decisions may have on AEPs business, operating results or financial position.
AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEPs trading portfolio.To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position.
AEPs power trading risk management activities, including power sales agreements with counterparties, rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities.These factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made.Even when policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates, results of operations may be impacted if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate.
AEPs power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements.To the extent that AEPs power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, through long-term power purchase agreements, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.
In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, over-the counter options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements.If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.
Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEPs results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants) AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or power could breach their obligations.Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEPs contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses.Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.
AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control.If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEPs power. (Applies to all Registrants) AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale.This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks.If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power.If a regions power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEPs recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.
The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.

AEP Transmission Holdco Segment The following table sets forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission lines of certain wholly-owned and joint venture-owned entities: Total Overhead Circuit Miles of Transmission Lines ETT 1,544 IMTCo 62 OHTCo 310 OKTCo 256 Prairie Wind 216 Total Circuit Miles 2,388 TITLE TO PROPERTY The AEP Systems generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple.The greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the AEP System has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority.The rights of AEPs public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business.Minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist, but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties.AEPs public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them, if necessary, to acquire, perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations.Legislation in Ohio and Virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes.
SYSTEM TRANSMISSION LINES AND FACILITY SITING Laws in the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities and/or routes of high-voltage transmission lines.AEP has experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which AEPs operating companies have sought to acquire rights-of-way through condemnation.These proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years.
CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM With input from its state utility commissions, the AEP System continuously assesses the adequacy of its generation, transmission, distribution and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers.In this assessment process, assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified, as appropriate.AEP forecasts approximately $5 billion of construction expenditures for 2016 .  Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business 47 opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, weather and the ability to access capital.For additional information on AEPs construction program, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Budgeted Construction Expenditures.
POTENTIAL UNINSURED LOSSES Some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities, including liabilities relating to damage to AEPs generation plants and costs of replacement power.Unless allowed to be recovered through rates, future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured could reduce net income and impact the financial conditions of AEP and other AEP System companies.For risks related to owning a nuclear generating unit, see Note 6 to the financial statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies under the heading Nuclear Contingencies for information with respect to nuclear incident liability insurance.
ITEM 3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For a discussion of material legal proceedings, see Note 6 to the financial statements, entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, incorporated by reference in Item 8.
ITEM 4.MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) imposes stringent health and safety standards on various mining operations.The Mine Act and its related regulations affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, equipment used in mine emergency procedures, mine plans and other matters.SWEPCo, through its ownership of Dolet Hills Lignite Company, LLC (DHLC), and AGR and KPCo, through their interest in the Conner Run fly ash impoundment, are subject to the provisions of the Mine Act.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder require companies that operate mines to include in their periodic reports filed with the SEC, certain mine safety information covered by the Mine Act.Exhibit 95 Mine Safety Disclosure Exhibit contains the notices of violation and proposed assessments received by DHLC and Conner Run under the Mine Act for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 .
