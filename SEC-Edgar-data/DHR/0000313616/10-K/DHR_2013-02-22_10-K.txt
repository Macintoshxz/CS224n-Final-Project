PART I ITEM1.
BUSINESS General We derive our sales from the design, manufacture and marketing of professional, medical, industrial and consumer products, which are typically characterized by strong brand names, proprietary technology and major market positions. Our business consists of four segments: Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies, Industrial Technologies, and Tools& Components.
We strive to create shareholder value through:  delivering sales growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for our products and services;  upper quartile financial performance compared to our peer companies; and  upper quartile cash flow generation from operations compared to our peer companies.
To accomplish these goals, we use a set of tools and processes, known as the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM (DBS), which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. Within the DBS framework, we also pursue a number of ongoing strategic initiatives intended to improve our operational performance, including global sourcing of materials and services and innovative product development. We also acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve the objectives described above, and believe that many acquisition opportunities remain available within our target markets. We will acquire businesses when they strategically fit with existing operations or when they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic line of business. The extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and effectively integrated can affect our overall growth and operating results. We also continually assesses the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are not deemed to strategically fit with our ongoing operations or are not achieving the desired return on investment.
3 Table of Contents Danaher Corporation, originally DMG, Inc., was organized in 1969 as a Massachusetts real estate investment trust. In 1978 it was reorganized as a Florida corporation under the name Diversified Mortgage Investors, Inc. (DMI) which in a second reorganization in 1980 became a subsidiary of a newly created holding company named DMG, Inc. We adopted the name Danaher in 1984 and were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation following the 1986 annual meeting of our shareholders.

************************************ The following discussions of Materials, Intellectual Property, Competition, Seasonal Nature of Business, Backlog, Employee Relations, Research and Development, Government Contracts, Regulatory Matters, International Operations, Major Customers and Other Matters include information common to all of our segments.
Materials Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, copper, cast iron, electronic components, aluminum, plastics and other petroleum-based products. We purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world. No single supplier is material, although for some of the components that we use that require particular specifications there may be a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components. There have been no raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business as a whole. Market forces have driven significant increases in the costs of steel and petroleum-based products over the last three years, and the costs of non-ferrous metals have also generally increased over the last eighteen months. We have passed certain of these cost increases on to customers in the form of price increases. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
9 Table of Contents Intellectual Property We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations, we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole. From time to time, however, we do engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property. For a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. All capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, Danaher or its subsidiaries.
Competition Although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as we do. Because of the diversity of the products we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, including well-established regional or specialized competitors, as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies that have greater sales, marketing, research, and financial resources than we do. The number of competitors varies by product line. Our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets served. Key competitive factors typically include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business, as well as price, quality, delivery speed, service and support, innovation, distribution network, and brand name. For a discussion of risks related to competition, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Seasonal Nature of Business General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results, and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end-markets that they serve. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months, medical and capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter, sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products, and sales to the United States government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter. However, as a whole, we are not subject to material seasonality.
Working Capital We maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items.
Backlog The table below provides the unfulfilled orders attributable to each of our four segments as of the end of each year ($ in millions): AsofDecember31 Segment 2007 2006 Professional Instrumentation $ 597 $ 252 Medical Technologies 235 192 Industrial Technologies 811 719 Tools& Components 66 65 We expect that a large majority of unfilled orders will be delivered to customers within 3 to 4 months. Given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles, we believe that backlog is indicative of short-term revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term performance.
10 Table of Contents Employee Relations At December31, 2007, we employed approximately 50,000 persons, of which approximately 24,000 were employed in the United States. Of these United States employees, approximately 2,500 were hourly-rated unionized employees. We also have government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements or union contracts in other countries. Though we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory, we are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes.
Research and Development The table below describes our research and development expenditures over each of the last three years, by segment and in the aggregate ($ in millions): FortheYearsEndedDecember31 Segment 2007 2006 2005 Professional Instrumentation ** $ 272 $ 174 $ 157 Medical Technologies 168 123 75 Industrial Technologies 150 133 130 Tools& Components 11 10 12 Total $ 601 $ 440 $ 374 ** Included in 2007 research and development expenses for the Professional Instrumentation segment is a charge for $60 million related to acquired in-process research and development in connection with the Tektronix acquisition.
We conduct research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products, enhancing the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of our existing products and expanding the applications for which uses of our products are appropriate. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position. For a discussion of the risks related to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Government Contracts Although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2007 was from customers other than governmental entities, we have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities, primarily involving products in the aerospace and defense, product identification, water quality and motion businesses. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs. Our failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts, criminal or civil sanctions, administrative penalties or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. For a further discussion of risks related to compliance with government contracting requirements, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
11 Table of Contents Regulatory Matters Environmental, Health& Safety Certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the United States and abroad in connection with our operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and, based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. For a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
In addition to environmental compliance costs, we from time to time incur costs related to alleged damages associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. For example, generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist, as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and from state and non-U.S. environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous wastes require clean-up and other possible remedial action, including sites where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations. We have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities, in both the United States and abroad, to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances.
We have made a provision for environmental remediation and environmental-related personal injury claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the Company and its subsidiaries. We generally make an assessment of the costs involved for our remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as our prior experience with similar sites. If the Company determines that potential remediation liability for properties currently or previously owned is probable and reasonably estimable, it accrues the total estimated costs, including investigation and remediation costs, associated with the site. We also estimate our exposure for environmental-related personal injury claims and accrue for this estimated liability as such claims become known. While we actively pursue insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties, we do not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realization is deemed probable and reasonably estimable. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of our involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations. As such, we cannot assure you that our estimates of environmental liabilities will not change.
In view of our financial position and reserves for environmental remediation matters and environmental-related personal injury claims and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, we believe that our liability related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. For a discussion of risks related to past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Medical Devices Certain of our products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) and by the counterpart agencies of the non-U.S. countries where our products are sold. Some of the regulatory requirements of these foreign countries are different than those applicable in the United States.
12 Table of Contents Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA), the FDA regulates virtually all phases of the manufacture, sale, and distribution of medical devices, including their introduction into interstate commerce, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution and record keeping. Pursuant to the FDCA and FDA regulations, certain facilities of our operating subsidiaries are registered with the FDA as medical device manufacturing establishments. The FDA, as well as our ISO Notified Bodies, regularly inspect our registered and/or certified facilities.
We sell both Class I and Class II medical devices. A medical device, whether exempt from, or cleared pursuant to, the premarket notification requirements of the FDCA, or cleared pursuant to a premarket approval application, is subject to ongoing regulatory oversight by the FDA to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, product labeling requirements and limitations, including those related to promotion and marketing efforts, current good manufacturing practices and quality system requirements, record keeping, and medical device (adverse event) reporting. For a discussion of risks related to our regulation by the FDA and counterpart agencies of other countries, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
In addition, certain of our products utilize radioactive material. We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the management, storage, handling and disposal of these materials.
Export/Import Compliance We are required to comply with various export/import control and economic sanctions laws, including:  the International Traffic in Arms Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which, among other things, imposes license requirements on the export from the United States of defense articles and defense services (which are items specifically designed or adapted for a military application and/or listed on the United States Munitions List);  the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, which, among other things, impose licensing requirements on the export or re-export of certain dual-use goods, technology and software (which are items that potentially have both commercial and military applications);  the regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated countries, governments and persons based on United States foreign policy and national security considerations; and  the import regulatory activities of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Non-United States governments have also implemented similar export and import control regulations, which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions. For a discussion of risks related to export/import control and economic sanctions laws, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
International Operations Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams to offset economic trends in individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products. In addition, we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries. The table below describes annual revenue derived outside the U.S. as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years, by segment and in the aggregate: 13 Table of Contents YearEndedDecember31 Segment 2007 2006 2005 Professional Instrumentation 55 % 53 % 53 % Medical Technologies 63 % 66 % 73 % Industrial Technologies 50 % 50 % 38 % Tools& Components 17 % 14 % 14 % Total percentage of revenue derived outside of the United States 51 % 49 % 44 % Our principal markets outside the United States are in Europe and Asia.
The table below describes long-lived assets located outside the United States as a percentage of total long-lived assets in each of the last three years, by segment and in the aggregate: YearEndedDecember31 Segment 2007 2006 2005 Professional Instrumentation 45 % 43 % 41 % Medical Technologies 60 % 55 % 87 % Industrial Technologies 19 % 24 % 18 % Tools& Components 6 % 6 % 6 % Total 44 % 42 % 42 % For additional information related to revenues and long-lived assets by country, please refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The manner in which our products and services are sold differs by business and by region. Most of our sales in non-U.S. markets are made by subsidiaries located outside the United States, though we also sell into non-U.S. markets through various representatives and distributors and directly from the U.S. In countries with low sales volumes, we generally sell through representatives and distributors.
Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and information about the possible effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our business is set forth in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For a discussion of risks related to our non-US operations and foreign currency exchange, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Major Customers We have no customers that accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in 2007, 2006 or 2005.
Other Matters Our businesses maintain sufficient levels of working capital to support customer requirements. Our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors.

ITEM1A.
RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions, a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may face decreased demand or price reductions for our products.
Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive. Because of the diversity of products we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors. We are facing increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new, large companies into certain markets, and as a result of increasing consolidation in particular markets. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers, establish relationships with new customers, continually develop new products and services designed to maintain our leadership position in various product categories and penetrate new markets. Our failure to compete effectively may reduce our revenues, profitability and cash flow, and pricing pressures may adversely impact our profitability.
Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation.
We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation on a timely basis, our products will become technologically obsolete over time and our revenues, cash flow, profitability and competitive position will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to: 15 Table of Contents  correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;  encourage customers to adopt new technologies;  anticipate our competitors development of new products and technological innovations;  obtain adequate intellectual property rights;  innovate and develop new technologies and applications that are accepted by our customers; and  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner.
In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer.
Our growth rate could decline if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.
Visibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline in our customers' markets would likely result in diminished demand for our products and services and would adversely affect our growth rate and profitability.
Our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital. Conversely, any inability to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate could negatively impact our growth rate.
As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course, some of which may be material. During 2007 we acquired twelve businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.6 billion (including transaction costs and net of cash acquired); during 2006 we acquired eleven businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.7 billion (including transaction costs and net of cash acquired); and during 2005 we acquired 13 businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $885 million (including transaction costs and net of cash acquired). Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability:  Any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it.
Acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results.
Acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems.
We could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other systems.
We may be unable to achieve cost savings anticipated in connection with the integration of an acquired business.
We may assume by acquisition unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, or internal control deficiencies. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial position.
Conversely, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at similar rates to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate. Our ability to grow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings. In addition, changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or any further deterioration in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions or change the accounting treatment for acquisitions. For example, as a result of the recently issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No.141 (R), Business Combinations, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008, we will be required to expense certain acquisition-related items that under current accounting rules do not impact our income statement.
The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.
16 Table of Contents Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of each of their companies before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position.
The resolution of contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
We have retained responsibility for some of the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold, such as lawsuits, product liability claims and environmental matters, and agreed to indemnify the purchasers of these businesses for certain known and unknown contingent liabilities. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition but we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.
Our success depends on our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and avoid claims of infringement or misuse of third party intellectual property.
We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our operations. The steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations. In addition, from time to time in the usual course of business, we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. In the event of a successful claim against us, we could lose our rights to needed technology or be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights, any of which could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and cash flows. Even where we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs which could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.
We are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business, including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products, claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters and acquisition-related matters. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition, operations and results of operations. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.
Our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities, costs, litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.
Certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the U.S. and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in substantial compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or 17 Table of Contents current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to Item 1. Business  Regulatory Matters. We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities.
Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.
In addition to the environmental regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities and other entities at the federal, state and local levels, including the following:  We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.
Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by counterpart agencies of other countries and by regulations governing the management, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials. Violations of these regulations, efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products can lead to warning letters, declining sales, recalls, seizures, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization (ISO), and failure to comply with these rules can also adversely impact our business.
We also have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. Our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting.
In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation.
Our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.
We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, competition, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries, and could damage our reputation.
18 Table of Contents Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors may adversely affect our tax rate and decrease our profitability. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities.
Foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We have substantial assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate these items into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. In addition, we are a large buyer of steel, non-ferrous metals and petroleum-based products, as well as other commodities required for the manufacture of products. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates and commodity prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials, components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand, our business and financial results will suffer.
We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. Some of our businesses purchase their requirements of certain of these items from sole or limited source suppliers. If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials, components and equipment at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase. In addition, because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed our production requirements or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.
Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations, and the failure of governmental and other entities to adopt new regulations could adversely affect our growth rate. In addition, certain of our customers receive reimbursement from government insurance programs for some of the costs of the products that they purchase from us. Reductions in these reimbursement rates adversely impact the demand for our products.
Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition or performance of, key distributors, resellers and other channel partners could adversely affect our results of operations.
Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors, resellers and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors products, and if they favor our competitors products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse 19 Table of Contents developments in their financial condition or performance, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the consolidation of distributors in certain of our served industries, as well as the formation of large and sophisticated purchasing groups in industries such as healthcare, could adversely impact our profitability.
The inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully.
If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to:  effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated performance results from those businesses;  effectively implement the Danaher Business System throughout our organization and achieve the cost savings and other benefits that the effective implementation of the Danaher Business System can achieve; and  otherwise profitably grow our business.
International economic, political, legal and business factors could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
In 2007, approximately 51% of our sales were derived outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S., we expect to continue to increase our sales outside the U.S., particularly in emerging markets. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the U.S. Our international business is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:  interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers;  changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions;  trade protection measures;  import or export licensing requirements;  unexpected changes in laws or licensing and regulatory requirements, including negative consequences from changes in tax laws;  limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;  differing labor regulations;  differing protection of intellectual property; and  terrorist activities and the U.S. and international response thereto.
Any of these risks could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and overall growth.
Cyclical economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Certain of our businesses operate in industries that have historically experienced periodic downturns, which have adversely impacted demand for the equipment and services that we manufacture and market. Any competitive pricing pressures, slowdown in capital investments or other downturn in these industries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in any given period.
Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.
We have a number of domestic collective bargaining units and various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. While we generally have experienced satisfactory relations at our various locations, we are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.
20 Table of Contents Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our operating results.
Our defined benefit pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates and the majority of plan assets are invested in publicly traded debt and equity securities, which are affected by market risks. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely impact our future operating results.
If we suffer loss to our facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.
Our facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
Our indebtedness may limit our use of our cash flow.
As of December31, 2007, we had approximately $3.7 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we had the ability to incur an additional $0.9 billion of indebtedness in the form of commercial paper or bank loans under our outstanding facilities and programs. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:  requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes;  reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and  exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.
We may incur significantly more debt in the future. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase. In addition, any further deterioration in the credit markets may impact the availability and cost of future debt borrowings.
ITEM1B.
UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM2.
PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in Washington, D.C. in a facility that we lease.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of the Companys financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Companys MD&A is divided into four main sections:  Overview  Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Critical Accounting Policies The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited consolidated financial statements.
OVERVIEW Danaher strives to create shareholder value through:  delivering sales growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for its products and services;  upper quartile financial performance compared to Danahers peer companies; and  upper quartile cash flow generation from operations compared to Danahers peer companies.
To accomplish these goals, the Company uses a set of tools and processes, known as the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM (DBS), which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. Within the DBS framework, the Company also pursues a number of ongoing strategic initiatives intended to improve operational performance, including global sourcing of materials and services and innovative product development. The Company also acquires businesses that it believes can help it achieve the objectives described above, and believes that many acquisition opportunities remain available within its target markets. The Company will acquire businesses when they strategically fit with existing operations or when they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic line of business.The extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and effectively integrated can affect the Companys overall growth and operating results. The Company also continually assesses the strategic fit of its existing businesses and may divest businesses that are not deemed to strategically fit with ongoing operations or are not achieving the desired return on investment.
Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. In 2007, approximately 51% of Danahers sales were derived outside the United States. As a global business, Danahers operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry economic and political factors.However, Danahers geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of its product sales and services, has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results.Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Companys individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. In addition, the Companys order rates are highly indicative of the Companys revenue in the short term and thus a key measure of anticipated performance. In those industry segments where the Company is a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the Companys customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy.
Significant Acquisitions and Divestitures In November 2007, the Company significantly expanded its test and measurement business with the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Tektronix, Inc. (Tektronix) for total cash consideration of approximately $2.8 billion, including transaction costs and net of cash and debt acquired. Tektronix is a leading supplier of test, measurement, and monitoring products, solutions and services for engineers in the communications, computer, consumer electronics and education industries, as well as in military/aerospace, semiconductor and a broad range of other industries 26 Table of Contents worldwide. Tektronix had annual revenues of approximately $1.1 billion in its most recently completed fiscal year, and is part of Danahers test and measurement business included in the Professional Instrumentation segment. The Company funded the purchase price of the Tektronix acquisition with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and the Companys November 2007 common stock offering (described below), and to a lesser extent from available cash.
Tektronix is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Companys test and measurement business, both through the growth of existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. The combination of Tektronix with Danahers existing test and measurement businesses is also expected to yield significant cost reductions. Company management and other personnel are devoting significant attention to the successful integration of the Tektronix business into Danaher.
On November7, 2007, the Company completed the underwritten public offering of 6.9million shares of Danaher common stock at a price to the public of $82.25 per share. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters discount, were approximately $550 million, which were used to partially fund the acquisition of Tektronix. In addition, on December11, 2007, the Company completed the underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes). The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters discount, were approximately $493 million, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of Tektronix.
In July 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of ChemTreat, Inc. (ChemTreat) for a cash purchase price of $425 million including transaction costs. No cash was acquired in the transaction. ChemTreat is a leading provider of industrial water treatment products and services, and had annual revenues of $200 million in its most recent completed fiscal year. ChemTreat is part of the Companys environmental business included within the Professional Instrumentation segment. ChemTreat is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Companys water quality business both through the growth of existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. The Company financed the acquisition of ChemTreat primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from available cash.
Also during July 2007, the Company completed the sale of its power quality business for a cash sales price of $275 million net of transaction costs and recorded an after-tax gain of $150 million ($0.45 per diluted share). Prior to the sale, this business was part of the Industrial Technologies segment. The Company has reported the power quality business as a discontinued operation in this Form 10-K in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Accordingly, the results of operations for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the power quality business as a discontinued operation.
Business Performance While differences exist among the Companys businesses, the Company generally continued to see market growth during the year ended December31, 2007. The Companys year-over-year growth rates reflect continued strength in global economic conditions, particularly Europe and Asia, and to a lesser extent, North America. In addition, the growth reflects the continued shift of the Companys operations into higher growth sectors of the economy. Growth rates slowed somewhat from the rate experienced in 2006 partially due to difficult comparisons with sales levels in 2006 within the Companys product identification businesses and the impact of regulatory changes in the Companys engine retarder business discussed below.
The Company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in the markets and geographies served. The Companys performance will be impacted by its ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and geographies it serves, including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force, consolidation of competitors, the expansion of market opportunities in Asia, increasing significance of technology and intellectual property in the businesses in which the Company operates and increases in raw material costs.The Company will continue to assess market needs with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner.
27 Table of Contents Although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its sales are generated in foreign currencies. Sales by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively.
The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S.dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements. On an overall basis, the U.S. dollar weakened against other major currencies in 2007 and closed the year at exchange rate levels weaker than the exchange rate levels as of the end of 2006. The impact of currency rate changes increased reported sales by approximately 3.5% during the year ended December31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December31, 2006. Any further weakening of the U.S.dollar against other major currencies would benefit the Companys future results of operations. Any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the Companys future sales and results of operations.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated sales from continuing operations for the year ended December31, 2007 increased approximately 16.5% over the comparable period of 2006. Sales from existing businesses contributed 4.5% growth. Acquisitions contributed 8.5% to the sales growth during 2007. The impact of currency translation on sales provided 3.5% growth as the U.S. dollar weakened against other major currencies throughout 2007. References in this report to sales from existing businesses include sales from acquired businesses starting from and after the first anniversary of the acquisition, but exclude currency effect.
The growth in sales from acquisitions in the year ended December31, 2007 primarily related to acquisitions in the Companys Medical Technologies and Professional Instrumentation businesses. The acquisitions of Sybron Dental Specialties, Inc. (Sybron) in May 2006 and Vision Systems Limited (Vision), at the end of 2006, both of which are part of the Medical Technologies segment, have contributed the majority of this year-over-year acquisition-related revenue growth. Also contributing to the year-over-year growth are the acquisitions of ChemTreat in July 2007 and Tektronix in November 2007, both of which are included in the Professional Instrumentation segment, and the acquisitions of other smaller businesses in the Medical Technologies, Professional Instrumentation and Industrial Technologies segments.
Operating profit margins from continuing operations for the Company were 15.8% in the year ended December31, 2007 as compared to 15.9% for the year ended December31, 2006. Following are the key factors impacting the year-over-year comparison of operating profit margins:  Operating profit margin improvements in the Companys existing businesses contributed 85 basis points of margin improvement primarily as a result of broad-based operating profit margin improvements across the Companys business segments. Operating profit margins benefited from on-going cost reduction initiatives including application of the Danaher Business System and low-cost region sourcing and production initiatives and the additional leverage created from sales growth compared with the prior year period. The ongoing application of the Danaher Business System in each of our segments, and the Companys low-cost region sourcing and production initiatives, are both expected to positively impact operating profit margins at both existing and newly acquired businesses in future periods.
The dilutive impact of acquisitions reduced 2007 operating profit margins by 90 basis points, including the expensing of approximately $68.2 million of acquisition related charges for in-process research and development and the fair values of acquired inventory and deferred revenues during 2007 in connection with the acquisition of Textronix.
28 Table of Contents The effective tax rate for 2007 of 25.8% reflects net discrete tax benefits of approximately $21 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. New tax legislation that was signed into law in several taxing jurisdictions during 2007, most notably in Germany and Denmark, reduced income tax rates for 2008 and future periods which resulted in a reduction in the Companys deferred tax liabilities and a like reduction in 2007 income tax expense as required under SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The lower statutory rates are expected to be offset by other statutory changes in these jurisdictions, such that the Company's effective tax rate in future years will not be materially reduced as a result of the legislation. Partially offsetting the benefit from the above tax rate reduction was the effect of establishing income tax reserves during the year related to uncertain tax positions in various taxing jurisdiction, net of the reduction of tax reserves associated with Sweden. Refer to Note 13 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company expects the tax rate for 2008 to be approximately 27%.
The following table summarizes sales by business segment for each of the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December31 ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Professional Instrumentation $ 3,537.9 $ 2,906.5 $ 2,600.6 Medical Technologies 2,998.0 2,220.0 1,181.5 Industrial Technologies 3,153.4 2,988.8 2,794.9 Tools& Components 1,336.6 1,350.8 1,294.5 Total $ 11,025.9 $ 9,466.1 $ 7,871.5 PROFESSIONAL INSTRUMENTATION Businesses in the Professional Instrumentation segment offer professional and technical customers various products and services that are used in connection with the performance of their work. The Professional Instrumentation segment encompasses two strategic businesses: environmental and test and measurement. These businesses produce and sell bench top and compact, professional electronic test tools and calibration equipment; water quality instrumentation and consumables and ultraviolet disinfection systems; industrial water treatment solutions; and retail/commercial petroleum products and services, including dispensers, payment systems, underground storage tank leak detection and vapor recovery systems.
Professional Instrumentation Selected Financial Data For the Years Ended December31 ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Sales $ 3,537.9 $ 2,906.5 $ 2,600.6 Operating Profit 709.5 625.6 538.3 Depreciation and amortization 64.8 48.8 47.8 Operating profit as a % of sales 20.1 % 21.5 % 20.7 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 1.8 % 1.7 % 1.8 % Components of Sales Growth 2007vs.2006 2006vs.2005 Existing businesses 6.5 % 7.5 % Acquisitions 12.0 % 4.0 % Currency exchange rates 3.5 % 0.5 % Total 22.0 % 12.0 % 29 Table of Contents 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 As detailed in the table above, segment sales for Professional Instrumentation increased 22.0% for 2007 compared to 2006. Sales from existing businesses increased in both of the segments strategic lines of business. Prices accounted for approximately 1.5% sales growth and the impact of that increase is reflected in sales from existing businesses.
Operating profit margins were 20.1% in 2007 compared to 21.5% in 2006. Operating profit margin improvements of 135 basis points related to existing businesses were more than offset by the dilutive impact of lower operating profit margins of acquired businesses, which reduced segment operating profit margins by 260 basis points compared to 2006. Included in the dilutive impact on operating margins from acquired businesses is approximately $68 million (185 basis points) in charges associated with the acquisition of Tektronix, primarily related to acquired in-process research and development activities, acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue. In addition, year over year comparisons are impacted by a gain on the sale of real estate during 2006 and recovery of certain previously written-off receivables during 2006 which increased that periods operating profit margins by 15 basis points.
Overview of Businesses within Professional Instrumentation Segment Environmental.
Sales from the Companys environmental businesses, representing approximately 60% of segment sales for 2007, increased 16.5% in 2007 compared to 2006. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 6.0% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 7.0% growth and currency translation accounted for 3.5% growth.
The Companys water quality businesses experienced low-double digit revenue growth for 2007 compared to 2006, primarily as a result of strength in sales of laboratory and process instrumentation products in all major geographic regions. In addition, sales of the Companys ultraviolet water treatment systems grew double-digit compared to 2006. Investment in sales forces and other growth initiatives, in addition to continued penetration of the Asian wastewater market, including a significant reclamation project in Australia, contributed to the growth. Sales growth from acquisitions primarily relates to the acquisition of ChemTreat in July 2007. The acquisition of ChemTreat expands the scope of the water quality business in the area of industrial water treatment solutions and is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities from existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses.
The Gilbarco Veeder-Root retail petroleum equipment business experienced low-single digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. The business point of sale payment systems and service business enjoyed robust growth in 2007, primarily in Europe. In addition, the business experienced strong demand during 2007 for its recently introduced leak detection systems in North America and China during 2007. These sales gains were offset by difficult prior year comparisons, a result of strong dispenser sales in 2006 due to extensive refurbishment activity in Europe and regulatory mandates in Mexico that did not repeat in 2007.
Test and Measurement.
Sales from the Companys test and measurement businesses, representing approximately 40% of segment sales for 2007, grew 31.5% compared to 2006. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 8.0% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 20.0% growth and currency translation accounted for approximately 3.5% growth.
New product offerings in the thermography, power quality test and process calibration markets generated strong sales in the electrical and industrial channels in all major geographical areas during 2007. The network test business experienced mid-single digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. Large orders from telecommunications carriers in the United States during the first three quarters of 2007 and cable test equipment sales in Europe were the primary drivers of the network test growth.
Acquisition growth was primarily related to the acquisition of Tektronix in addition to several smaller acquisitions throughout the year. The acquisition of Tektronix in November 2007 substantially increases the product line and geographic scope of the test and measurement business, particularly in Asia, and is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth of existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. The combination of Tektronix with Danahers existing test and measurement business is also expected to yield significant cost reductions.
30 Table of Contents 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 Professional Instrumentation segment sales increased 12% for 2006 compared to 2005. Price increases contributed 1.5% to overall sales growth compared to 2005. Sales from existing businesses increased in both of the Company's strategic lines of business.
Operating profit margins for the segment were 21.5% in 2006 compared to 20.7% for 2005. Operating profit margin improvements in the segments existing businesses were offset by the lower operating margins of acquired businesses which reduced segment operating margins by approximately 40 basis points in 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, the implementation of SFAS No.123R reduced operating profit for the segment by approximately $14.7 million and contributed to a 50 basis point reduction in operating profit margins in 2006 compared to 2005.
Overview of Businesses within Professional Instrumentation Segment Environmental.
Sales from the Companys environmental businesses, representing approximately 63% of segment sales for 2006, increased 10.5% in 2006 compared to 2005. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 8% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 2% growth and currency translation accounted for 0.5% growth.
The Companys water quality businesses experienced mid-single digit sales growth for 2006. This growth was primarily the result of strength in the business laboratory and process instrumentation products in both the North American and European markets. Sales in Asia grew over 20% in 2006 reflecting continued penetration of these markets. The business ultra analytics business reported mid-single digit growth in 2006. Sales growth in North America and Europe, as well as the impact of new product introductions, drove the improvements. Lower sales in Asia reflecting in part a difficult comparable sales period in 2005 due to certain large projects not repeating in 2006, partially offset these improvements. Sales growth from acquired businesses primarily reflects the impact of three smaller acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2006.
The Gilbarco Veeder-Root retail petroleum product and service business reported high-single digit sales growth in 2006 compared to low single-digit sales growth in 2005. This growth was driven by extensive refurbishment activity in Europe and regulatory incentives in Mexico that encouraged dispensers to be embedded with tamper proof capability. The businesses newly introduced dispensing equipment and its recently introduced point of sale equipment were favorably received which also contributed to this growth.
Test and Measurement.
Sales from the Companys test and measurement businesses, representing approximately 37% of segment sales for 2006, grew 14.5% compared to 2005. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 7.0% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 7.5% growth and currency translation had a negligible impact.
Sales growth from existing businesses in 2006 continued the strong growth experienced throughout 2005. The business experienced high-single digit growth in traditional industrial channels in all major geographic regions with particular strength in the Asian and Latin American markets. Demand for the businesses thermography and new power quality test products contributed significantly to this overall growth. The Companys network test business reported mid-single digit sales growth for 2006 compared to 2005. Sales growth slowed in North America and Europe in 2006 compared to 2005 since 2005 benefited from several new product launches. The network-test business experienced somewhat stronger sales growth in China and Latin America in 2006 compared to 2005.
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES The Medical Technologies segment consists of businesses which offer dentists, other doctors and hospital and research professionals various products and services that are used in connection with the performance of their work.

Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed 1.0% to overall sales growth in 2007 compared to 2006.
Operating profit margin improvements in the segments existing businesses contributed 100 basis points to the overall operating margin improvement in 2007. Improvements in the operating profit margins of the dental consumable, acute care diagnostic and life sciences instrumentation businesses were partially offset by lower operating profit margins in the dental equipment businesses. Recently acquired businesses adversely impacted 2007 operating profit margins by 40 basis points as compared to 2006. In addition, on a comparative basis, 2007 operating margins benefited approximately 50 basis points from the adverse impact on 2006 operating margins that resulted from charges recorded associated with the fair value of acquired inventory related to the acquisition of Sybron.
Overview of Businesses within Medical Technologies Segment The segments dental business experienced mid-single digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. The business experienced increased sales volumes in its restorative and orthodontia products as well as in the instrument and treatment unit product offerings across all major geographies. In addition, increased sales of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional imaging products contributed to the revenue growth in the European market. This growth was partially offset by a decline in instrument and treatment unit sales to Asia reflecting a weak overall Japanese market and the need to re-register certain products with regulatory authorities in South Korea.
Radiometers acute care diagnostics business experienced high-single digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. Increasing sales of diagnostic instruments in Europe (particularly Russia) in 2007 contributed to this sales growth. The North American and Asia/Pacific markets also contributed to the growth, although at somewhat lower rates than those experienced in the European markets. The increase in instrument placements in 2007 is expected to result in increased consumables sales in future periods. New product introductions resulting from the business continued research and development efforts are also contributing to this growth.
Leica Microsystems life science instrumentation business experienced mid-teens revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. Robust microscopy demand, particularly confocal microscopes, in North America and Asia were the primary growth drivers. The integration of Vision with Leica Microsystems has been completed and has generated 32 Table of Contents incremental revenue growth, the majority of which has been included as a component of acquisition growth during 2007. Visions revenue grew approximately 30% in 2007 compared to 2006 when it was a stand-alone company.
2006 COMPARED TO 2005 Medical Technologies segment sales increased 88% for 2006 compared to 2005. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed approximately 1% to overall sales growth compared to 2005.
Operating profit margins for the segment were 11.8% in 2006 compared to 11.7% for 2005. Operating profit margin improvements in the segments existing operations, largely as a result of margin improvements within the dental technology businesses, were offset by the lower operating margins of acquired businesses, primarily Leica and the expensing of in-process research and development in connection with the acquisition of Vision which reduced operating profit margins for the year ended December31, 2006 by approximately 45 basis points compared to 2005. In addition, the implementation of SFAS No.123R resulted in approximately $6 million of stock option compensation expense and reduced operating profit margins for the year ended December31, 2006 by approximately 30 basis points compared to 2005. The Company also recorded a $4.5 million charge in the first quarter of 2006 for impairment of a minority interest in a medical technologies company, which reduced 2006 operating profit margins by approximately 20 basis points compared to 2005.
Overview of Businesses within Medical Technologies Segment The Companys dental technology businesses experienced high-single digit growth in 2006 compared to 2005. Growth in the dental technology businesses was driven by continued strength in the instrument product lines as well as strong sales of imaging product lines in North America and Asia driven by new product introductions. The Company completed two acquisitions subsequent to December31, 2006 which further enhanced its imaging product offerings. Sybron experienced low-double digit sales growth in 2006; however, all Sybron sales in 2006 are reported as a component of acquisition growth due to its May 2006 acquisition.
Radiometers acute care diagnostics business experienced mid-single digit growth in 2006 compared to 2005. Radiometers sales improved in all major geographic regions with particular strength in sales of consumables in Europe resulting from broad based diagnostic instrument placements in the first half of 2006.
Leicas life science instrumentation business experienced high-single digit growth in 2006 compared to 2005. Strength from the sale of stereo microscopes and specimen preparation equipment drove growth in Europe and Asia, and to a lesser extent North America. Leicas sales have been included as a component of sales from existing businesses since the first anniversary of the acquisition and were reported as a component of acquisition growth prior to that anniversary date. Vision has been consolidated with the segments results as of the date the Company gained control of Vision in November 2006 and its sales are also included as a component of acquisition growth for 2006.
INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES Businesses in the Industrial Technologies segment manufacture products and sub-systems that are typically incorporated by customers and systems integrators into production and packaging lines as well as incorporated by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) into various end-products. Many of the businesses also provide services to support their products, including helping customers integrate and install the products and helping ensure product uptime. The Industrial Technologies segment encompasses two strategic businesses, motion and product identification, and two focused niche businesses, aerospace and defense, and sensors& controls. These businesses produce and sell product identification equipment and consumables; motion, position, speed, temperature, and level instruments and sensing devices; liquid flow and quality measuring devices; safety devices; and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company disposed of the power quality businesses that were part of this segment and all current and prior year period results of the segment have been adjusted to exclude the results of these discontinued operations.
33 Table of Contents Industrial Technologies Segment Selected Financial Data For the Years Ended December31 ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Sales $ 3,153.4 $ 2,988.8 $ 2,794.9 Operating profit 532.5 467.7 409.3 Depreciation and amortization 63.2 61.1 60.4 Operating profit as a % of sales 16.9 % 15.7 % 14.6 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 2.0 % 2.0 % 2.2 % Components of Sales Growth 2007vs.2006 2006vs.2005 Existing businesses 1.5 % 6.0 % Acquisitions 0.5 % 1.0 % Currency exchange rates 3.5 % 0.5 % Total 5.5 % 7.5 % 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 Price increases contributed 1.5% of sales growth compared to 2006 which impact is reflected in sales from existing businesses.
Operating profit margin improvements in the segments existing businesses contributed 85 basis points to the overall operating margin improvement for 2007 as compared to 2006. This margin improvement was driven in part by continued margin expansion in the motion businesses reflecting pricing and productivity initiatives as well as the impact of lower levels of lower-margin United States Postal Service (USPS) sales in 2007 compared to 2006 within the product identification business. In addition, during 2007, the segment recorded a pre-tax gain of $12 million upon collection of indemnification proceeds related to a lawsuit, which improved operating profit margins by 40 basis points for 2007. These positive factors were partially offset by new acquisitions, restructuring activities, spending for product development and emerging market sales force initiatives, all of which are expected to have a positive impact in 2008.
Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment Motion Sales in the Companys motion businesses, representing approximately 34% of segment sales in 2007, increased 2.5% over 2006. Sales from existing businesses accounted for a 1.0% decrease in sales and currency translation accounted for 3.5% growth in sales during 2007. There were no acquisitions in the business in 2007 or 2006.
During 2007, the motion business experienced sales growth primarily in the elevator markets as a result of global conversions to more energy efficient systems and new construction demand in Asia. Demand in OEM applications in Europe also contributed year-over-year sales growth. These growth drivers, however, were more than offset by year-over-year sales declines resulting from weakness in certain technology end markets as well as declines in the miniature motors business reflecting reduced customer demand.
Product Identification.
The product identification businesses accounted for approximately 28% of segment sales in 2007. Sales from the Companys product identification businesses increased 3.5% in 2007 compared to 2006. Sales 34 Table of Contents from existing businesses accounted for a 1.0% decline while currency translation contributed 3.5% to revenue growth and acquisitions contributed 1.0% to revenue growth in 2007.
The 2007 decline in sales from existing operations resulted from the business completing several large systems installation projects with the USPS during 2006 which did not repeat in 2007. Sales for the business non-USPS marking products grew at a mid-single digit rates during 2007 compared to 2006. Strong equipment and after-market sales, particularly in China, Latin America and Europe, were the primary drivers of this growth facilitated by increased investments in the business sales force and new product launches in these regions.
Focused Niche Businesses The segments niche businesses in the aggregate experienced 10% sales growth in 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was primarily driven by strong sales growth from existing businesses in the Companys aerospace and defense businesses, partially offset by sales declines in the Companys sensors and controls business, reflecting continued softness in the semi-conductor and electronic assembly markets.
2006 COMPARED TO 2005 Sales growth from existing businesses was due primarily to sales growth in the motion, aerospace and defense and sensor and controls businesses. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed approximately 1.5% to overall sales growth compared to 2005. Several small acquisitions in 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 accounted for 1% growth.
Operating profit margins for the segment were 15.7% in 2006 compared to 14.6% in 2005. The overall improvement in operating profit margins was driven primarily by additional leverage from sales growth, on-going cost reductions associated with Danaher Business System initiatives completed during 2005 and 2006, and margin improvements in businesses acquired in prior years, which typically have higher cost structures than the Companys existing operations. Recently acquired businesses had no dilutive impact on overall operating profit margins for 2006. The improvements to operating profit margins were partially offset by the implementation of SFAS No.123R which required the Company to record approximately $14.5 million of stock option compensation costs and reduced operating profit margins by 45 basis points in 2006 compared with 2005. Operating profit margin comparisons for 2006 compared to 2005 are also negatively impacted by 35 basis points related to gains on sale of a business and the collection of a previously reserved note receivable during 2005 and were positively impacted by 65 basis points related to a fourth quarter 2005 loss from the settlement of patent infringement litigation not repeating in 2006.
Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment Motion.
Sales in the Companys motion businesses, representing approximately 33% of segment sales in 2006, increased by 6% over 2005. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 5% growth; acquisitions accounted for 0.5% growth and currency translation contributed growth of 0.5%.
Sales from existing businesses increased from 2005 levels due primarily to broad based growth across the standard and custom motor, drive and controls lines. This growth was somewhat offset by softness in certain technology end markets. The business also experienced continued growth in sales of its linear products during 2006.
Product Identification.
The product identification businesses accounted for approximately 27% of segment sales in 2006. Sales from the Companys product identification businesses increased 3.5% in 2006 compared to 2005. Existing businesses provided 2.5% growth. Favorable currency impacts accounted for 1% growth. Acquisitions had a negligible impact on growth for 2006.
The increase in sales is due primarily to the increase in sales of laser and thermal transfer overlay equipment as well as sales of consumables and services in North America and Europe. These increases in sales were offset by the completion of several large United States Postal Service (USPS) projects in the first half of 2006 at both AccuSort and Videojet.
Focused Niche Businesses.
The segments niche businesses in the aggregate experienced 11.0% sales growth in 2006 compared to 2005. This growth was primarily driven by strong sales growth from existing businesses in the Companys sensors and controls and aerospace and defense businesses.
35 Table of Contents TOOLS& COMPONENTS The Tools& Components segment is one of the largest producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics hand tools. Other products manufactured by the businesses in this segment include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment; drill chucks; and custom-designed fasteners and components.
Tools& Components Selected Financial Data For the Years Ended December31 ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Sales $ 1,336.6 $ 1,350.8 $ 1,294.5 Operating profit 175.6 194.1 199.3 Depreciation and amortization 20.8 21.4 22.8 Operating profit as a % of sales 13.1 % 14.4 % 15.4 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 1.6 % 1.6 % 1.8 % Components of Sales Growth 2007vs.2006 2006vs.2005 Existing businesses (0.5 )% 4.5 % Product line divestiture (1.0 )% 0.0 % Currency exchange rates 0.5 % 0.0 % Total (1.0 )% 4.5 % 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 Sales from existing businesses for 2007 reflect the impact of certain regulatory requirements that became effective at the beginning of 2007 which accelerated demand for the Companys engine retarder products in 2006 and have adversely impacted demand in 2007. Price increases partially offset the decline in sales and contributed approximately 2.5% of sales growth compared to 2006. The impact of that increase is reflected in sales from existing businesses.
Operating profit margins for the segment were 13.1% in 2007 compared to 14.4% in 2006. Costs associated with workforce reductions and adjustments to production levels to match demand in the engine retarder business decreased operating profit margins by 85 basis in 2007 compared with 2006. Lower sales volumes in the mechanics hand tool business with Sears/K-Mart and increased lead costs in the wheel weight business also had a negative impact on the 2007 operating margins. In addition, operating profit margins were adversely impacted by 40 basis points as a result of expenses incurred in connection with a fire in one of the business manufacturing facilities in China and restructuring costs incurred primarily in the fourth quarter of 2007 to close one facility and reduce headcount.
Overview of Businesses within the Tools& Components Segment Mechanics hand tools sales, representing approximately 70% of segment sales in 2007, grew 1.0% in 2007 compared to 2006. The segments Matco business grew slightly during 2007 as the business benefited from recent product introductions and price increases which offset declines in distributor average purchase levels during 2007. The retail hand tool business experienced strength in China and in its export business to Europe, as well as certain of its retail channels. This performance, in large part, was offset by a decline in sales to Sears/K-Mart, the retail hand tools business largest customer. Year-over-year softness in same-store sales of hand tools at Sears/K-Mart continues to impact adversely the business.
36 Table of Contents The segments niche businesses experienced mid-single digit sales declines during 2007 as compared to 2006. The impact of the regulatory issue noted above was partially offset by improved sales performance in the segments wheel service business during 2007 driven by price increases necessary to recover increased lead costs.
2006 COMPARED TO 2005 Sales from existing businesses contributed substantially all of the growth for the segment in 2006, including approximately 1.5% growth due to price increases that the Company implemented largely as a result of cost increases in steel and other commodities.
Operating profit margins for the segment were 14.4% in 2006 compared to 15.4% in 2005. Implementation of SFAS No.123R in the first quarter of 2006 reduced segment operating profit by approximately $6 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, negatively impacting year-over-year operating margins by 45 basis points. The Company also incurred costs associated with exiting a small product line during the second half of 2006 which reduced 2006 operating profit margins by approximately 30 basis points. Operating profit margins also declined during 2006 due to lower margin products accounting for a larger proportion of sales within the segment as well as due to higher overall freight costs. Finally, year-over-year operating margin comparisons were negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points as a result of a $5.3 million ($3.9 million after taxes) gain on the sale of real estate in 2005. The adverse impacts on operating margins described above were offset somewhat by the impact of leverage from higher sales levels, including the pricing actions implemented in 2006, as well as the benefit of restructuring actions taken in 2005.
Overview of Businesses within the Tools& Components Segment Mechanics hand tools sales, representing approximately 70% of segment sales, grew 5% in 2006 compared to 2005. The sales growth was driven primarily by the groups Matco business which achieved high-single digit growth during 2006 driven by increases in both the number of distributors and their average purchase levels. The retail mechanics hand tools business also grew in the second half of 2006 compared to the second half of 2005 as sell-through at Sears, a major customer of the segment, improved from prior year levels. The business continued to experience growth with its other retail customers as well as expanding markets for the business products in China. The segments niche businesses experienced mid-single digit sales growth for 2006 compared to 2005 as strength in the truck box and engine retarder businesses was partially offset by weakness in the chuck business.
GROSS PROFIT For the Years Ended December31 ($in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Sales $ 11,025.9 $ 9,466.1 $ 7,871.5 Cost of sales 5,985.0 5,269.0 4,467.3 Gross profit 5,040.9 4,197.1 3,404.2 Gross profit margin 45.7 % 44.3 % 43.2 % The increase in gross profit margins from continuing operations for 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted from leverage on increased sales volume, the on-going cost improvements in existing business units driven by our Danaher Business System processes and low-cost region initiatives and generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired and increases in selling prices. Gross profit margins also improved due to lower-margin sales to United States Postal Service in the product identification business comprising a smaller proportion of sales during 2007 compared to 2006. The gross margins for 2007 also benefited from the inclusion of a full year of results from higher-margin Sybron business as compared to 2006 which only included seven months of Sybron results as a result of Sybron acquisition in May 2006. The improvements were partially offset by higher commodity costs incurred in 2007 for which full recovery in the form of price increases dilutes reported margins.
37 Table of Contents Gross profit margins from continuing operations for 2006 benefited from leverage on increased sales volume, the on-going cost improvements in existing business units driven by our Danaher Business System processes and low-cost region initiatives, generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired. Increases in selling prices to offset some of the increases in cost and surcharges related to steel and other commodity purchases also contributed to gross profit improvement. These improvements were partially offset by a change in mix to certain lower margin businesses including the Gilbarco Veeder-Root business and sales to the United States Postal Service in the product identification business. In addition, the Company recorded a loss on a product development venture in the first quarter of 2006 and incurred higher initial product costs associated with the Sybron acquisition in the second quarter of 2006, which further reduced gross margins for the year ended December31, 2006.
OPERATING EXPENSES For the Years Ended December31 ($in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Sales $ 11,025.9 $ 9,466.1 $ 7,871.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,713.1 2,273.2 1,777.7 Research and development expenses 601.4 440.0 374.3 SG&A as a % of sales 24.6 % 24.0 % 22.6 % R&D as a % of sales 5.5 % 4.6 % 4.8 % Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points during 2007 as compared to 2006 levels. The year-over-year increases resulted from recently acquired businesses (principally Sybron Dental and Vision) which generally have higher operating expense structures, compared to the Companys other businesses, as well as increased investment in sales forces in emerging markets. These increases were partially offset by operating leverage from higher sales during 2007 as compared to 2006. In addition, the recovery of certain previously written-off indemnity receivable balances during 2007 favorably impacted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were higher in 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of the higher operating expense structures of businesses acquired during 2006 as well as the implementation of SFAS No.123R at the beginning of 2006 which required the Company to record approximately $55.0 million in stock option compensation costs.
Research and development expenses, consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs, as a percentage of sales, were approximately 90 basis points higher in 2007 as compared to 2006. In 2007, the Company expensed approximately $60.4 million of in-process research and development related to the Tektronix acquisition as compared to approximately $6.5 million of in-process research and development expensed in 2006 related to the Vision acquisition. Newly acquired companies and their higher, relative research and development cost structures also contributed to the year-over-year increase. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales during 2006 were consistent with the 2005 level. The Company continues to invest in new product development within all of its businesses, with particular emphasis on the medical technologies, test and measurement, environmental and product identification businesses.
INTEREST COSTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS For a description of the Companys outstanding indebtedness, please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources  Financing Activities and Indebtedness below.
Interest expense of $109.7 million in 2007 was approximately $30.3 million higher than 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels during 2007, due to borrowings incurred to fund the 2007 acquisitions of Tektronix and ChemTreat and the 2006 acquisitions of Sybron and Vision. Interest expense for 2006 was higher than 2005 by approximately $34.9 million. The increase in interest expense in 2006 compared to 2005 was also due to higher debt levels during 2006 as compared to 2005, as a result of borrowings incurred to fund the acquisitions of Sybron Dental and Vision.
38 Table of Contents Interest income of $6.1 million, $8.0 million and $14.7 million was recognized in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Average invested cash balances were lower in 2007 compared to 2006 due to employing cash balances to complete several acquisitions in late 2006 and throughout 2007 as well as to repurchase shares of Company common stock in 2007. In addition, lower interest rates prevailing during 2007 contributed to the decrease in interest income. Average invested cash balances decreased during 2006 compared to 2005 due to employing cash balances to complete several acquisitions in 2005 and 2006, to finance repurchases of the Companys outstanding common stock in the second half of 2005 and to repay the previously outstanding Eurobonds in July 2005. In addition, 2005 interest income reflects the collection of $4.6 million of interest on a note receivable which had not previously been recorded due to collection risk.
INCOME TAXES General The Companys effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below) and changes in tax laws. The tax effect of significant unusual items or changes in tax regulations is reflected in the period in which they occur. The Companys effective tax rate for 2007 differs from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the United States. No provisions for United States income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. The amount of United States income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings. As of December31, 2007, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States was approximately $5.4 billion.
The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments.Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for potential tax contingencies. Based on these reviews and the result of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit, reserves are adjusted as necessary. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Companys estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved.Additionally, the jurisdictions in which the Companys earnings and/or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates.
Year-Over-Year Changes in Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January1, 2007.As a result of the implementation of Interpretation No.48, the Company recognized a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $63 million, which was accounted for as an increase to the January1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.
The Companys effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 25.8%, 22.4% and 27.3%, respectively.
The effective tax rate for 2007 of 25.8% reflects net discrete tax benefits of approximately $21 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. New tax legislation that was signed into law in several taxing jurisdictions during 2007, most notably in Germany and Denmark, reduced income tax rates for 2008 and future periods which resulted in a reduction in the Companys deferred tax liabilities and a like reduction in 2007 income tax expense as required under SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The lower statutory rates are expected to be offset by other statutory changes in these jurisdictions, such that the Company's effective tax rate in future years will not be materially reduced as a result of the legislation. Partially offsetting the benefit from the above tax rate reduction was the effect of establishing income tax reserves during the year related to uncertain tax positions in various taxing jurisdiction, net of the reduction of tax reserves associated with Sweden. Refer to Note 13 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
39 Table of Contents The Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations of 22.4% for 2006 was 4.9% lower than the effective tax rate for 2005. The effective tax rate for 2006 benefited by $69 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, as a result of the reduction of valuation allowances related to foreign tax credit carryforwards that are now expected to be realized, the favorable resolution of examinations of certain previously filed returns which resulted in the reduction of previously provided tax reserves and the impact of a change in German tax law which entitles the Company to cash payments in lieu of previously held unrecognized tax credits. These positive impacts were partially mitigated by a higher effective tax rate applicable to the second quarter 2006 gain on the sale of shares of First Technology, plc (see Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) which increased the overall provision by $1.5 million compared to what would have been incurred using the Companys overall effective tax rate.
The effective tax rate for 2008 is expected to be approximately 27%.
INFLATION Inflation did not significantly impact the Companys overall results of operations in either 2007 or 2006.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Companys broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole.
Interest Rate Risk The fair value of fixed-rate long-term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact. Based on a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis-point increase in interest rates at December31, 2007, the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate long-term debt, excluding the LYONs, would decrease by approximately $74 million. The LYONs have not been included in this calculation as the value of the convertible debt is primarily derived from the LYONs conversion feature. This methodology has certain limitations, and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the Companys results of operations or financial condition under current accounting principles. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.1% notes due 2008 having an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective interest rate on $100 million of these notes is the six month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. In accordance with SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. These instruments qualify as effective or perfect hedges. Other than the above noted swap arrangements, there were no material derivative financial instrument transactions during any of the periods presented. Additionally, the Company does not have significant commodity contracts or other derivatives.
Exchange Rate Risk Although the Company has a U.S.dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its sales are generated in foreign currencies. Sales by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies.Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively.
The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S.dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Eurobond Notes described below, as well as the European component of the 40 Table of Contents commercial paper program, which as of December31, 2007 had aggregate outstanding borrowings in an amount equivalent to $969 million, provide a natural hedge to a portion of the Companys European net asset position.
Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, interest rate swap agreements and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments.The Company anticipates, however, that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under these instruments. The Company places cash and temporary investments and its interest rate swap agreements with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution.Although the Company does not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments, it does periodically evaluate the credit standing of the counter party financial institutions. In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the Companys customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity ($ in millions) For the Years Ended December31 2007 2006 2005 Operating cash flows from continuing operations $ 1,699.3 $ 1,530.8 $ 1,189.3 Operating cash flows from discontinued operations (53.5 ) 16.5 14.5 Net cash flows from operating activities 1,645.8 1,547.3 1,203.8 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (162.1 ) (136.4 ) (119.7 ) Cash paid for acquisitions (3,576.6 ) (2,656.1 ) (885.1 ) Cash paid for investment in acquisition target and other marketable securities (23.2 ) (84.1 )  Proceeds from sale of investment and divestitures 301.3 98.5 22.1 Other sources 15.5 10.0 18.8 Investing cash flows from continued operations (3,445.1 ) (2,768.1 ) (963.9 ) Investing cash flows from discontinued operations (0.7 ) (1.3 ) (1.5 ) Net cash used in investing activities (3,445.8 ) (2,769.4 ) (965.4 ) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock 733.0 98.4 59.9 Borrowings, net of repayments 1,131.0 1,145.0 (292.2 ) Purchase of treasury stock (117.5 )  (257.7 ) Payment of dividends (34.3 ) (24.6 ) (21.6 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 1,712.2 1,218.8 (511.6 )  Operating cash flow from continuing operations, a key source of the Companys liquidity, increased $168.5 million, or approximately 11.0% as compared to 2006. Earnings growth contributed $104.8 million to the increase in operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2007 compared to 2006, and non-cash stock compensation expense and increases in depreciation and amortization also positively impacted cash flow. Operating working capital, which the Company defines as trade accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable, was a net source of cash flow in 2007 despite higher sales levels as overall operating 41 Table of Contents working capital turns improved from the levels experienced during 2006. Operating working capital contributed $69 million to operating cash flow during 2007 as compared to $31 million contributed to operating cash flow during 2006.
As of December31, 2007, the Company held $239.1 million of cash and cash equivalents.
Acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash in all periods presented. The Company acquired 12 companies and product lines during 2007 and completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of Vision not owned as of December31, 2006, for total consideration of $3.6 billion in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash and debt acquired. The acquisition of Tektronix in November 2007 for total consideration of approximately $2.8 billion, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired, and the acquisition of ChemTreat in July 2007 for a cash purchase price of $425 million including transaction costs, constituted the largest acquisitions during the period.
During 2007, the Company completed the sale of its power quality business generating approximately $275 million of net cash proceeds.
The Company funded the purchase price of the Tektronix acquisition with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper borrowings and the net proceeds from the Companys November 2007 common stock offering, and to a lesser extent from available cash. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company refinanced a portion of the commercial paper borrowings with the net proceeds from the Companys December 2007 offering of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2018. The Company financed the ChemTreat acquisition primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from available cash.
Operating Activities The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes, pension funding decisions and other items impact reported cash flows.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations, a key source of the Companys liquidity, was approximately $1.7 billion for 2007, an increase of $169 million, or approximately 11% as compared to 2006. Earnings growth contributed $105 million to the increase in operating cash flow in 2007 compared to 2006. Operating cash flows during 2007 benefited from increases in non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of approximately $53 million compared to 2006. The increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily related to recent acquisitions. Also benefiting operating cash flows during 2007 is $68 million of non-cash acquisition related charges incurred primarily related to acquired in-process research and development activities, acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue in connection with the acquisition of Tektronix. Because this expense adversely impacts net earnings but does not require the use of cash, it positively impacts the comparison of operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings. Operating working capital contributed approximately $38 million to the increase in operating cash flow during 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase in operating working capital is primarily a result of improvements in the Companys inventory turnover and days payables outstanding in 2007. These improvements were somewhat offset by an increase in income tax payments related to continuing operations of approximately $74 million during 2007 as compared to 2006.
Investing Activities Cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash flows from divestitures of businesses or assets. Net cash used in investing activities related to continuing operations was $3.4 billion during 2007 compared to $2.8 billion of net cash used in the comparable period of 2006. Gross capital spending of $162 million for 2007 increased $26 million from $136 million during 2006, primarily due to capital spending relating to new acquisitions and increased spending related to investments in the Companys low-cost region sourcing initiatives, new products and other growth opportunities. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving 42 Table of Contents information technology systems. In 2008, the Company expects capital spending to exceed $200 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.
Net cash used in investing activities related to continuing operations was $2.8 billion in 2006 compared to approximately $965 million in 2005. Gross capital spending increased $17 million in 2006 from 2005 levels to $138 million.
As discussed below, the Company completed several business acquisitions and divestitures during 2007, 2006 and 2005. All of the acquisitions during this period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Companys financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect the competitive nature of the process by which the businesses are acquired and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses are expected to bring to existing operations. For a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see Notes 2 and 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
2007 Acquisitions and Divestiture In November 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Tektronix, Inc. for total cash consideration of approximately $2.8 billion, including transaction costs and net of cash and debt acquired. The Company funded the purchase price of the Tektronix acquisition with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper borrowings and the Companys November 2007 common stock offering (described below), and to a lesser extent from available cash. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company refinanced a portion of the commercial paper borrowings with the proceeds from the Companys December 2007 offering of the 2018 Notes (described below).
In July 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of ChemTreat for a cash purchase price of $425 million including transaction costs. No cash was acquired in the transaction. The Company financed the acquisition primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from available cash.
In addition, the Company acquired ten other companies or product lines during 2007 for consideration of approximately $273 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. Each company acquired is a manufacturer and assembler of instrumentation products, in market segments such as test and measurement, dental technologies, product identification, sensors and controls and environmental instruments. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of the Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these ten acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companys revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $123 million.
In addition to the ten acquisitions noted above, as discussed below, during the first quarter of 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of Vision not owned by the Company as of December31, 2006 for cash consideration of approximately $96 million.
In July 2007, the Company completed the sale of its power quality business generating approximately $275 million of net cash proceeds. This business, which was part of the Industrial Technologies segment and designs and manufactures power quality and reliability products and services, had aggregate annual revenues of approximately $130 million in 2006. The Company used the proceeds from this sale for general corporate purposes, including debt reduction and acquisitions.
2006 Acquisitions In May 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sybron for total cash consideration of approximately $2 billion, including transaction costs and net of $94 million of cash acquired, and assumed approximately $182 million of debt. Sybron is a leading manufacturer of a broad range of products for the dental professional and had revenues of approximately $650 million in its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition. Substantially all of the assumed debt was repaid or refinanced prior to December31, 2006. Danaher financed the acquisition of shares and the refinancing of the assumed debt primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from available cash.
43 Table of Contents In addition, in the last quarter of 2006 and first quarter of 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vision for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $525 million, including transaction costs and net of $113 million of cash acquired and assumed $1.5 million of debt. Of this purchase price, $96 million was paid during 2007 to acquire the remaining shares of Vision that the Company did not own as of December31, 2006 and for transaction costs. The Company financed the transaction through a combination of available cash and the issuance of commercial paper. Vision, based in Australia, manufactures and markets automated instruments, antibodies and biochemical reagents used for biopsy-based detection of cancer and infectious diseases, and had revenues of $86 million in its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition. The pairing of Vision with the Companys existing life science instrumentation business, Leica, has significantly broadened the Companys product offerings in the anatomical pathology market and has expanded the sales and growth opportunities for both the Leica and Vision businesses. The Company believes that the pairing of Leica and Vision has also created a broader base for the potential acquisition of complementary businesses in the life sciences industry.
Total consideration for the other nine businesses acquired during 2006 was approximately $213 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of environmental instrumentation, medical equipment or industrial products, in the market segments of test and measurement, acute care diagnostics, water quality, product identification and sensors and controls. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of the Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual revenues of these nine acquired businesses, at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the acquired companys revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $140 million.
In the first half of 2006, the Company purchased and subsequently sold shares of First Technology plc, a U.K. - based public company, in connection with the Companys unsuccessful bid to acquire First Technology. First Technology also paid the Company a break-up fee of approximately $3 million. During the second quarter of 2006 the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $14 million ($8.9 million after-tax, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share) in connection with these matters, net of related transaction costs, which is included in other expense (income), net in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings.
Disposals of fixed assets and land yielded approximately $10 million of cash proceeds during 2006 due to the sale of three parcels of real estate and miscellaneous equipment.
2005 Acquisitions In the first quarter of 2005 the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Linx Printing Technologies PLC, a publicly-held U.K based coding and marking business, for $171 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired of $2 million. Linx complements the Companys product identification businesses and had annual revenue of approximately $93 million in 2004.
In August 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of German-based Leica Microsystems AG, for an aggregate purchase price of 210million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired of 12million and the assumption and repayment at closing of 125million of outstanding Leica debt ($429 million in aggregate as of the date of the acquisition). The Company funded this acquisition and the repayment of debt assumed using available cash and through borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit totaling $222 million, which have subsequently been repaid. Leica complements the Companys medical technologies business and had annual revenues of approximately $540 million in 2004 (excluding the approximately $120 million of revenue attributable to the semiconductor business that has been divested, as described below). In September 2005, the Company also completed the sale of Leicas semiconductor equipment business which was held for sale at the time of the acquisition.
In addition to Linx and Leica, the Company acquired eleven smaller companies and product lines during 2005 for total consideration of $285 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of environmental or instrumentation products, in markets such as medical technologies, test and measurement, sensors and controls, environmental, product identification, aerospace and defense and motion. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of the Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual revenues of these 44 Table of Contents eleven acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the acquired companys revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $260 million.
In June 2005, the Company divested one insignificant business that was reported as a continuing operation within the Industrial Technologies segment for aggregate proceeds of $12.1 million in cash net of related transaction expenses. Sales related to this business included in the Companys results for 2005 were $7.5 million. Net cash proceeds received on the sale are included in Proceeds from Divestitures in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
In June 2005, the Company collected $14.6 million in full payment of a retained interest that was in the form of a $10 million note receivable and an equity interest arising from the sale of a prior business. The Company had recorded this note net of applicable allowances and had not previously recognized interest income on the note due to uncertainties associated with collection of the principal balance of the note and the related interest. Cash proceeds from the collection of the principal balance of $10 million are included in Proceeds from Divestitures in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Disposals of fixed assets yielded approximately $19 million of cash proceeds during 2005, primarily related to a sale of a building.
Financing Activities and Indebtedness Overview Financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, common stock and notes, repayments of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of $1.7 billion during 2007 compared to $1.2 billion of cash provided during 2006. The increase in cash generated from financing activities was primarily due to: commercial paper borrowings used to finance the acquisition of ChemTreat and a portion of the acquisition of Tektronix; and the proceeds from the November 2007 common stock offering and the December 2007 offering of the 2018 Notes that were used to finance the acquisition of Tektronix, in each case net of debt repayments, amounts paid for repurchases of common stock and dividends paid during 2007.
Total debt was $3,726 million at December31, 2007 compared to $2,434 million at December31, 2006. The Companys debt financing as of December31, 2007 consisted primarily of:  $240 (164 million) million of outstanding Euro denominated commercial paper;  $1,311 million of outstanding U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper;  $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.1% notes due 2008 (subject to the interest rate swaps described below);  $730 million (500 million) aggregate principal amount of 4.5% guaranteed Eurobond Notes due 2013 (Eurobond Notes);  $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2018;  $606 million of zero coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (LYONs); and  $89 million of other borrowings.
The Company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt, except as follows. Under each of the Eurobond Notes and the 2018 Notes, if the Company experiences a change of control and a rating downgrade of a specified nature within a specified period following the change of control, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of 2018 Notes, or the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of Eurobond Notes. A downgrade in the Companys credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program and credit facilities, and could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude the Companys ability to issue commercial paper. The Companys outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Companys operations and as of December31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.
45 Table of Contents Commercial Paper Program and Credit Facilities The Company satisfies its short-term liquidity needs primarily through issuances of U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper. Under the Companys U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.0 billion. Since the credit facilities described below provide credit support for the program, the $2.5 billion of availability under the credit facilities has the practical effect of reducing from $4.0 billion to $2.5 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the program. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance. Borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes, including financing acquisitions. The Company has classified $1.5 billion of the borrowings under the commercial paper program as long-term borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and the ability, as supported by the availability of the Credit Facility (described below), to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. The remaining commercial paper borrowings are classified as a current obligation.
During 2007, the Company utilized its commercial paper program, in part, to fund the acquisitions of ChemTreat and Tektronix. Operating cash flow and the proceeds from the November 2007 common stock offering, in the case of Tektronix, were also utilized to fund the acquisition. The proceeds from the December 2007 offering of the 2018 Notes were subsequently utilized to reduce outstanding borrowings under the program. As of December31, 2007, $1,551 million was outstanding under the Companys global commercial paper program, including $1,311 million outstanding under the U.S. dollar commercial paper program with a weighted average interest rate of 4.6% and an average maturity of 12 days and $240 million outstanding under the Euro-denominated commercial paper program (164 million) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1% and an average maturity of 32 days.
Credit support for part of the commercial paper program is provided by an unsecured $1.5 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) which expires on April25, 2012. The Credit Facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest is based on, at the Companys option, (1)a LIBOR-based formula is dependent in part on the Companys credit rating, or (2)a formula based on Bank of Americas prime rate or on the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (3)the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the facility. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of 0.65 to 1.00 or less.
In addition, in connection with the financing of the Tektronix acquisition in November 2007, the Company entered into a $1.9 billion unsecured revolving bridge loan facility (the Bridge Facility) which expires on November11, 2008. The Bridge Facility also provides credit support for the commercial paper program and can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest is based on, at the Companys option, either (1)a LIBOR-based formula that is dependent in part on the Companys credit rating, or (2)a formula based on the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal or on the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points. The Bridge Facility requires the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of 0.65 to 1.00 or less, and is required to be prepaid with the net cash proceeds of certain equity or debt issuances by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Together with the Companys pre-existing $1.5 billion credit facility, the Bridge Facility increased the Companys aggregate credit facilities to $3.4 billion. In December 2007, the amount of the Bridge Facility was reduced by $0.9 billion leaving the amount of the Bridge Facility at $1.0 billion and the aggregate amount of the Companys credit facilities at $2.5 billion, in each case as of December31, 2007. There were no borrowings under either the Credit Facility or the Bridge Facility during 2007.
Other Long-Term Indebtedness In December 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2018. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters discount, were approximately $493.4 million, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest plus 25 basis points.
46 Table of Contents On July21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the U.S. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were 496million ($627 million) and were used to pay down a portion of the Companys outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. The Company may redeem the notes upon the occurrence of specified, adverse changes in tax laws or interpretations under such laws, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed.
In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each of their LYONs into 14.5352 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 12.0million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January22, 2021. As of December31, 2007, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Companys option, on January22, 2011. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company for cash.
Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period from January23 to July22 and from July23 to January22 if the average market price of a LYON for a specified measurement period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% percent of the bonds average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a LYON. The Company paid approximately $1.2 million of contingent interest on the LYONs for the year ended December31, 2007. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity.
The $250 million of 6.1% notes due 2008 mature October15, 2008. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the notes having an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective net interest rate on $100 million of the Notes is the six-month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. Rates are reset twice per year. At December31, 2007, the net interest rate on $100 million of the notes was 4.43% after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreement. In accordance with SFAS No.133 (Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended), the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. These instruments qualify as effective or perfect hedges.
Shelf Registration Statement and Common Stock Offering The Company has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance.
In November 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 6.9million shares of Danaher common stock at a price to the public of $82.25 per share off the shelf registration statement. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters discount, were approximately $550 million, which were used to partially fund the acquisition of Tektronix. In December 2007, the Company also issued the 5.625% Senior Notes due 2018 off the shelf registration statement.
Stock Repurchase Program On April21, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10million shares of the Companys common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no 47 Table of Contents expiration date for the Companys repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Companys management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Companys equity compensation plans and for other corporate purposes.
During 2007, the Company repurchased 1.64million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $117 million. These repurchases were funded from available cash and from proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. During 2005, the Company repurchased 5million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at an aggregate cost of $258 million. The 2005 repurchases were funded from available cash and from borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit. At December31, 2007, the Company had approximately 3.4million shares remaining for stock repurchases under the existing Board authorization. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases using the Companys available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.
Dividends The Company increased its regular, quarterly dividend to $0.03 per share during the second quarter of 2007, and declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share payable on January25, 2008 to holders of record on December28, 2007. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2007 were $34.3 million.
Cash and Cash Requirements As of December31, 2007, the Company held $239.1 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less.
The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, fund its pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements and may borrow under existing commercial paper programs or credit facilities or access the capital markets as needed for liquidity. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy both short-term and long-term requirements.
The Companys cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside the United States. The Company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Wherever possible, cash management is centralized and intra-company financing is used to provide working capital to the Companys operations. Most of the cash balances held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States, but, under current law, would potentially be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted or prohibited by local laws. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intra-company transfer of funds, the Companys intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and it would meet United States liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company's contractual obligations as of December31, 2007 under (1)long-term debt obligations, (2)leases, (3)purchase obligations and (4)other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company's balance sheet under GAAP.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commercial commitments of the Company.

Guarantees are generally issued in connection with certain transactions with vendors, suppliers, and financing counterparties and governmental entities.
In connection with three past acquisitions, the Company has entered into agreements with the respective sellers to pay certain amounts in the future as additional purchase price. The Company enters into these types of arrangements to 49 Table of Contents help bridge differences of opinion that the Company and the sellers may have over the appropriate value of the acquired business. The Company could pay nothing in the aggregate over the next three years pursuant to these agreements, or a maximum of up to $43.8 million over the next three years depending on the performance of the respective businesses during the specified performance period.
Other Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets.In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. The Company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions.However, the Company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Due to the Companys downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
The Companys Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.
Except as described above, as of December31, 2007 the Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements and has no unconsolidated special purpose entities.
Legal Proceedings Please refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding certain outstanding litigation matters.
In addition to the litigation matters noted under Item 1. Business  Regulatory Matters  Environmental, Health& Safety, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Companys products, claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters and commercial disputes. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. While the Company maintains workers compensation, property, cargo, automobile, aviation, crime, fiduciary, product, general liability, and directors and officers liability insurance (and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) that it believes cover a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. Based upon the Companys experience, current information and applicable law, it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.
The Company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. The Company carries significant deductibles and self-insured retentions under most of its lines of insurance, and management believes that the Company maintains adequate accruals to cover the retained liability. Management determines the Companys accrual for self-insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management's discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Company believes the following critical accounting policies are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to Note 1 in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
Accounts receivable . The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. The Company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts. Estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the Companys customers, and the Company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, the Company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances, which would adversely impact the Companys net earnings and financial condition.
Inventories . The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Companys markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Companys control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Companys net earnings and financial condition.
Acquired intangibles . The Companys business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur. The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.142, the accounting standard for goodwill, which requires that the Company, on an annual basis, calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. If actual fair value is less than the Companys estimates, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.
The Companys annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of 2007, did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value for each of the Companys reporting units as of September30, 2007, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately $11 million to approximately $2.3 billion. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This 51 Table of Contents hypothetical 10% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from a short fall of approximately $10 million to an excess of approximately $2.1 billion for each of the Companys reporting units. The reporting unit that resulted in a short fall of fair value as compared to carrying value based on a 10% hypothetical change in fair value had $188 million of recorded goodwill at the date of the impairment analysis.
Long-lived assets . The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Judgments made by the Company relate to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long-lived assets, there is risk that the carrying value of the Companys long-lived assets may require adjustment in future periods. If actual fair value is less than the Companys estimates, long-lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.
Purchase accounting . In connection with its acquisitions, the Company formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination, the Company accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition, including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings. Adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized. The Company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process, the Companys experience in acquiring other companies, and information obtained after the closing about the acquired companys business, assets and liabilities. The accruals established by the Company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information on the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the uncertainty of the cost to execute the integration plans for the business. If the accruals established by the Company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to integrate the acquired entity, the Company would be required to incur an expense, which would adversely affect the net earnings. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances.
Risk Insurance .The Company carries significant deductibles and self-insured retentions with respect to various business risks. The business risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are workers' compensation and general liability (which includes product liability). For domestic workers compensation and general liability risk, the Company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses ("stop loss" insurance) and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self-insured retention. These reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by third party administrator specialists for workers' compensation and by outside risk insurance experts for product liability. In addition, outside risk experts recommend reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims by evaluating the Company's specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors. The Company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of December31, 2007 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate. If the risk insurance reserves established are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Companys net earnings.
Environmental . The Company has made a provision for environmental remediation and environmental-related personal injury claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the Company and its subsidiaries.The Company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites.If the Company determines that potential remediation liability for properties currently or previously owned is probable and reasonably estimable, it accrues the total estimated costs, including investigation and remediation costs, associated with the site.The Company also estimates its exposure for environmental-related personal injury claims and accrues for this estimated liability as such claims 52 Table of Contents become known.While the Company actively pursues insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties, it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized.The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the Companys involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations.As such, there can be no assurance that the Companys estimates of environmental liabilities will not change.Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. If the environmental reserves established by the Company are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Companys net earnings.
Contingent Liabilities . The Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of our products, claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters and commercial disputes. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and if appropriate recognizes a liability for these contingencies with the assistance of legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments or changes in the Companys settlement strategy. For a discussion of these contingencies, including management's judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, refer to Note12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Companys net earnings.
Share-Based Compensation : Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No.123R), which requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options RSUs and restricted stock, based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. SFAS No.123R supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25). The Company has adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective application method of adoption which requires the Company to record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of December31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. Awards granted after December31, 2005 are valued at fair value in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.123R. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123R, the Company recognizes equity-based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Prior to 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB 25 using the intrinsic value method, which did not require that compensation cost be recognized for the Companys stock options provided the option exercise price was established at 100% of the common stock fair market value on the date of grant.
Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share-based payment awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent managements best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, 53 Table of Contents the equity-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits : Certain of the Companys employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans (pension plans) and certain eligible retirees are provided health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans (postretirement plans). The Company accounts for its pension and postretirement plans in accordance with SFAS No.87, Employers Accounting for Pensions; SFAS No.106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions; and SFAS No.158 , Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No.87 and SFAS No.106 require that the amounts the Company records, including the expense or income, associated with the pension and postretirement plans is computed using actuarial valuations.
Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations.These include assumptions the Company makes relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions used by the Company. The assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors.While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Companys financial position or results of operations.For the United States plan, the Company used a 6.0% discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at December31, 2007, which represents an increase of 0.25% in the discount rate from December31, 2006.For non-U.S. plans, rates appropriate for each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased the US and non-US net obligation by $62 million ($40 million on an after tax basis) from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December31, 2007.
For 2007, the expected long-term rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the United States plan was estimated at 8.0% which is the same as the rate used in 2006.This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets.The U.S. plan invests between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities.The balance of the asset portfolio is invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds.Pension expense for the U.S. plan for the year ended December31, 2007 was $13 million (or $8 million on an after-tax basis), compared with $17 million (or $11 million on an after-tax basis) for this plan in 2006.If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by 0.5%, pension expense for 2007 would have increased $3.0 million (or $2.0 million on an after-tax basis).The Company made no contributions to the U.S. plan in 2007 and is not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan in 2008.The Companys non-U.S. plan assets are comprised of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan.The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 0.75% to 7.5% for 2007 and ranged from 2.5% to 6.5% for 2006.
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.158 effective in the year ended December31, 2006. For a summary of the material provisions of SFAS No.158, see New Accounting Standards. The adoption of SFAS No.158 in 2006 decreased the Companys minimum pension liability by $13.0 million ($9.1 million net of tax benefits) due to the recognition of previously unrecognized, over-funded positions in certain of the Companys non-US pension plans. The Company also recorded other comprehensive income of $10 million ($6.5 million net of tax benefits) due to the recognition of actuarially determined prior service credits associated with the Companys U.S. based retiree benefit program. As of December31, 2007, approximately $120 million ($81 million, net of tax benefits) of aggregate unrecognized prior service credits and unrecognized actuarial losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the Companys pension plans. In addition, as of December31, 2007, approximately $5.7 million ($3.9 million, net of tax) of aggregate unrecognized prior service credits and unrecognized actuarial losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the Companys postretirement plans.
54 Table of Contents The U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006 was enacted August17, 2006. While the Act will have some effect on specific plan provisions in the Companys retirement program, its primary effect will be to change the minimum funding requirements for plan years beginning in 2009. Based on initial projections, the Act is expected to slightly increase the amount of our required contributions in 2009.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No.141R) and SFAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No.160). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No.141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No.160 clarifies the classification of noncontrolling interests in the financial statements and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests. SFAS No.141R and SFAS No.160 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No.141R and SFAS No.160 on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No.157). SFAS No.157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No.157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS No.157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. Management is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS No.157 will have on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.115 (SFAS No.159). SFAS No.159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value. Under SFAS No.159, a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, equity method investments, accounts payable, guarantees and issued debt. Other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non-cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services. If the use of fair value is elected, any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred, such as debt issuance costs. The fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument-by-instrument basis, even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value. At the adoption date, unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No.159, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. SFAS No.159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. Management is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS No.159 will have on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 88, 106 and 132(R). This statement requires a company to (a)recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans over funded status or a liability for a plans under funded status (b)measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year, and (c)recognize changes in the funded status of a defined postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur (reported in comprehensive income). The requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements were effective and adopted by the Company as of the fiscal year ended December31, 2006. The requirement to measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal yearend statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2008. The adoption of this standard reduced the amount of pension and other post-retirement liabilities recorded by 55 Table of Contents approximately $23 million as of December31, 2006 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized, over-funded positions in certain of the Companys non-US pension plans and due to the recognition of actuarially determined prior service credits associated with the Companys U.S. based retiree benefit program. The Company expects to change its pension plan measurement date to December31 effective in 2008. See Pension and Other Post Retirement& Employee Benefit Plans above and Notes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No.109, to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions, including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions. The Company adopted FIN 48 as of January1, 2007, as required.As a result of the implementation, the Company recognized a decrease of $63 million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the January1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.
Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No.123 R), which requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
In November2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No.43, Chapter4." SFAS No.151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No.43, Chapter4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, SFAS No.151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No.151 was effective in the Companys first quarter of 2006. The adoption of SFAS No.151 did not have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Management on Danaher Corporations Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company completed the acquisition of Tektronix, Inc. on November21, 2007. Management considers the transaction material to Companys consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition through December31, 2007, and believes that the internal controls and procedures of Tektronix have a material effect on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Due to the close proximity of the completion date of the acquisition to the date of managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, management excluded the Tektronix business from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting.As of December31, 2007, Tektronix, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, accounted for $3.3 billion and $2.8 billion of the Companys total and net assets, respectively, and $133 million and $62 million of the Companys revenues and net loss, respectively, for the year then ended.
The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007 with the exception of the aforementioned Tektronix acquisition. In making this assessment, the Companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December31, 2007, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
The Companys independent auditors have issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. This report dated February19, 2008 appears on page 58 of this Form 10-K.
57 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Danaher Corporation: We have audited Danaher Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Danaher Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Danaher Corporations Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As indicated in the accompanying Report of Management on Danaher Corporations Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Tektronix, Inc., which was acquired in 2007 and is included in the 2007 consolidated financial statements of Danaher Corporation and constituted $3.3 billion and $2.8 billion of total and net assets, respectively, as of December31, 2007 and $133 million and $62 million of revenues and net loss, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Danaher Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Tektronix, Inc.
In our opinion, Danaher Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Danaher Corporation as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007 and our report dated February19, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
/s/ Ernst & Young LLP Baltimore, Maryland February19, 2008 58 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Danaher Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Danaher Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Danaher Corporation and subsidiaries at December31, 2007 and 2006 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123R, Share Based Payments, and adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans  an amendment of FASB Statements Nos. 87, 88, 106, and 132R. Also, as discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2007 the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No.109.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Danaher Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February19, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

63 Table of Contents (1) BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Business Danaher Corporation designs, manufactures and markets professional, medical, industrial and consumer products which are typically characterized by strong brand names, proprietary technology and major market positions in four business segments: Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies, Industrial Technologies and Tools& Components. Businesses in the Professional Instrumentation segment offer professional and technical customers various products and services that are used in connection with the performance of their work. The Professional Instrumentation segment encompasses two strategic businessestest and measurement and environmental. These businesses produce and sell desktop and compact, professional test and measurement tools and calibration equipment, a variety of video test and monitoring products, network management solutions, network diagnostic equipment and related services; water quality instrumentation and consumables and ultraviolet disinfection systems; and retail/commercial petroleum products and services, including underground storage tank leak detection and vapor recovery systems. The Medical Technologies segment includes businesses that design and manufacture acute care diagnostic instruments, high-precision optical systems for the analysis of microstructures; automated specimen preparation instruments and related reagents; and pathology diagnostic tests, including cancer diagnostics and a wide range of products used by dental professionals. Businesses in the Industrial Technologies segment manufacture products and sub-systems that are typically incorporated by customers and systems integrators into production and packaging lines and by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) into various end-products and systems. Many of the businesses also provide services to support their products, including helping customers integrate and install the products and helping ensure product uptime. The Industrial Technologies segment encompasses two strategic businesses, motion and product identification, and two focused niche businesses, aerospace and defense and sensors& controls. These businesses produce and sell product identification equipment and consumables; motion, position, speed, temperature, and level instruments and sensing devices; liquid flow and quality measuring devices; aerospace safety devices and defense articles; and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices. The Tools& Components segment is one of the largest domestic producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics hand tools. Other products manufactured by the businesses in this segment include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment; and drill chucks.
Accounting Principles The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Inventory Valuation Inventories include the costs of material, labor and overhead. Depending on the business, domestic inventories are stated at either the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO) or the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventories held outside the United States are primarily stated at the lower of cost or market using the FIFO method.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. The provision for depreciation has been computed principally by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives (3 to 35 years) of the depreciable assets.
Other Assets Other assets include principally noncurrent trade receivables, other investments, and capitalized costs associated with obtaining financings which are amortized over the term of the related debt.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments For cash and equivalents, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. For long-term debt, where quoted market prices are not available, rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of existing debt.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets result from the Companys acquisition of existing businesses. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No.142, amortization of recorded goodwill balances ceased effective January1, 2002. However, amortization of certain 64 Table of Contents identifiable intangible assets continues over the estimated useful lives of the identified asset. Refer to Notes 2 and 6 for additional information.
Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales.
Revenue Recognition As described above, the Company derives revenues primarily from the sale of professional, industrial, medical and consumer products and services. For revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition, there must be persuasive evidence of a sale, delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered, the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectibility of the balance must be reasonably assured. The Companys standard terms of sale are FOB Shipping Point and, as such, the Company principally records revenue for product sale upon shipment. If any significant obligations to the customer with respect to such sale remain to be fulfilled following shipment, typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the buyer, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. Product returns consist of estimated returns for products sold and are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale as required by SFAS No.48. Customer allowances and rebates, consisting primarily of volume discounts and other short-term incentive programs, are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the purchase price for the products purchased in accordance with EITF 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given to Vendor to a Customer (including a Reseller of a Vendors Products). Product returns, customer allowances and rebates are estimated based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to maintenance agreements is recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement as required by FASB Technical Bulletin 90-1, Accounting for Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts.
Revenues for contractual arrangements with multiple elements are allocated pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Revenues are recognized for the separate elements when the product or services have value on a stand-alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Companys control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are identifiable as those elements are also sold unaccompanied by other elements.
Research and Development The Company conducts research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products, enhancing the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of the Companys existing products and expanding the applications for which uses of the Companys products are appropriate. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Foreign Currency Translation Exchange adjustments resulting from foreign currency transactions are recognized in net earnings, whereas adjustments resulting from the translation of financial statements are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. Net foreign currency transaction gains or losses are not material in any of the years presented.
Cash and Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Refer to Note 13 for additional information.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are summarized below. Foreign currency translation adjustments are generally not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to indefinite investments in non-US subsidiaries ($ in millions).

Accounting for Stock Options As described in Note 15, effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No.123R), which requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs), based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. SFAS No.123R supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25). The Company has adopted SFAS No.123R using the modified prospective application method of adoption which requires the Company to record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of December31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. Awards granted after December31, 2005 are valued at fair value in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.123R and generally recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the service periods of each award.
Pension& Post Retirement Benefit Plans On September29, 2006, SFAS No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans was issued. SFAS No.158 requires, among other things, the recognition of the funded status of each defined benefit pension plan, retiree health care and other postretirement benefit plans and post-employment benefit plans on the balance sheet. The Company adopted SFAS 158 as of December31, 2006. See Notes 9 & 10 for additional information.
New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 18.
(2) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES: The Company has completed a number of acquisitions during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 that were either a strategic fit with an existing Company business or were of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic line of business for growth for the Company. All of these acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases and have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Companys financial statements. This goodwill arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect a number of factors including the future earnings and cash flow potential of these businesses; the multiple to earnings, cash flow and other factors at which similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers; the competitive nature of the process by which the Company acquired the business; and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing operations.
The Company makes an initial allocation of the purchase price at the date of acquisition based upon its understanding of the fair market value of the acquired assets and liabilities. The Company obtains this information during due diligence and through other sources. In the months after closing, as the Company obtains additional information about these assets and liabilities and learns more about the newly acquired business, it is able to refine the estimates 66 Table of Contents of fair market value and more accurately allocate the purchase price. Examples of factors and information that the Company uses to refine the allocations include: tangible and intangible asset appraisals; cost data related to redundant facilities; employee/personnel data related to redundant functions; product line integration and rationalization information; management capabilities; and information systems compatibilities. The only items considered for subsequent adjustment are items identified as of the acquisition date. The Company has reflected the impact of any significant pre-acquisition contingencies (as contemplated by SFAS No.38, Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises) related to its 2006 acquisitions in the final purchase price allocation for these acquisitions. The Company is continuing to evaluate certain pre-acquisition contingencies associated with certain of its 2007 acquisitions and will make appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition, as required.
The following briefly describes the Companys acquisition and divestiture activity for the three years ended December31, 2007.
In November 2007, the Company acquired Tektronix, Inc. (Tektronix) for a cash purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion including transaction costs and net of cash and debt acquired.

Under the Companys U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.0 billion. Since the credit facilities described below provide credit support for the program, the $2.5 billion of availability under the credit facilities has the practical effect of reducing from $4.0 billion to $2.5 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the program. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance. Borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes, including financing acquisitions.
During 2007, the Company utilized its commercial paper program, in part, to fund the acquisitions of ChemTreat and Tektronix. Operating cash flow and proceeds from the November 2007 underwritten common stock offering (refer to Note 15), in the case of Tektronix, were also utilized to fund the acquisitions. In December 2007, the proceeds from the offering of the 2018 Notes (described below) were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program. As of December31, 2007, U.S. dollar commercial paper borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 4.6% and an average maturity of 12 days and Euro-denominated commercial paper borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 5.1% and an average maturity of 32 days.
Credit support for part of the commercial paper program is provided by an unsecured $1.5 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) which expires on April25, 2012. The Credit Facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest is based on, at the Companys option, (1)a LIBOR-based formula that is dependent in part on the Companys credit rating, or (2)a formula based on Bank of Americas prime rate or on the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (3)the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the facility. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of 0.65 to 1.00 or less.
In addition to the Credit Facility, in connection with the financing of the Tektronix acquisition in November 2007, the Company entered into a $1.9 billion unsecured revolving bridge loan facility (the Bridge Facility) which expires on November11, 2008. The Bridge Facility also provides credit support for the commercial paper program and can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest is based on, at the Companys option, either (1)a LIBOR-based formula that is dependent in part on the Companys credit rating, or (2)a formula based on the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal or on the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points. The Bridge Facility requires the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of 0.65 to 1.00 or less, and is required to be prepaid with the net cash proceeds of certain equity or debt issuances by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Together with the Companys pre-existing $1.5 billion credit facility, the Bridge Facility temporarily increased the Companys aggregate credit facilities to $3.4 billion. In December 2007, the amount of the Bridge Facility was 76 Table of Contents reduced by $0.9 billion leaving the amount of the Bridge Facility at $1.0 billion and the aggregate amount of the Companys credit facilities at $2.5 billion, in each case as of December31, 2007. There were no borrowings under either the Credit Facility or the Bridge Facility during 2007.
The Company has classified $1.5 billion of the borrowings under the commercial paper program as long-term borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and the ability, as supported by the availability of the Credit Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date.
In December 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2018 (2018 Senior Notes). The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters discount, were approximately $493 million, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest plus 25 basis points. As of December31, 2007, the fair value of the 2018 Senior Notes approximated their carrying value.
On July21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the U.S. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were 496million ($627 million) and were used to pay down a portion of the Companys outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. The Company may redeem the notes upon the occurrence of specified, adverse changes in tax laws or interpretations under such laws, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed. As of December31, 2007, the fair value of the Eurobond Notes was approximately $700 million.
In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each of their LYONs into 14.5352 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 12.0million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January22, 2021. As of December31, 2007, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Companys option, on January22, 2011. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company for cash. As of December31, 2007, the fair value of the LYONs was approximately $1.1 billion.
Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period from January23 to July22 and from July23 to January22 if the average market price of a LYON for a specified measurement period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% percent of the bonds average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a LYON. The Company paid approximately $1.2 million of contingent interest on the LYONs for the year ended December31, 2007.
The $250 million of 6.1% notes due 2008 mature October15, 2008. The fair value of the 2008 notes, after taking into account the interest rate swaps discussed below, is approximately $255 million at December31, 2007. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the notes having an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective net interest rate on $100 million of the Notes is the six-month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. Rates are reset twice per year. At December31, 2007, the net interest rate on $100 million of the notes was 4.43% after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreement. In accordance with SFAS No.133 (Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as 77 Table of Contents amended), the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. These instruments qualify as effective or perfect hedges.
The Company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt, except as follows. Under each of the Eurobond Notes and the 2018 Notes, if the Company experiences a change of control and a rating downgrade of a specified nature within a specified period following the change of control, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of 2018 Notes, or the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of Eurobond Notes. A downgrade in the Companys credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program and credit facilities, and could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude the Companys ability to issue commercial paper. The Companys outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Companys operations and as of December31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.
The minimum principal payments during the next five years are as follows: 2008$331 million; 2009$4 million; 2010$5 million; 2011$5million, 2012$1,504million and $1,877 million thereafter.
The Company made interest payments of $95 million, $48 million and, $43 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
(9) PENSION BENEFIT PLANS: On December31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS No.158 requires the Company to recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of its pension and other postretirement plans in the December31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income at adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs, and unrecognized transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of SFAS No.87, all of which were previously netted against the plan's funded status in the Company's consolidated balance sheet pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No.87. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to the Company's historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts. Further, actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic pension cost in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. Those amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost on the same basis as the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income at adoption of SFAS No.158.
The incremental effects of adopting the provisions of SFAS No.158 on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2006 are presented in the following table for pension benefit plans (see Note 10 regarding Other Post-Retirement Employee Benefit Plans). The adoption of SFAS No.158 had no effect on the Company's consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December31, 2006, or for any prior period presented, and it will not affect the Company's operating results in future periods. Had the Company not been required to adopt SFAS No.158 at December31, 2006, it would have recognized an additional minimum pension liability pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No.87. The effect of recognizing the additional minimum liability is included in the table below in the column labeled "Prior to Adopting SFAS No.158.

The unrecognized losses and prior service costs, net, is calculated as the difference between the actuarially determined projected benefit obligation and the value of the plan assets less accrued pension costs as of September30, 2007.The prior service credits and actuarial loss included in accumulated comprehensive income and expected to be recognized in net periodic pension costs during the year ending December31, 2008 is $0.3 million ($0.2 million, net of tax) and $6.5 million ($4.4 million, net of tax), respectively. No plan assets are expected to be returned to the Company during the year ending December31, 2008.
The Company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans which cover certain of its domestic employees. Benefit accruals under most of these plans have ceased. It is the Companys policy to fund, at a minimum, amounts required by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company acquired Sybron Dental in May 2006, including its pension plans. The Company acquired Tektronix in November 2007, including its pension plans. The following sets forth the funded status of the U.S. and non-U.S. plans as of the most recent actuarial valuations using a measurement date of September30 for the plans not acquired in the Tektronix acquisition.

The Company intends on using an expected long-term rate of return assumption of 8.0% for 2008 for its U.S. plan. The expected long-term rate of return assumption for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan-by-plan basis based on the composition of assets and ranged from 0.75% to 7.5% in 2007.
Investment Policy The U.S. plans goal is to maintain between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios, which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities. Asset holdings are periodically rebalanced when equity holdings are outside this range. The balance of the asset portfolio is invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds. Non-U.S. plan assets are invested in various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan.

Included in the plan assets of the Tektronix plan are investments in real estate, absolute return funds and private equity with a value of $43 million as of the date of acquisition  November17, 2007, whose fair values have been estimated by management based upon information supplied to the Company by the fund managers or the general partners, in the absence of readily determinable market values that are available on publicly traded securities. The value of the plan assets directly affects the funded status of the Companys U.S. pension plan recorded in the financial statements.
Expected Contributions The Company was not statutorily required to make contributions to the U.S. plan for 2006 or 2007. The Company contributed $26 million to the non-U.S. plans during 2007. The Company is not required to and has no plans to make contributions to the U.S. plan in 2008. The Company expects to contribute approximately $29 million in employer contributions and unfunded benefit payments to the non-U.S. plans in 2008.
The following table sets forth benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, expected to be paid by the plans in the periods indicated.

(10) OTHER POST RETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS: In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for some of its retired employees in the United States. Certain employees may become eligible for these benefits as they reach normal retirement age while working for the Company. The following sets forth the funded status of the domestic plans as of the most recent actuarial valuations using a measurement date of September30 ($ in millions): PostRetirementMedicalBenefits 2007 2006 Change in benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 112.3 $ 105.5 Service cost 1.2 0.9 Interest cost 6.5 5.8 Amendments and other (0.3 ) (3.3 ) Actuarial loss (gain) 1.1 (7.0 ) Acquisition 20.8 19.2 Retiree contributions 1.9 2.5 Benefits paid (12.3 ) (11.3 ) Benefit obligation at end of year 131.2 112.3 Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning and end of year   Funded status (131.2 ) (112.3 ) Accrued contribution 2.9 2.3 Accrued benefit cost $ (128.3 ) $ (110.0 ) At December31, 2007, $115 million of the total underfunded status of the plan was recognized as long-term accrued post retirement liability since it is not expected to be funded within one year.

The unrecognized losses and prior service costs, net, is calculated as the difference between the actuarially determined projected benefit obligation and the value of the plan assets less accrued pension costs as of September30, 2007.The prior service credits and actuarial loss included in accumulated comprehensive income and expected to be recognized in net periodic pension costs during the year ending December31, 2008 is $7.2 million ($4.9 million, net of tax) and $3.2 million ($2.2 million, net of tax), respectively.
(11) LEASES AND COMMITMENTS: The Companys leases extend for varying periods of time up to 10 years and, in some cases, contain renewal options. Future minimum rental payments for all operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year are $100 million in 2008, $91 million in 2009, $53 million in 2010, $35 million in 2011, $30 million in 2012 and $59 million thereafter. Total rent expense charged to income for all operating leases was $103 million, $84 million and, $68 million, for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
The Company generally accrues estimated warranty costs at the time of sale. In general, manufactured products are warranted against defects in material and workmanship when properly used for their intended purpose, installed correctly, and appropriately maintained. Warranty period terms depend on the nature of the product and range from 90 days up to the life of the product. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is determined based on historical information such as past experience, product failure rates or number of units repaired, estimated cost of material and labor, and in certain instances estimated property damage. The liability, shown in the following table, is reviewed on a quarterly basis and may be adjusted as additional information regarding expected warranty costs becomes known.
In certain cases the Company will sell extended warranty or maintenance agreements. The proceeds from these agreements is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement.
The following is a rollforward of the Companys warranty accrual for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 ($ in thousands): December31, 2005 $ 92,304 Accruals for warranties issued during period 93,692 Settlements made (93,985 ) Additions due to acquisitions 5,367 Balance December31, 2006 97,378 Accruals for warranties issued during period 98,808 Changes in estimates related to pre-existing warranties 1,709 Settlements made (104,974 ) Additions due to acquisitions 17,779 Balance December31, 2007 $ 110,700 84 Table of Contents (12) LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES: Accu-Sort, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, was a defendant in a suit filed by Federal Express Corporation on May16, 2001.On March9, 2006 Accu-Sort settled the case with Federal Express for an amount which the Company believes is not material to its financial position, which amount was reflected in the Companys results of operations in 2005.The purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired Accu-Sort in 2003 provides certain indemnification for the Company with respect to this matter, and an arbitrator ordered the former owners of Accu-Sort to pay the Company a portion of the losses incurred by the Company in connection with this litigation.In April 2007, the Company received this payment from the former owners and recorded a pre-tax gain of $12 million ($7.8 million after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) which is included in Other (income) expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the year ended December31, 2007.
The Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Companys products, claims relating to intellectual property matters and claims involving employment matters and commercial disputes. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of the liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. While the Company maintains workers compensation, property, cargo, automobile, aviation, crime, fiduciary, product, general liability, and directors and officers liability insurance (and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) that it believes cover a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. Based upon the Companys experience, current information and applicable laws, it does not believe that proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
The Company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. The Company carries significant deductibles and self-insured retentions under most of its lines of insurance, and Company management believes that it maintains adequate accruals to cover the retained liability. Company management determines the accrual for self-insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.
In addition, certain of the Companys operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the United States and abroad in connection with its operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and, based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position and the Company does not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.
In addition to environmental compliance costs, the Company from time to time incurs costs related to alleged damages associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices.For example, generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist, as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority.The Company has received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and from state and non-U.S. environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of sites where the Company and others disposed of hazardous wastes require clean-up and other possible remedial action, including sites where the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations.The Company has projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities, in both the United States and abroad, to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations.The Company is also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances.
The Company has made a provision for environmental remediation and environmental-related personal injury claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the Company and its subsidiaries.The Company generally makes 85 Table of Contents an assessment of the costs involved for remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites.If the Company determines that potential remediation liability for properties currently or previously owned is probable and reasonably estimable, it accrues the total estimated costs, including investigation and remediation costs, associated with the site.The Company also estimates its exposure for environmental-related personal injury claims and accrues for this estimated liability as such claims become known.While the Company actively pursues insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties, it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realization is deemed probable and reasonably estimable.The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the Companys involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations.As such, the Company cannot assure that its estimates of environmental liabilities will not change.
In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental remediation matters and environmental-related personal injury claims based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, the Company believes that its liability related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.
The Companys Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.
As of December31, 2007, the Company had no known probable but inestimable exposures that are expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations.
(13) INCOME TAXES: The provision for income taxes from continuing operations for the years ended December31 consists of the following ($ in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Current: Federal U.S.

Long-term deferred income tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets. Deferred income taxes consist of the following ($ in thousands): 86 Table of Contents 2007 2006 Bad debt allowance $ 25,812 $ 15,377 Inventories 80,040 60,583 Property, plant and equipment (50,486 ) (37,595 ) Pension and postretirement benefits 87,921 102,471 Insurance, including selfinsurance (29,636 ) (60,126 ) Basis difference in LYONs Notes (103,768 ) (82,870 ) Goodwill and other intangibles (845,914 ) (613,491 ) Environmental and regulatory compliance 32,310 26,764 Other accruals and prepayments 194,879 168,497 Deferred service income (181,886 ) (156,644 ) Stock compensation expense 50,093 16,778 Tax credit and loss carryforwards 221,244 126,115 All other accounts 283 331 Net deferred tax liability $ (519,108 ) $ (433,810 ) Deferred taxes associated with temporary differences resulting from timing of recognition for income tax purposes of fees paid for services rendered between consolidated entities are reflected as deferred service income in the above table. These fees are fully eliminated in consolidation and have no effect on reported revenue, income or reported income tax expense.
The effective income tax rate for the years ended December31 varies from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows: PercentageofPre-taxEarnings 2007 2006 2005 Statutory federal income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Increase (decrease) in tax rate resulting from: State income taxes (net of Federal income tax benefit) 1.2 1.5 1.0 Taxes on foreign earnings (10.6 ) (8.9 ) (8.3 ) German tax credit  (1.4 )  Foreign tax credit valuation allowances  (2.4 )  In-process research and development 1.3   Research and experimentation credits and other (1.1 ) (1.4 ) (0.4 ) Effective income tax rate 25.8 % 22.4 % 27.3 % The effective tax rate for 2007 of 25.8% reflects net discrete tax benefits of approximately $21 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. New tax legislation that was signed into law in several taxing jurisdictions during 2007, most notably in Germany and Denmark, reduced income tax rates for 2008 and future periods which resulted in a reduction in the Companys deferred tax liabilities and a like reduction in 2007 income tax expense as required under SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The lower statutory rates are expected to be offset by other statutory changes in these jurisdictions, such that the Company's effective tax rate in future years will not be materially reduced as a result of the legislation. Partially offsetting the benefit from the above tax rate reduction was the effect of establishing income tax reserves during the year related to uncertain tax positions in various taxing jurisdiction, net of the reduction of tax reserves associated with Sweden as discussed below. The Companys effective income tax rate for 2006 reflects net discrete tax benefits of $69 million, or $0.21 per diluted share associated with the reduction of valuation allowances related to foreign tax credit carryforwards that are now expected to be realized, the favorable resolution of examinations of certain previously filed returns which resulted in the reduction of previously provided tax reserves and the impact of a change in German tax law which entitles the Company to cash payments in lieu of previously held unrecognized tax credits.
87 Table of Contents The Company made income tax payments of $335 million, $204 million and, $168 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $66 million, $36 million, and $15 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to the exercise of employee stock options, which vested prior to the Companys adoption of SFAS 123R and for which no expense was recognized. This benefit has been recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital.
Included in deferred income taxes as of December31, 2007 are tax benefits for U.S. and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards totaling $60 million (net of applicable valuation allowances of $149 million). Certain of the losses can be carried forward indefinitely and others can be carried forward to various dates through 2027. The recognition of any future benefit resulting from the reduction of valuation allowances established in purchase accounting will reduce goodwill of the acquired business. In addition, the Company had general business and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $96 million at December31, 2007 and also has recorded a deferred tax asset for foreign credits of $65 million related to the indirect impact of certain unrecognized tax benefits (see below).
The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January1, 2007.As a result of the implementation of Interpretation No.48, the Company recognized a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $63 million, which was accounted for as an increase to the January1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.As of the date of adoption and after the impact of recognizing the decrease in the liability noted above, the Companys gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $332 million ($254 million, net of offsetting indirect tax benefits and including $59 million associated with potential interest and penalties). As of December31, 2007, gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $475 million ($408 million, net of offsetting indirect tax benefits and including $81 million associated with potential interest and penalties). The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2007 (including accrued interest and penalties) that, if reversed, would impact the effective rate is $328 million. Unrecognized tax benefits and associated accrued interest and penalties are included in Taxes, income and other in accrued expenses as detailed in Note 7.
The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions within its global operations in income tax expense. During the year ended December31, 2007, the Company recognized approximately $24 million in potential interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions. To the extent interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding amounts accrued for potential interest and penalties, is as follows ($ in thousands): Balance January1, 2007 $ 331,701 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 35,871 Additions for tax positions of prior years 63,315 Reductions for tax position of prior years (37,075 ) Acquisitions 62,122 Lapse of statute of limitations (673 ) Settlements (2,043 ) Effect of foreign currency translation 21,889 Balance December31, 2007 $ 475,107 The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has initiated an examination of certain of the Companys federal income tax returns for the years 2004 and 2005. It is anticipated that the examination will be completed within the next twelve months. To date, the IRS has proposed, and management has agreed to certain adjustments that will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in Germany, Canada, Denmark, United Kingdom, Sweden and various other states, provinces and countries that are currently under audit for years ranging from 1997 through 2005. While the audits in Sweden are still in process, during the fourth quarter 2007, favorable court rulings in other cases resulted in the Swedish tax authority withdrawing action regarding certain of 88 Table of Contents the Companys prior year tax positions. Previously provided reserves associated with these positions were reduced and included in Reduction for tax positions of prior years in the table above.
The Company files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the United States Federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to US Federal income tax examinations for years before 2004 and is no longer subject to state, local and foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 1997.
Management estimates that it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced up to $100 million within twelve months as a result of resolution of worldwide tax matters.
The Company provides income taxes for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are not considered permanently reinvested overseas. As of December31, 2007, the approximate amount of earnings from foreign subsidiaries that the Company considers permanently reinvested and for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $5.4 billion. United States income taxes have not been provided on earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States and the amount of such taxes that may be applicable is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings.
(14) EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS): Basic EPS is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted EPS is calculated after adjusting the numerator and the denominator of the basic EPS calculation for the effect of all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Information related to the calculation of earnings from continuing operations per share of common stock is summarized as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts): For the Year Ended December31, 2007: Netearningsfrom continuingoperations (Numerator) Shares (Denominator) PerShare Amount Basic EPS $ 1,213,998 311,225 $ 3.90 Adjustment for interest on convertible debentures 10,033  Incremental shares from assumed exercise of dilutive options and RSUs  6,245 Incremental shares from assumed conversion of the convertible debentures  11,989 Diluted EPS $ 1,224,031 329,459 $ 3.72 For the Year Ended December31, 2006: Net earnings from continuing operations (Numerator) Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Basic EPS $ 1,109,206 307,984 $ 3.60 Adjustment for interest on convertible debentures 9,343  Incremental shares from assumed exercise of dilutive options and RSUs  5,229 Incremental shares from assumed conversion of the convertible debentures  12,038 Diluted EPS $ 1,118,549 325,251 $ 3.44 89 Table of Contents For the Year Ended December31, 2005: Netearningsfrom continuingoperations (Numerator) Shares (Denominator) PerShare Amount Basic EPS $ 885,609 308,905 $ 2.87 Adjustment for interest on convertible debentures 8,802  Incremental shares from assumed exercise of dilutive options and RSUs  7,040 Incremental shares from assumed conversion of the convertible debentures  12,038 Diluted EPS $ 894,411 327,983 $ 2.72 (15) STOCK TRANSACTIONS: On May15, 2007, the Companys shareholders voted to approve an amendment to Danahers Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock of Danaher to a total of one billion shares, $.01 par value. Danahers Certificate of Incorporation was amended to reflect this change on May16, 2007.
On November7, 2007, the Company completed the public offering of 6.9million shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $82.25 per share. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters discount, were $550 million. The proceeds were used, in part, to fund the acquisition of Tektronix (refer to Note 2).
On April21, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10million shares of the Companys common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date for the Companys repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Companys management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Companys existing stock plans or successor plans and for other corporate purposes.
During 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 1.6million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at an aggregate cost of $117 million. No shares were repurchased under this program in 2006. During 2005, the Company repurchased approximately 5million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at an aggregate cost of $258 million. The 2007 repurchases were funded from borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program and from available cash. The 2005 repurchases were funded from available cash and from borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit. At December31, 2007, the Company had approximately 3.4million shares remaining for stock repurchases under the existing Board authorization. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases using the Companys available cash balances, existing lines of credit or commercial paper borrowings.
Stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) have been issued to directors, officers and other management employees under the Companys Amended and Restated 1998 Stock Option Plan and the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan approved by the Companys shareholders in May 2007, and RSUs have been issued to the Companys CEO pursuant to an award approved by shareholders in 2003. No further equity awards will be issued under the 1998 Stock Option Plan. The 2007 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, restricted stock or any other stock based award. In connection with the Tektronix acquisition, the Company assumed the Tektronix 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and the Tektronix 2002 Stock Incentive Plan and assumed certain outstanding stock options, restricted stock and RSUs that had been awarded to Tektronix employees under the plans. These plans operate in a similar manner to the Companys 2007 Stock Incentive Plan. No further equity awards will be issued under the Tektronix 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and the Tektronix 2002 Stock Incentive Plan.
Stock options granted under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, the 1998 Stock Option Plan, the Tektronix 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and the Tektronix 2002 Stock Incentive Plan generally vest over a five-year period and terminate ten years from the issuance date, though the specific terms of each grant are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors (Compensation Committee). Option exercise prices for options granted by the Company under these plans equal the closing price on the NYSE of the common stock on the date of grant.Option exercise prices for the options outstanding under the Tektronix 2005 Stock Incentive plan and the Tektronix 2002 90 Table of Contents Stock Incentive Plan were based on the closing price of Tektronix common stock on the date of grant; in connection with the Companys assumption of these options, the number of shares underlying each option and exercise price of each option were adjusted to reflect the substitution of Danaher stock for the Tektronix stock underlying these awards. RSUs granted under these plans provide for the issuance of a share of the Companys common stock at no cost to the holder.They are generally subject to performance criteria determined by the Compensation Committee, as well as time-based vesting such that 50% of the RSUs granted vest (subject to satisfaction of the performance criteria) on each of the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. Prior to vesting, RSUs do not have dividend equivalent rights, do not have voting rights and the shares underlying the RSUs are not considered issued and outstanding.Shares are issued on the date the RSUs vest. Restricted shares issued under the Tektronix 2005 Stock Incentive Plan are granted subject to certain time-based vesting restrictions such that the restricted share awards are fully vested after a period of five years. Recipients of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends, whereas recipients of RSUs have no voting rights and receive no dividend equivalents. The restricted shares are considered issued and outstanding at the date the award is granted.
The options, RSUs and restricted shares generally vest only if the employee is employed by the Company on the vesting date or in other limited circumstances, and unvested options and RSUs are forfeited upon retirement before age 65 unless the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines otherwise. To cover the exercise of vested options and RSUs, the Company generally issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. At December31, 2007, approximately 9.9million shares of the Companys common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan.
Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No.123R), which requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options and RSUs, based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. SFAS No.123R supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25). The Company has adopted SFAS No.123R using the modified prospective application method of adoption which requires the Company to record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of December31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. Awards granted after December31, 2005 are valued at fair value in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.123R and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the service periods of each award. The Company estimated forfeiture rates based on its historical experience. Stock based compensation of $73 million and $67 million for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, has been recognized as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements as payroll costs of the employees receiving the rewards are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Prior to 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB 25 using the intrinsic value method, which did not require that compensation cost be recognized for the Companys stock options provided the option exercise price was established at 100% of the common stock fair market value on the date of grant. Under APB 25, the Company was required to record expense over the vesting period for the value of RSUs granted. Compensation expense related to RSU awards is calculated based on the market prices of Company common stock on the date of the grant. Prior to 2006, the Company provided pro forma disclosure amounts in accordance with SFAS No.148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure (SFAS No.148), as if the fair value method defined by SFAS No.123 had been applied to its stock-based compensation.
The estimated fair value of the options granted during 2007 and prior years was calculated using a Black-Scholes Merton option pricing model (Black-Scholes). The following summarizes the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes models for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: 91 Table of Contents YearsEndedDecember31, 2007 2006 2005 Risk-free interest rate 3.68-4.77 % 4.39-5.1 % 4.3 % Weighted average volatility 22 % 22 % 23 % Dividend yield 0.1-0.2 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Expected years until exercise 7.5-9.5 7.5-9.5 7.0 The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon U.S. government instrument over the expected term of the equity instrument. Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on the Companys stock and historical volatility of the Companys stock. The Company generally uses the midpoint between the end of the vesting period and the contractual life of the grant to estimate option exercise timing within the valuation model. This methodology is not materially different from the Companys historical data on exercise timing. Separate groups of employees that have similar behavior with regard to holding options for longer periods and different forfeiture rates are considered separately for valuation and attribution purposes.
As a result of adopting SFAS No.123R in 2006, net earnings for the year ended December31, 2007 and December31, 2006 were $39 million (net of $15 million tax benefit) and $39 million (net of $16 million benefit), respectively lower than if the Company had continued to account for stock  based compensation under APB 25. The impact on basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended December31, 2007 was $0.13 and $0.11, respectively, per share. The impact on both basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended December31, 2006 was $0.12 per share.
Pro forma net earnings as if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards are as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Net earnings as reported $ 1,369,904 $ 1,122,029 $ 897,800 Add: Stock-based compensation programs recorded as expense, net of tax 51,546 46,854 4,876 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense, net of tax (51,546 ) (46,854 ) (34,377 ) Pro forma net earnings $ 1,369,904 $ 1,122,029 $ 868,299 Earnings per share: Basic  as reported $ 4.40 $ 3.64 $ 2.91 Basic  pro forma $ 4.40 $ 3.64 $ 2.81 Diluted  as reported $ 4.19 $ 3.48 $ 2.76 Diluted  pro forma $ 4.19 $ 3.48 $ 2.67 The following table summarizes the components of the Company's stock-based compensation program recorded as expense ($ in thousands): 92 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Restricted Stock Units: Pre-tax compensation expense $ 18,708 $ 12,561 $ 7,502 Tax benefit (6,548 ) (4,396 ) (2,626 ) Restricted stock expense, net of tax $ 12,160 $ 8,165 $ 4,876 Stock Options: Pre-tax compensation expense $ 54,639 $ 54,630 $  Tax benefit (15,253 ) (15,941 )  Stock option expense, net of tax $ 39,386 $ 38,689 $  Total Share-Based Compensation: Pre-tax compensation expense $ 73,347 $ 67,191 $ 7,502 Tax benefit (21,801 ) (20,337 ) (2,626 ) Total share-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 51,546 $ 46,854 $ 4,876 As of December31, 2007, $77 million and $186 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units and stock options, respectively, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 3 years for RSUs and 2.5 years for stock options.

The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the Companys stock.
The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $201 million, $110 million and $35 million, respectively. Exercise of options during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 resulted in cash receipts of $113 million, $60 million and $38 million, respectively. The Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $66 million, $36 million, and $15 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively related to the exercise of employee stock options, which has been recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital.

SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No.141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No.160 clarifies the classification of noncontrolling interests in the financial statements and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests. SFAS No.141R and SFAS No.160 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No.141R and SFAS No.160 on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.
97 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  including an amendment of FASB Statement No.115 (SFAS No.159). SFAS No.159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value. Under SFAS No.159, a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, equity method investments, accounts payable, guarantees and issued debt. Other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non-cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services. If the use of fair value is elected, any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred, such as debt issuance costs. The fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument-by-instrument basis, even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value. At the adoption date, unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No.159, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. SFAS No.159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. Management is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS No.159 will have on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No.157). SFAS No.157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No.157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS No.157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. Management is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS No.157 will have on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None ITEM9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.Based on such evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Managements annual report on our internal control over financial reporting and the independent registered public accounting firms audit report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting are included in our financial statements for the year ended December31, 2007 included in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the headings Report of Management on Danaher Corporations Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
We completed the acquisition of Tektronix, Inc. on November21, 2007. We consider the transaction material to Companys consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition through December31, 2007, and believe that the internal controls and procedures of Tektronix have a material effect on our internal control over financial reporting. Due to the close proximity of the completion date of the acquisition to the date of managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, management excluded the Tektronix business from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting.As of December31, 2007, Tektronix, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, accounted for $3.3 billion and $2.8 billion of the Companys total and net assets, respectively, and $133 million and $62 million of the Companys revenues and net loss, respectively, for the year then ended.
There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
