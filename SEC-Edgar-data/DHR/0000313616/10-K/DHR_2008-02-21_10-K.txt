PART I ITEM 1.BUSINESS Operating Segments Danaher conducts its operations through two business segments: Process/Environmental Controls and Tools & Components. The Process/Environmental Controls segment accounted for approximately 74% of Danahers revenues in 2002 and the Tools & Components segment accounted for approximately 26% of Danahers revenues in 2002. For additional information regarding the Companys segments, please refer to Note 14 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
PROCESS/ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS The Process/Environmental Controls segment encompasses four strategic platforms (Motion, Environmental, Electronic Test, and Product Identification) and three focused niche businesses (Power Quality, Aerospace and Defense, and Industrial Controls). Process/Environmental Controls products are distributed by the Companys sales personnel and independent representatives to distributors, end-users, and original equipment manufacturers.
4 Table of Contents STRATEGIC PLATFORMS Electronic Test . The Electronic Test platform, representing approximately 20% of segment revenue in 2002, was created through the acquisition of Fluke Corporation in 1998, and has since been supplemented by various acquisitions. Fluke designs, manufactures, and markets a variety of compact professional test tools, as well as calibration equipment, for electrical, industrial, electronic, and calibration applications. These test products measure voltage, current, resistance, power quality, frequency, temperature, pressure, and other key electrical parameters.
In 2000, Fluke Networks was separated from Fluke as a stand-alone business unit. Fluke Networks provides software and hardware products used for the testing, monitoring, and analysis of local and wide area (enterprise) networks and the fiber and copper infrastructure of those networks.
The Company believes that the Fluke and Fluke Networks brand names and trade dress are well-recognized and well-regarded among targeted customers. Both Fluke and Fluke Networks are leaders in their served market segments.
Environmental . As of December 31, 2002, Environmental, representing approximately 30% of segment revenue in 2002, was Danahers largest strategic platform. The Environmental platform serves two main markets: water quality and retail/commercial petroleum.
Danahers water quality operations provide a wide range of instruments, related consumables, and services used to detect and measure chemical, physical, and microbiological parameters in drinking water, wastewater, groundwater, and ultrapure water. Typical users of these products include municipal drinking water and wastewater treatment plants, industrial process water and wastewater treatment facilities, and third-party testing laboratories. The Company is a worldwide leader in this market, providing products under a variety of well-known brands. We entered the water quality sector in 1996 and have enhanced our geographical coverage and product and service breadth through subsequent acquisitions including Dr. Lange, Hach Company, and Viridor Instrumentation, which was acquired in February 2002.
Through the Gilbarco Veeder-Root business, Danaher is a leading worldwide provider of technologies and services for the retail/commercial petroleum market. The Company designs, manufactures, and markets a wide range of products including monitoring and leak detection systems, vapor recovery equipment, fuel dispensers, point-of-sale and merchandising systems, and submersible turbine pumps. Within our target markets, we also provide remote monitoring and outsourced fuel management services, including compliance services, fuel system maintenance, and inventory planning and supply chain support. Danaher has participated in the retail/commercial petroleum market since the mid-1980s through its Veeder-Root business, and substantially enhanced its geographic coverage and product and service breadth through the recent acquisitions of Red Jacket and of Gilbarco (formerly known as Marconi Commerce Systems), which was acquired in February 2002.
Motion . Danahers Motion platform, representing approximately 20% of segment revenue in 2002, provides motors, drives, controls, mechanical components (such as ball screws, linear bearings, clutches/brakes, and linear actuators) and related products for various precision motion markets such as packaging equipment, medical equipment, robotics, circuit board assembly equipment, and electric vehicles such as lift trucks. The Company is currently one of the leading worldwide providers of precision motion control equipment. We entered the motion industry through the acquisition of Pacific Scientific Company in 1998, and have subsequently expanded our product and geographic breadth with various additional acquisitions, including American Precision Industries, Kollmorgen Corporation, the motion businesses of Warner Electric Company, and Thomson Industries, which was acquired in October 2002. Operations in the Motion platform are conducted through three divisions: General Purpose Systems, addressing general motion applications, Linear Motion Systems, addressing linear motion applications, and Specialty Motors, addressing minimotor applications.
Product Identification . The Product Identification platform, which accounted for approximately 10% of segment revenues in 2002, designs, manufactures, and markets a variety of equipment used to print bar codes, date codes, lot codes, and other tracking and marketing information on primary and secondary packaging. Typical users of these products include food and beverage manufacturers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and commercial printing and mailing operations. Danaher entered the Product Identification market through the acquisition of Videojet (formerly known as Marconi Data Systems) in February 2002. The acquisition of Willett International in January 2003, further expanded the product and geographic coverage of this platform. Today, Danaher is a leader in its served Product Identification market segments.
FOCUSED NICHE BUSINESSES Aerospace and Defense . Aerospace and Defense designs, manufactures, and markets a variety of aircraft safety equipment, including smoke detection and fire suppression systems, energetic material systems, electronic security systems, motors and actuators, and electrical power generation and management 5 Table of Contents subsystems, as well as submarine periscopes and photonic masts. These product lines came principally from the Pacific Scientific and Kollmorgen acquisitions, and are marketed under the Pacific Scientific, Sunbank, Securaplane, Kollmorgen Electro-Optical, and Calzoni brands.
Industrial Control . Danahers Industrial Control products include instruments that measure and control discrete manufacturing variables such as temperature, position, quantity, and time, as well as level and flow measurement devices for various non-water-related end-markets. These products are marketed under a variety of brands, including Dynapar, Eagle Signal, Hengstler, Partlow, Anderson, West, Dolan-Jenner, Namco, GEMS Sensors, and Setra.
Power Quality . Power Quality serves two general markets. Through the Danaher Power Solutions business, Danaher provides products such as digital static transfer switches, power distribution units, and transient voltage surge suppressors. Sold under the Cyberex, Current Technology, Joslyn and United Power brands, these products are typically incorporated within systems used to ensure high-quality, reliable power in commercial and industrial environments. Danahers other power quality businesses provide a variety of products, marketed under the Joslyn Hi-Voltage, Joslyn, Qualitrol, Jennings, and Fisher-Pierce brands, and are mainly used in power transmission and distribution systems. Customers are primarily utilities.
TOOLS & COMPONENTS The Tools & Components segment encompasses one strategic platform, Mechanics Hand Tools, and five focused niche businesses. Products are distributed by the Companys sales personnel and independent representatives to distributors, end-users, and original equipment manufacturers.
STRATEGIC PLATFORM Mechanics Hand Tools . The Mechanics Hand Tools platform, representing approximately 65% of segment revenue in 2002, encompasses two businesses: Danaher Tool Group (DTG) and Matco Tools Corporation (Matco). DTG is one of the largest worldwide producers of general purpose mechanics hand tools, primarily ratchets, sockets, and wrenches, and specialized automotive service tools for the professional and do-it-yourself markets. DTG has been the principal manufacturer of Sears, Roebuck and Co.s Craftsman  line of mechanics hand tools for over 60 years. DTG has also been the primary supplier of specialized automotive service tools to the National Automotive Parts Association (NAPA) for over 30 years, and the designated supplier of general purpose mechanics hand tools to NAPA since 1983. In addition to this private label business, Danaher also markets various products under its own brand names, including mechanics hand tools for industrial and consumer markets under the Armstrong, Allen and Sata brands, automotive service tools under the K-D Tools brand, and specialty fasteners under the Holo-Krome brand.
Matco manufactures and distributes professional automotive equipment, tools, and toolboxes through independent mobile distributors, who sell primarily to professional mechanics. The business is one of the leaders in the hand tool mobile distribution channel.
FOCUSED NICHE BUSINESSES Delta Consolidated Industries . Delta is a leading manufacturer of automotive truckboxes and industrial gang boxes, which it sells under the DELTA and JOBOX brands.
Hennessy Industries . Hennessy is a leading North American full-line wheel service equipment manufacturer, providing brake lathes, vehicle lifts, tire changers, wheel balancers, and wheel weights under the Ammco, Bada, and Coats brands.

With over 2 million engine retarders installed, JVS has maintained a leadership position in its industry since introducing the first engine retarder in 1961.
Joslyn Manufacturing Company . Joslyn Manufacturing designs, manufactures, and markets pole line hardware, electrical apparatus, and termination enclosures for the electrical utility and telecommunications markets.
The following discussions of Raw Materials, Patents/Trademarks, Competition, Seasonal Nature of Business, Backlog, Employee Relations, Research and Development, Government Contracts, Environmental and 6 Table of Contents Safety Regulations, International Operations and Major Customers include information common to both of our segments.
Raw Materials The Companys manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials. Danaher believes that it will generally be able to obtain adequate supplies of major raw material requirements or reasonable substitutes at reasonable costs.
Patents/Trademarks The Company owns numerous patents and trademarks, and has also acquired licenses under patents and trademarks owned by others. Although in aggregate the Companys intellectual property is important to its operations, the Company does not consider any single patent or trademark to be of material importance to either segment or to the business as a whole. From time to time, however, the Company does engage in litigation to protect its patents and trademarks.
Competition Our served markets are generally highly competitive and global in nature. Because of the diversity of products the Company manufactures and the variety of markets it serves, the Company encounters a wide variety of competitors. The Company faces numerous regional or specialized competitors, many of which are well-established in their markets. In addition, some of the Companys competitors are larger companies or divisions of larger companies that have greater sales, marketing, research, and financial resources than the Company. Key competitive factors typically include price, quality, delivery speed, service and support, innovation, product features and performance, and brand name.
Seasonal Nature of Business Although certain Danaher businesses experience seasonal fluctuations in demand, as a whole, the Company is not subject to material seasonality.
Backlog Backlog is generally not considered a significant factor in the Companys business as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of its products.
Employee Relations At December 31, 2002, the Company employed approximately 29,000 permanent and temporary persons, of which approximately 17,000 were employed in the United States and approximately 12,000 were employed outside the United States. Of these United States employees, approximately 3,200 were hourly-rated unionized employees. The Company also has government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements or union contracts in other countries. The Company considers its labor relations to be good.
Research and Development The Companys research and development expenditures were approximately $174 million for 2002, $119 million for 2001 and $138 million for 2000. The Company conducts research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products and services and improving existing products and services.
Government Contracts The Company has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities, primarily defense-related products and water and wastewater related products, and, as a result, is subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. The Companys agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. The Company is also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs. A failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts, administrative penalties or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.
Environmental and Safety Regulations Certain of the Companys operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the 7 Table of Contents ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the United States and abroad in connection with its operations. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and, based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
In addition to environmental compliance costs, the Company may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. For example, generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist, as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority. In addition to clean-up actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. The Company has received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and from state and foreign environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of sites where the Company and others disposed of hazardous wastes require clean-up and other possible remedial action and may be the basis for monetary sanctions, including sites where the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations. The Company has projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities, in both the United States and abroad, to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. In particular, Joslyn Manufacturing Company (JMC), a subsidiary of the Company, previously operated wood treating facilities that chemically preserved utility poles, pilings and railroad ties. All such treating operations were discontinued or sold prior to 1982. Danaher acquired JMC in September 1995. These facilities used wood preservatives that included creosote, pentachlorophenol and chromium-arsenic-copper. While preservatives were handled in accordance with then existing law, environmental law now imposes retroactive liability, in some circumstances, on persons who owned or operated wood-treating sites. JMC is remediating some of its former sites and will remediate other sites in the future.
The Company has made a provision for environmental remediation; however, there can be no assurance that estimates of environmental liabilities will not change. The Company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites. If the Company determines that it has potential liability for properties currently owned or previously sold, it accrues the total estimated costs, including investigation and remediation costs, associated with the site. While the Company actively pursues appropriate insurance recoveries, it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the Companys involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations. As such, there can be no assurance that the Companys estimates of environmental liabilities will not change. In view of the Companys financial position and reserves for environmental matters, the Company believes that its liability, if any, for past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operation, financial condition and cash flow.
International Operations The Companys net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of the Companys total net revenue, was approximately 28 percent in 2002, 31 percent in 2001 and 24 percent in 2000. The Companys long-lived assets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of the Companys total long-lived assets, was approximately 15 percent in 2002, 12 percent in 2001 and 5 percent in 2000. Most of the Companys sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries and through various representatives and distributors. However, the Company also sells into international markets directly from the U.S.
The Companys international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption in the transportation of parts to the Company and finished goods to the Companys customers, changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, unexpected changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations and differing protection of intellectual property. The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt incurred, or investment and finance receivable portfolios held. The U.S. and international response to recent terrorist activities, and the potential for war in Iraq, could exacerbate these risks. Financial information about the Companys international operations is contained in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this 8 Table of Contents report.
Major Customers The Company has no customers which accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in 2002. The Companys largest single customer is Sears, Roebuck and Co. (Sears), and although the relationship with Sears is long-standing, the Company believes the loss or material reduction of this business could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the Tools and Components segment and of the Company as a whole.
Available Information The Company maintains an internet website at www.danaher.com. The Company makes available free of charge on the website its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material electronically with, or furnishing such material to, the SEC. The Companys Internet site and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
Danaher Corporation, originally DMG, Inc., was organized in 1969 as a Massachusetts real estate investment trust. In 1978 it was reorganized as a Florida corporation under the name Diversified Mortgage Investors, Inc. (DMI) which in a second reorganization in 1980 became a subsidiary of a newly created holding company named DMG, Inc. The Company adopted the name Danaher in 1984 and was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation following the 1986 annual meeting of shareholders.
ITEM 2.PROPERTIES The Companys corporate headquarters are located in Washington, D.C. At December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately 130 significant manufacturing and distribution locations worldwide, comprising approximately 17 million square feet, of which approximately 11 million square feet are owned and approximately 6 million square feet are leased. Of these manufacturing and distribution locations, approximately 85 facilities are located in the United States and approximately 45 are located outside the United States, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia-Pacific, Canada, and Latin America. The approximate number of manufacturing and distribution locations by business segment are: Process/ Environmental Controls, 95; and Tools and Components, 35. The Company considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and does not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities.
ITEM 3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company has been engaged in product liability litigation related to an air tool product line that was disposed in 1987. The Company has accepted an agreement, in principle, to settle the claims related to this litigation. The Company believes that completion of this settlement will not result in a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or financial condition.
In addition to the litigation noted above, the Company is, from time to time, subject to routine litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Companys products, allegations of patent and trademark infringement, and litigation and administrative proceedings involving employment matters and commercial disputes. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages. The Company estimates its exposure for product liability and accrues for this estimated liability up to the limits of the deductibles under available insurance coverage. All other claims and lawsuits are handled on a case-by-case basis. As previously noted under Item 1, the Company is also involved in proceedings with respect to environmental matters, including sites where it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations. The Company believes that the results of the above-noted litigation and other pending legal proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, notwithstanding any related insurance recoveries.
ITEM 4.SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2002.

2002 2001 2000 (in thousands) Process/Environmental Controls $ 3,385,154 74.0 % $ 2,616,797 69.2 % $ 2,441,986 64.6 % Tools and Components 1,192,078 26.0 % 1,165,647 30.8 % 1,335,791 35.4 % $ 4,577,232 100.0 % $ 3,782,444 100.0 % $ 3,777,777 100.0 % PROCESS/ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS The Process/Environmental Controls segment is comprised of Hach Company, the Dr. Bruno Lange Group, Videojet Technologies, Fluke Corporation, Fluke Networks, Gilbarco, Veeder-Root Company, the Danaher Industrial Controls Group, the Danaher Motion Group (including General Purpose Systems, Linear Motion Systems and the Specialty Motors Division), Gems Sensors, Danaher Power Solutions, QualiTROL Corporation, and the aerospace and defense businesses of Pacific Scientific and Kollmorgen Corporation. These companies produce and sell compact, professional electronic test tools; product identification equipment and consumables; retail petroleum automation products; underground storage tank leak detection systems; motion, position, speed, temperature, and level instruments and sensing devices; power switches and controls; communication line products; power protection products; liquid flow and quality measuring devices; quality assurance products and systems; safety devices; and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices.
2002 COMPARED TO 2001 Sales of the Process/Environmental Controls segment increased 29% in 2002 compared to 2001. The acquisitions in February 2002 of Gilbarco and Videojet Technologies as well as several smaller 2001 and 2002 acquisitions provided a 36% increase in segment sales. This increase was offset by an 8% unit volume decline in existing businesses. A favorable currency translation impact provided a 1% revenue increase, and prices were essentially flat compared to 2001.
Revenues from the Companys environmental business, representing approximately 30% of segment revenue, increased over 90% in 2002 compared to 2001, resulting primarily from the acquisitions of Gilbarco and Viridor in February 2002 and two smaller acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2001. Acquisitions provided the entirety of this growth, as core operations declined approximately 2%. Modest growth in the Companys water quality business units was offset by weakness in demand for ultrapure instrumentation, brought on primarily by weakness in semiconductor end markets, and in Veeder-Roots leak detection market. The Company believes geopolitical uncertainties in oil-producing regions contributed to the decline in demand in the end markets served by the Gilbarco/Veeder-Root business in 2002. Electronic test revenues, representing approximately 20% of segment revenues, grew 6% during 2002, also due to acquisition activity. Acquisitions contributed 11% of this growth, which was offset by a core volume decline of 5%, resulting from weakness in both industrial and network test equipment sales. Sales in the Companys motion businesses, representing approximately 20% of segment revenues, declined 3%, as a core volume decline of 9% was offset by acquisition growth of 6%. Continued softness in semiconductor and electronic assembly end market demand was a leading factor in motions core volume decline.
11 Table of Contents Aerospace and defense revenues increased 7% in 2002, resulting from acquisition activity of 5% and core volume growth of 2%. Power quality sales declined 28% in 2002, due to a significant decline in end user demand that began in early 2001 and has continued through 2002. Sales of the Companys industrial controls product lines fell 7% due to recession-related weakness in their served end markets. In February 2002, the Company established its product identification business with the acquisition of Videojet Technologies, which accounted for approximately 11% of the segments growth during 2002.
Operating profit margins for the segment were 16.0% in 2002 compared to 14.9% in 2001. Excluding the impact of the 2001 restructuring program from both 2002 and 2001, margins decreased 0.7 points from 16.5% in 2001 to 15.8% in 2002. Approximately 130 basis points of the change in operating margin resulted from the dilutive impact of lower operating margins of the new businesses acquired during 2001 and 2002. Additionally, margin declines from lower sales volumes at the business units described above, and increases in expenditures on growth opportunities in the segment, were offset by the cessation of goodwill amortization as of January 1, 2002, and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions.
2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Sales in 2001 were 7% higher than in 2000 for this segment. The full-year impact of the 2000 acquisitions of American Precision Industries, Kollmorgen Corporation, Warner Electric Motion and acquisitions of several smaller businesses in 2001 provided a 15% increase from 2000. Two small product line dispositions in 2001 caused a 2% decrease in 2001 segment sales. The remainder of the sales change was generated by a decrease in unit volume of 5% and a 1% negative currency translation impact. Overall segment prices remained flat for 2001 compared to 2000.
Revenues from the motion business grew approximately 20% from 2000 levels. An increase of 40% from acquisitions was offset by declines in revenues from existing businesses of approximately 20%, driven by recession-related weakness in end markets, particularly semiconductor end markets. Electronic test revenues declined 1.5%. Acquisition growth of 3.5% and continued growth in sales of Fluke Networks business were offset by declines in sales of Fluke industrial products. Environmental revenues for 2001 increased 17% from 2000. 7% of this growth resulted from acquisitions, with the balance coming from core growth in the Veeder-Root and water quality product lines. The Companys aerospace and defense business units grew 39% in 2001. Acquisition growth of 30%, in particular that provided by the full-year impact of the Kollmorgen acquisition, accounted for most of the increase. Power quality revenues declined 14% in 2001, as net acquisition growth of 6% offset significant declines in end-user demand.
Operating profit margins, excluding the effects of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001, increased from 15.7% to 16.5% due to aggressive cost reduction actions across all business units and continued margin improvements in recently acquired companies.
TOOLS AND COMPONENTS The Tools and Components Segment is comprised of the Danaher Hand Tool Group (including the Special Markets, Asian Tools, Professional Tools and Matco Tools Divisions), Jacobs Chuck Manufacturing Company, Delta Consolidated Industries, Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Hennessy Industries, and the hardware and electrical apparatus lines of Joslyn Manufacturing Company. This segment is one of the largest domestic producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics hand tools. Other products manufactured by these companies include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment; drill chucks; custom-designed headed tools and components; hardware and components for the power generation and transmission industries; and high-quality precision socket screws, fasteners, and miniature precision parts.
2002 COMPARED TO 2001 Revenues in the Tools and Components segment grew 2% in 2002. The entirety of this growth represents core sales volume growth, as there were no acquisitions in this segment during 2001 and 2002, and price and currency impacts were negligible. Hand tool revenues, representing approximately 65% of segment sales, grew 2%, generated primarily by increases in the Matco sales channel as a result of continued market share gains. Additionally, hand tool revenues in the Companys Asian channels grew, but were offset by declines in domestic retail channels. Sales of diesel engine retarders at the Jacobs Vehicle Systems business unit increased significantly, as OEM customers accelerated their 2002 order rates to meet a regulatory deadline. Diesel engine retarder demand declined sharply following passage of the regulatory deadline in October 2002, and is expected to negatively impact engine retarder revenues during 2003. Increases in this segment in 2002 were offset by declines in the Delta and Jacobs Chuck business units.
Operating profit margins for the segment were 15.2% in 2002 compared to 11.3% in 2001. Excluding the impact of the 2001 restructuring program from both 2002 and 2001, margins increased 1.6 points from 13.5% in 2001 to 15.1% in 2002. This increase resulted from the effect of higher revenue levels, the cessation of goodwill amortization as of January 1, 2002, and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions.
12 Table of Contents 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Sales declined 13% from 2000 to 2001. Continued weakness in the heavy-duty truck market significantly impacted sales of diesel engine retarders, accounting for a 4% drop in segment revenues. Sharp declines in drill chuck sales combined with a fall in hand tool revenues to contribute a 6% reduction in segment sales from 2000. Sales in both the Joslyn hardware and electrical apparatus lines and the Delta Industries product lines reflected double-digit declines from the sales levels achieved by those lines in 2000 due to recessionary pressures in the markets they serve. Price and currency impacts were negligible for this segment. Operating profit margins, excluding the effects of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001, decreased from 14.2% to 13.5%. The unfavorable impact of lower production volumes was partially offset by aggressive cost reduction actions taken across all business units.
GROSS PROFIT Gross profit margin for 2002 was 39.0%, an increase of 0.8 points compared to 38.2% in 2001. This increase resulted from the benefits of the 2001 restructuring program and other improvements in the gross margins of core business units, in addition to the effect of slightly higher gross margins of newly acquired businesses.
Gross profit margin in 2001 was 38.2%, a 0.5% decrease compared to 38.7% achieved in 2000. Lower core volume and lower margins associated with businesses acquired in 2000 and 2001 drove the reduction, and were partially offset by overhead cost reductions and process improvements in all business units.
OPERATING EXPENSES In 2002, selling, general and administrative expenses were 23.8% of sales, an increase of 0.7 points from 2001 levels. This increase is due primarily to the effect of newly acquired businesses and their higher relative cost structures, offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization effective January 1, 2002.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2001 as a percentage of sales were 23.1%, 1 point lower than in 2000. Aggressive cost reductions and reductions in discretionary spending implemented in late 2000 and throughout 2001 drove this decrease.
RESTRUCTURING CHARGE In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $69.7 million ($43.5 million after tax, or $0.29 per share). During the fourth quarter of 2001, management determined that it would restructure certain of its product lines, principally its drill chuck, power quality and industrial controls divisions, to improve financial performance. The primary objective of the restructuring plan was to reduce operating costs by consolidating, eliminating and/or downsizing existing operating locations. No significant product lines have been discontinued. Severance costs for the termination of approximately 1,100 employees was estimated at $49 million. These employees include all classes of employees, including hourly direct, indirect salaried and management personnel, at the affected facilities. Approximately $16 million of the charge was to provide for impaired assets associated with the closure of 16 manufacturing and distribution facilities in North America and Europe. The assets impaired were principally equipment and leasehold improvements associated with the facilities to be closed. The remainder of the charge was for other exit costs including lease termination costs. Approximately $25.5 million of the $69.7 million charge related to the Tools and Components segments and approximately $44.2 million of the charge related to the Process/Environmental Controls segment. A table describing the application of the restructuring accrual is included in Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
The expected annual pre-tax cost reduction, net of increased costs at other facilities, from the restructuring is approximately $38 million of which approximately 50% has been realized in 2002 with the full year benefit to be realized in 2003. These net cost reductions will primarily reduce the cost of goods sold in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings. As of December 31, 2002, the restructuring program has been substantially completed as planned. While certain estimates are required in determining the net amount of cost savings achieved, based on the Companys analysis of the impact of the restructuring, management believes these net costs savings have been realized.
Due to minor changes to the original restructuring plan and to costs incurred being less than estimated, in December 2002, the Company adjusted its restructuring reserves accrued as part of the fourth quarter 2001 restructuring charge by approximately $6.3 million ($4.1 million after tax, or $0.03 per share).
In conjunction with the closing of the facilities, approximately $4 million of inventory was written off in the fourth quarter of 2001 as unusable in future operating locations. This inventory consisted principally of component parts and raw materials, which were either redundant to inventory at the 13 Table of Contents facilities being merged and/or were not economically feasible to relocate since the inventory was purchased to operate on equipment and tooling which was not being relocated. The inventory write-off was included in Cost of Sales in the fourth quarter of 2001 and was not part of the restructuring charge.
INTEREST COSTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS The Companys debt financing as of December 31, 2002 was composed primarily of $542 million of zero coupon convertible notes due 2021 (LYONs), $315 million of 6.25% Eurobond notes due 2005 and $250 million of 6% notes due 2008. The Company maintains uncommitted lines and a revolving $500 million senior unsecured credit facility available for general corporate purposes. There have been no borrowings under the revolving credit facility since it was established in June 2001. Borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear interest of Eurocurrency rate plus .21% to .70%, depending on the Companys current debt rating. The credit facility has a fixed five year term. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Companys uncommitted lines of credit as of December 31, 2002.
Net interest expense of $43.7 million in 2002 was $17.9 million higher than 2001. Returns on invested cash balances fell significantly, as general short-term market interest rates declined substantially throughout 2002. Interest income of $10.3 million and $22.4 million was recognized in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net interest expense in 2001 was $3.5 million lower than in 2000 due to an increase in interest earned as a result of higher average invested cash balances during 2001.
INCOME TAXES The 2002 effective tax rate of 34.0% is 3.5% lower than the 2001 effective rate, mainly due to the effect of adopting SFAS No. 142 and its resulting cessation of goodwill amortization, and also due to a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2002 compared to 2001.
In connection with the completion of a federal income tax audit, the Company adjusted certain income tax related reserves established related to the sale of a previously discontinued operation and recorded a $30 million credit to its fourth quarter 2002 income statement. This credit has been classified separately below net earnings from continuing operations since the tax reserves related to a previously discontinued operation.
The 2001 effective tax rate of 37.5% is 0.5% lower than in 2000, driven primarily by a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2001 compared to 2000.
INFLATION The effect of inflation on the Companys operations has been minimal in 2002, 2001 and 2000.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company manages its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities.
The fair value of the Companys fixed-rate long-term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. The value of this debt is subject to change as a result of movements in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact. Based on a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis-point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2002, the market value of the Companys fixed-rate long-term debt would decrease by $15 million. This methodology has certain limitations, and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the Companys results of operations or financial conditions under current accounting principles. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the 6% notes due 2008 having a notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective interest rate on $100 million of these notes will be the six month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. Since these instruments qualify as effective or perfect hedges, they will have no impact on net income or stockholders equity. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
The Company has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than 30 countries. As a result, it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures and sells products and services. The Companys issuance of Eurobond notes in 2000 provides an offset to a portion of the Companys European net asset position. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk.
14 Table of Contents Other than the above noted swap arrangements, there were no material derivative instrument transactions during any of the periods presented. Additionally, the Company does not have significant commodity contracts or derivatives.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing the capital structure on a short- and long-term basis. Being a key source of the Companys liquidity, operating cash flow grew $101.9 million to $710.3 million in 2002, or 16.7% during 2002 as compared to 2001. The increase in operating cash flow in 2002 over 2001 was primarily the result of higher earnings and improved working capital management. Improvements were achieved in each working capital component during 2002, driven by Danaher Business System efforts to improve asset turnover. Gross capital spending of $65.4 million for 2002 decreased $19.0 million from 2001, as increased capital spending from new acquisitions was more than offset by declines in core businesses. Capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made primarily for machinery, equipment and the improvement of facilities. In 2003, the Company expects capital spending of approximately $100 million. Disposals of fixed assets yielded $26.5 million of cash proceeds for 2002, primarily due to the sale of six facilities in 2002. A net after-tax gain of $3.9 million, approximately $.02 per share, was recorded on the facility sales and is included as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses.
In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing, and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company also measures its free cash flow. Free cash flow for 2002, which is defined as operating cash flow of $710 million less capital expenditures of $65 million, grew to a record $645 million, an increase of 23% from 2001. Free cash flow for 2001 is defined as operating cash flow of $608 million less capital expenditures of $84 million. Free cash flow provides a measurement of the cash flows from operations available for purposes other than ongoing capital expenditures.
Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, used cash of $1,145 million compared to $488 million of cash used in 2001. As discussed below, the Company has completed numerous acquisitions of existing businesses during the year ended December 31, 2002 as well as the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. All of the acquisitions during this time period have been accounted for as purchases and have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Companys financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these targets reflect the competitive nature of the process by which we acquired the targets and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these targets bring to existing operations.
On October 18, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Thomson Industries, Inc. in a stock and asset acquisition, for approximately $147 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $2 million of acquired cash), an agreement to pay $15 million over the next 6 years, and an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $60 million cash based on the future performance of Thomson through December 31, 2005. On February 25, 2002, the Company completed the divestiture of API Heat Transfer, Inc. to an affiliate of Madison Capital Partners for approximately $63 million (including $53 million in net cash and a note receivable in the principal amount of $10 million), less certain liabilities of API Heat Transfer, Inc. paid by the Company at closing and subsequent to closing. On February 5, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Data Systems, formerly known as Videojet Technologies, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $400 million in cash including transaction costs. On February 4, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Viridor Instrumentation Limited from the Pennon Group plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $137 million in cash including transaction costs. On February 1, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Commerce Systems, formerly known as Gilbarco, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $309 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $17 million of acquired cash). In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company acquired 8 smaller companies, for total consideration of approximately $166 million in cash including transaction costs.
On January 2, 2001, the Company acquired 100% of the assets of United Power Corporation for approximately $108 million in cash including transaction costs. The Company acquired 11 smaller companies during 2001 for total cash consideration of approximately $343 million including transaction costs. The Company also disposed of two small product lines during 2001, yielding cash proceeds of approximately $33 million.
On July 3, 2000, the Company acquired 100% of the assets of the motion businesses of Warner Electric Corporation for approximately $147 million cash including transaction costs. On June 20, 2000, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of Kollmorgen Corporation for approximately $267 million cash including transaction costs. The Company also assumed debt with a fair market value of approximately $95 million in connection with this acquisition. On March 27, 2000, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of American Precision Industries for approximately $186 million cash including transaction costs. The Company also assumed debt with a fair market value of approximately $60 million in connection with this acquisition. The Company acquired 5 smaller companies during 2000 for total cash 15 Table of Contents consideration of approximately $109 million including transaction costs.
Financing activities generated cash of $516 million in 2002 compared to $410 million in 2001. In March 2002, the Company completed the issuance of 6.9 million shares of the Companys common stock. Proceeds of the common stock issuance, net of the related expenses, were approximately $467 million. The Company has used the proceeds to repay approximately $230 million of short-term borrowings incurred in the first quarter of 2002 related to the Videojet, Gilbarco and Viridor acquisitions. During the first quarter of 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in zero-coupon convertible senior notes due 2021 known as Liquid Yield Option Notes or LYONS. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt, and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375%. Holders of the LYONs may convert each of their LYONs into 7.2676 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 6.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time on or after January 22, 2004. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Companys option, on January 22, 2004 or on January 22, 2011. The Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six-month period commencing after January 22, 2004 if the average market price of a LYON for a measurement period preceding such six-month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity.
Total debt under the Companys borrowing facilities increased to $1,310.0 million at December 31, 2002, compared to $1,191.7 million at December 31, 2001. This increase was due primarily to the change in the U.S dollar/Euro exchange rates and the resulting impact on the Companys Euro denominated debt as well as the effect of assumed debt obligations related to 2002 acquisitions. As discussed previously, as of December 31, 2002, $315 million of the Companys debt was fixed at a rate of 6.25%, $250 million was fixed at an average interest cost of 6% (subject to the interest rate swaps described above) and the Companys LYONs obligations (which as of December 31, 2002 amounted to $542 million) carry a yield to maturity of 2.375%(with contingent interest payable as described above). Substantially all remaining borrowings have interest costs that float with referenced base rates. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had unutilized commitments under its revolving credit facility of $500 million. As of December 31, 2002, the Company held $810 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less. As of December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the aforementioned debt instruments, including limitations on secured debt and debt levels. None of the Companys debt instruments contain trigger clauses requiring the Company to repurchase or pay off its debt if rating agencies downgrade the Companys debt rating. In addition, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company could issue up to approximately $500 million of securities under its shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the Companys 6% notes due 2008 having a notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective interest rate on $100 million of the notes will be the six month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. Since these instruments qualify as effective or perfect hedges, they will have no impact on net income or stockholders equity.
Due to declines in the equity markets, the fair value of the Companys pension fund assets has decreased since 2001. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment of $76.9 million (net of tax benefit of $39.6 million) at December 31, 2002. This adjustment results in a direct charge to stockholders equity and does not impact net income, but is included in other comprehensive income. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in such calculations. These assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. For 2003, the Company anticipates lowering the expected long-term rate of return assumption from 9% to 8.5% for the Companys defined benefit pension plans. The Company anticipates there will be no funding requirements for the defined benefit plans in 2003.
In the third and fourth quarters of 2001, the Company repurchased 375,500 shares of its common stock at a cost of $17.3 million. In the first quarter of 2000, the Company repurchased 2,042,300 shares of the Companys common stock for total consideration of $82.2 million.
The ongoing costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Companys cash flows or financial position.
16 Table of Contents The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures, and to pay interest and service debt. In order to meet these cash requirements, the Company intends to use available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under its credit facility or under uncommitted lines of credit. The Company believes that cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following tables summarize, as of December 31, 2002, and by period due or expiration of commitment, certain of the Companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments.
Payments due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 13 Years 45 Years Over 5 Years (in thousands) Long-term debt (a) $ 1,309,964 $ 112,542 $ 385,949 $ 5,792 $ 805,681 Non-cancelable operating leases (b) 261,000 54,000 78,000 56,000 73,000 Total $ 1,570,964 $ 166,542 $ 463,949 $ 61,792 $ 878,681 (a) As described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (b) As described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Other Commercial Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period TotalAmounts Committed Lessthan1 Year 13Years 45Years Over5Years (in thousands) Standby Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds $ 58,000 $ 51,000 $ 7,000   Guarantees 102,000 100,000 2,000   Contingent Purchase Consideration 60,000  10,000 10,000 40,000 Standby Repurchase Obligations 2,000 1,000 1,000   Total Commercial Commitments $ 222,000 $ 152,000 $ 20,000 $ 10,000 $ 40,000 Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Companys obligations under short-term contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture and for performance under specific manufacturing agreements. In general these commitments do not extend for more than a few months.
Guarantees reflected in the table above primarily relate to the Companys Matco subsidiary, which has sold, with recourse, or provided credit enhancements for certain of its accounts receivable and notes receivable. Amounts outstanding under this program approximated $93 million, $92 million and $70 million as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The subsidiary accounts for such sales in accordance with SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilitiesa replacement of SFAS No. 125. A provision for estimated losses as a result of the recourse has been included in accrued expenses. No gain or loss arose from these transactions.
In connection with the Companys acquisition of Thomson, the Company has entered into agreements to pay $15 million over the next 6 years, and an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $60 million cash based on the future performance of Thomson through December 31, 2005.
Aside from the sale of accounts receivable described above, the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Thomson, the leases included in the table above, and certain performance bonds and guarantees included in the table above, the Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of December 31, 2002. Also, the Company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities as of December 31, 2002.
17 Table of Contents ACCOUNTING POLICIES Managements discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect managements more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Accounts receivable . The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
Inventory . The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market. The estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the value of inventory may be required.
Acquired intangibles . The Companys business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur. The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, the new accounting standard for goodwill, which requires that the Company, on an annual basis, calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. Management judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units.
Long-lived assets . The Company periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, relying on a number of factors including operating results, budgets, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows.
Purchase accounting . In connection with its acquisitions, the Company assesses and formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity. This process begins during the due diligence process and is concluded within twelve months of the acquisition. The Company accrues estimates for certain costs, related primarily to personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings, anticipated at the date of acquisition, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. Adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances. Costs incurred in excess of the recorded accruals are expensed as incurred.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations. This statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. The Company has followed the requirements of this statement for business acquisitions made after June 30, 2001. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life not be amortized. Instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, the statement requires a test for impairment to be performed annually, or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment, measured on a reporting unit basis, could exist. The Company adopted the statement effective January 1, 2002. Danaher has nine reporting units closely aligned with the Companys strategic platforms and specialty 18 Table of Contents niche businesses. They are as follows: Tools, Motion, Electronic Test, Power Quality, Environmental, Aerospace and Defense, Industrial Controls, Level/Flow, and Product Identification.
As a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, the Company will no longer record goodwill amortization which amounted to approximately $55 million and $46 million, net of tax, in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Using the fair value measurement requirement, rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach, the Company recorded an impairment related to the Companys power quality business unit of $200 million ($173.8 million after tax), approximately 8.7% of intangible assets recorded as of January 1, 2002.
The following table provides the comparable effects of adopting of SFAS No. 142 for the two years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.
For the Years Ended December 31: 2001 2000 (inthousandsexceptearning pershareamounts) Reported Net Earnings $297,665 $324,213 Add back: Goodwill Amortization (net of tax) 54,978 45,995 Adjusted Net Earnings $352,643 $370,208 Basic Net Earnings per Share 2001 2000 Reported Net Earnings $2.07 $2.28 Add back: Goodwill Amortization (net of tax) .39 .32 Adjusted Net Earnings $2.46 $2.60 Diluted Net Earnings per Share 2001 2000 Reported Net Earnings $2.01 $2.23 Add back: Goodwill Amortization (net of tax) .36 .31 Adjusted Net Earnings $2.37 $2.54 In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company does not believe that implementation of this SFAS will have a material impact on its financial statements.
In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, which supersedes SFAS No. 121. Though it retains the basic requirements of SFAS No. 121 regarding when and how to measure an impairment loss, SFAS No. 144 provides additional implementation guidance. SFAS No. 144 applies to long-lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of, including assets under capital leases of lessees; assets subject to operating leases of lessors; and prepaid assets. SFAS No. 144 also expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a component of an entity, and eliminates the current exemption to consolidation when control over a subsidiary is likely to be temporary. This statement was effective January 1, 2002. Implementation of this SFAS did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.
In April 2002, the FASB approved SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145 rescinds previous accounting guidance, which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item. Under SFAS No. 145, classification of debt extinguishment depends on the facts and circumstances of the transaction. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The Company does not expect this SFAS to have a material impact on its financial statements.
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, rather than at the date of the entitys commitment to an exit plan. This statement is effective for exit and disposal activities that are 19 Table of Contents initiated after December 31, 2002. Since adoption of this SFAS is prospective, the Company does not believe that the implementation of this SFAS will have a material impact on its financial statements.
In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148 (FAS 148), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure which amends FASB No. 123 (FAS 123), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transition guidance and disclosure provisions of FAS 148 will be effective for the Companys financial statements issued for the first quarter of 2003. As allowed by FAS 123, the Company follows the disclosure requirements of FAS 123, but continues to account for its employee stock option plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which results in no charge to earnings when options are issued at fair market value. Therefore, at this time, adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.
In December 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires a guarantor to make additional disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements regarding the guarantors obligations. In additions, FIN 45 requires, under certain circumstances, that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken when issuing the guarantee. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.

24 Table of Contents (1)BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Business Danaher Corporation designs, manufactures and markets industrial and consumer products with strong brand names, proprietary technology and major market positions in two business segments: Process/Environmental Controls and Tools and Components. The Process/Environmental Controls segment is a leading producer of environmental products, including water quality analytical instrumentation and leak detection systems for underground fuel storage tanks; compact professional electronic test tools; product identification equipment and consumables; retail petroleum automation products; and motion, position, speed, temperature, pressure, level, flow, particulate and power reliability and quality control and safety devices. In its Tools and Components Segment, the Company is a leading producer and distributor of general purpose mechanics hand tools and automotive specialty tools, as well as of toolboxes and storage devices, diesel engine retarders, wheel service equipment, drill chucks, and hardware and components for the power generation and transmission industries.
Accounting Principles The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Inventory Valuation Inventories include material, labor and overhead and are stated principally at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO).
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. The provision for depreciation has been computed principally by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives (3 to 35 years) of the depreciable assets.
Other Assets Other assets include principally deferred income taxes, assets held for sale, noncurrent trade receivables and capitalized costs associated with obtaining financings which are amortized over the term of the related debt.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments For cash and equivalents, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. For long-term debt, rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of existing debt.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets result from the Companys acquisition of existing businesses. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142, amortization of recorded goodwill balances ceased effective January 1, 2002, however amortization of certain intangible assets continues over the estimated useful lives of the identified asset. Amortization expense for all goodwill and other intangible assets was $8,177,000, $64,705,000 and $48,586,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. See Notes 2 and 16 for additional information. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, goodwill and other intangible assets includes other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $231,000,000 and $116,000,000, respectively. Other intangible assets consist primarily of tradenames, trademarks, patents and other proprietary technology.
Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales.
Revenue Recognition The Companys standard terms of sale are FOB Shipping Point and, as such, the Company generally records revenue upon shipment and when any significant obligations to the customer have been fulfilled.
Foreign Currency Translation Exchange adjustments resulting from foreign currency transactions are generally recognized in net earnings, whereas adjustments resulting from the translation of financial statements are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. Net foreign currency transaction gains or losses are not material in any of the years presented.
Cash and Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Accumulated other comprehensive income consists of primarily cumulative foreign translation loss adjustments of $29,032,000, $69,736,000, and $59,130,000 for 2002, 25 Table of Contents 2001 and 2000, respectively and a minimum pension liability loss adjustment of $76,941,000 (net of $39,637,000 tax benefit) recorded in 2002. (See Note 9) Accounting for Stock Options As described in Note 10, the Company accounts for the issuance of stock options under the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Statement Number 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and the disclosure requirements of FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 16.
(2)ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES: The Company has completed numerous acquisitions of existing businesses during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. These acquisitions have either been completed because of their strategic fit with an existing Company business or because they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic platform for growth for the Company. All of the acquisitions during this time period have been additions to the Companys Process/Environmental Controls segment, have been accounted for as purchases and have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Companys financial statements. This goodwill arises because the purchase prices for these targets reflect a number of factors including the future earnings and cash flow potential of these target companies; the multiple to earnings, cash flow and other factors at which companies similar to the target have been purchased by other acquirers; the competitive nature of the process by which we acquired the target; and because of the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these targets bring to existing operations.
The Company makes an initial allocation of the purchase price at the date of acquisition based upon its understanding of the fair market value of the acquired assets and liabilities. The Company obtains this information during due diligence and through other sources. In the months after closing, as the Company obtains additional information about these assets and liabilities and learns more about the newly acquired business, it is able to refine the estimates of fair market value and more accurately allocate the purchase price. Examples of factors and information that we use to refine the allocations include: tangible and intangible asset appraisals; cost data related to redundant facilities; employee/personnel data related to redundant functions; product line integration and rationalization information; management capabilities; and information systems compatibilities. The only items considered for subsequent adjustment are items identified as of the acquisition date. The Companys acquisitions in 2002, 2001, and 2000 have not had any significant pre-acquisition contingencies (as contemplated by SFAS No. 38, Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises) which were expected to have a significant effect on the purchase price allocation.
The Company also periodically disposes of existing operations that are not deemed to strategically fit with its ongoing operations or are not achieving the desired return on investment. The following briefly describes the Companys acquisition and divestiture activity for the above-noted periods.
On October 18, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Thomson Industries, Inc. in a stock and asset acquisition, for approximately $147 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $2 million of acquired cash), an agreement to pay $15 million over the next 6 years, and additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $60 million cash based on the future performance of Thomson through December 31, 2005. Thomson is a leading U.S. producer of linear motion control products. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $78 million primarily related to the anticipated future earnings and cash flow potential of Thomson and its leadership in the motion industry. The future earnings and cash flow potential is expected to be enhanced through cost reduction activities as well as by potential synergies to be gained by integrating Thomsons operations with existing Danaher operations in complimentary product lines. The results of Thomsons operations have been included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings since October 18, 2002.
On February 25, 2002, the Company completed the divestiture of API Heat Transfer, Inc. to an affiliate of Madison Capital Partners for approximately $63 million (including $53 million in net cash and a note receivable in the principal amount of $10 million), less certain liabilities of API Heat Transfer, Inc. paid by the Company at closing and subsequent to closing. API Heat Transfer, Inc. was part of the Companys acquisition of American Precision Industries, Inc. and was recorded as an asset held for sale as of the time of the acquisition. No gain or loss was recognized at the time of sale.
On February 5, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Data Systems, formerly known as Videojet Technologies (Videojet), from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $400 million in cash including transaction costs. Videojet is a worldwide leader in the market for non-contact product marking equipment and consumables. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $276 million primarily related to the anticipated future earnings and cash flow potential and worldwide leadership of Videojet in the product marking equipment and consumables market. Videojet represents a new strategic platform for Danaher and was acquired in a competitive acquisition process. The results of Videojets operations have been included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings since 26 Table of Contents February 5, 2002.
On February 4, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Viridor Instrumentation Limited (Viridor) from the Pennon Group plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $137 million in cash including transaction costs. Viridor is a global leader in the design and manufacture of analytical instruments for clean water, waste water, ultrapure water and other fluids and materials. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $109 million primarily related to the anticipated future earnings and cash flow potential of Viridor and its global leadership in the area of process water instrumentation. The future earnings and cash flow potential is expected to be enhanced through cost reduction activities as well as by potential synergies to be gained by integrating Viridors operations with existing Danaher operations in complementary product lines. The results of Viridors operations have been included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings since February 4, 2002.
On February 1, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Commerce Systems, formerly known as Gilbarco (Gilbarco), from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $309 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $17 million of acquired cash).

As of December 31, 2002, the Company does not anticipate further material adjustments to the purchase price allocations of any of the above transactions with the exception of Thomson, the acquisition of which was consummated in the fourth quarter of 2002. The Company is continuing to evaluate Thomsons operations to determine the cost estimates for any integration activities to be undertaken and will adjust the estimated amounts accrued for these activities by no later than fourth quarter of 2003. The Company is also waiting on cost estimates with respect to exiting various lease obligations of Thomson which will require adjustment.
The unaudited pro forma information for the periods set forth below gives effect to the above noted acquisitions as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved had the acquisitions been consummated as of that time (unaudited, in thousands except per share amounts): 2002 2001 Net sales $ 4,868,397 $ 5,147,556 Net earnings before change in accounting principle and reversal of income tax reserves 430,521 287,760 Net earnings 286,771 287,760 Diluted earnings per share before change in accounting principle and reversal of income tax reserves 2.77 1.94 Diluted earnings per share 1.86 1.94 In connection with its acquisitions, the Company assesses and formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity. This process begins during the due diligence process and is concluded within twelve months of the acquisition. The Company accrues estimates for certain costs, related primarily to personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings, anticipated at the date of acquisition, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. Adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances. Costs incurred in excess of the recorded accruals are expensed as incurred. While the Company is still finalizing its exit plans with respect to certain of its acquisitions, it does not anticipate significant changes to the current accrual levels related to any acquisitions completed prior to the date of this report with the exception of Thomson, as indicated above.

These adjustments increased goodwill by approximately $103 million. In 2002, the Company recorded a reduction of goodwill related to these acquisitions of approximately $27 million, which had no impact on net earnings. This reduction related to reserves that were not necessary and reserves associated with facilities that were not closed due to unexpected delays in commencing certain planned integration activities. Involuntary employee termination benefits are presented as a component of the Companys compensation and benefits accrual included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. Facility closure and restructuring costs are separately reflected in other accrued expenses.
(3)RESTRUCTURING CHARGE: In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $69.7 million ($43.5 million after tax, or $0.29 per share). During the fourth quarter of 2001, management determined that it would restructure certain of its product lines, principally its drill chuck, power quality and industrial controls divisions, to improve financial performance. The primary objective of the restructuring plan was to reduce operating costs by consolidating, eliminating and/or downsizing existing operating locations. No significant product lines were discontinued. Severance costs for the termination of approximately 1,100 employees approximated $49 million. These employees included all classes of employees, including hourly direct, indirect salaried and management personnel, at the affected facilities. Approximately $16 million of the charge was to impair assets associated with the closure of 16 manufacturing and distribution facilities in North America and Europe. The assets impaired were principally equipment and leasehold improvements associated with the 16 facilities to be closed. The remainder of the charge was for other exit costs including lease termination costs. Approximately $25.5 million of the $69.7 million charge related to our Tools and Components segments and approximately $44.2 million of the charge related to our Process/Environmental Controls segment.
Due to minor changes to the original restructuring plan and to costs incurred being less than estimated, in December 2002, the Company adjusted its restructuring reserves accrued as part of the fourth quarter 2001 restructuring charge by approximately $6.3 million ($4.1 million after tax, or $0.03 per share).
In conjunction with the closing of the facilities, approximately $4 million of inventory was written off as unusable in future operating locations. This inventory consisted principally of component parts and raw materials, which were either redundant to inventory at the facilities being merged and/or were not economically feasible to relocate since the inventory was purchased to operate on equipment and tooling which was not being relocated. The inventory write-off was included in cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2001 and was not part of the restructuring charge.
The table below presents a rollforward of the activity in the restructuring accrual.

The fair value of the 2008 Notes, after taking into account the interest rate swaps discussed below, is approximately $264 million at December 31, 2002. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the notes due 2008 having a notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective net interest rate on $100 million of the Notes will be the six-month LIBOR rate plus approximately .425%. Rates are reset twice per year. At December 31, 2002, the net interest rate on $100 million of the Notes was 2.15% after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreement. In accordance with SFAS No. 133 (Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended), the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. Since these instruments qualify as effective or perfect hedges, they will have no impact on net income or stockholders equity.
The Notes due 2005 (the Eurobond Notes), with a stated amount of EU 300 million were issued in July 2000 and bear interest at 6.25% per annum. The fair value of the Eurobond Notes is approximately $331 million at December 31, 2002.
The Notes due 2003 had an original average life of approximately 10 years and an average interest cost of 7%. The carrying amount approximates fair value.
In January 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in zero-coupon convertible senior notes due 2021 known as Liquid Yield Option Notes or LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $505 million. The LYONs are convertible into approximately 6.0 million common shares of the Company, and carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each of their LYONs into 7.2676 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 6.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time on or after January 22, 2004. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Companys option, on January 22, 2004 or on January 22, 2011. The Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six-month period commencing after January 22, 2004 if the average market price of a LYON for a measurement period preceding such six-month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. Except for the contingent interest described above, the 33 Table of Contents Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity. The fair value of the LYONs notes is approximately $558 million at December 31, 2002.
The borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit are principally short-term borrowings payable upon demand. The carrying amount approximates fair value. The weighted-average interest rate for short-term borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit was 5.0% and 6.2% at December 31, 2001 and 2000. There were no outstanding amounts under uncommitted lines of credit at December 31, 2002.
The Company also has a bank credit facility which provides revolving credit through June 26, 2006, of up to $500 million. The facility provides funds for general corporate purposes at an interest rate of a Eurocurrency rate plus .21% to .70%, depending on the Companys current debt rating. There were no borrowings under bank facilities during the three years ended December 31, 2002. The Company is charged a fee of .065% to .175% per annum for the facility, depending on the Companys current debt rating. Commitment and facility fees of $406,000, $301,000 and $190,000 were incurred in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The Company has complied with all debt covenants, including limitations on secured debt and debt levels. None of the Companys debt instruments contain trigger clauses requiring the Company to repurchase or pay off its debt if rating agencies downgrade the Companys debt rating.
The minimum principal payments during the next five years are as follows: 2003 - $112,542,000; 2004 - $68,465,000; 2005 - $317,484,000; 2006 - $2,865,000; 2007 - $2,927,000; and $805,681,000 thereafter.

The following sets forth the funded status of the plans as of the most recent actuarial valuations using a measurement date of September 30 (in millions): 34 Table of Contents Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2002 2001 2002 2001 Change in benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 333.5 $ 322.5 $ 78.7 $ 67.0 Service cost 18.5 9.7 1.1 0.6 Interest cost 33.5 24.0 9.4 5.0 Amendments (14.1 )  0.5  Actuarial loss 19.9 4.1 39.9 12.7 Acquisitions 168.4  24.9  Benefits paid (33.1 ) (26.8 ) (7.5 ) (6.6 ) Benefit obligation at end of year 526.6 333.5 147.0 78.7 Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 352.7 421.5   Actual return on plan assets (45.8 ) (42.1 )   Employer contribution 0.5 0.1   Acquisition 172.6  Benefits paid (33.1 ) (26.8 )   Fair value of plan assets at end of year 446.9 352.7   Funded status (79.7 ) 19.2 (147.0 ) (78.7 ) Accrued contribution   2.0 1.7 Unrecognized transition obligation (0.3 ) (0.4 )   Unrecognized loss (gain) 175.5 61.7 36.9 (1.7 ) Unrecognized prior service cost (26.9 ) (14.8 ) 0.3 (0.9 ) Prepaid (accrued) benefit cost $ 68.6 $ 65.7 $ (107.8 ) $ (79.6 ) Weighted-average assumptions as of December 31: Discount rate 7.0 % 7.5 % 7.0 % 7.5 % Expected return on plan assets 9.0 % 10.0 %   For measurement purposes, an eleven percent and ten percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The rate was assumed to decrease to six percent by 2008 and remain at that level thereafter.

The Company acquired Kollmorgen Corporation on June 20, 2000, including their pension and postretirement benefit plans. The Company acquired American Precision Industries on March 27, 2000, including their pension plans.
35 Table of Contents Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: One-Percentage Point Increase One-Percentage Point Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components $ 1.2 $ (1.0 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 14.7 (12.7 ) Substantially all employees not covered by defined benefit plans are covered by defined contribution plans, which generally provide funding based on a percentage of compensation.
Pension expense for all plans amounted to $45,490,000, $38,002,000, and $36,555,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In addition, due to declining investment returns on the Companys plan assets, the Company recorded a $76,941,000 minimum pension liability adjustment (net of tax benefit of $39,637,000). In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded the charge as a direct adjustment to stockholders equity and thus, does not impact net income, but is included in comprehensive income. For 2003, the Company anticipates lowering the expected long-term rate of return assumption from 9% to 8.5% for the Companys defined benefit pension plans. The Company anticipates there will be no funding requirements for the defined benefit plans in 2003.
(10)STOCK TRANSACTIONS: On July 1, 2002, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to increase its authorized number of shares of common stock from 300,000,000 to 500,000,000 shares. This amendment was approved by the Companys shareholders at its May 7, 2002 annual meeting.
On March 8, 2002, the Company completed the issuance of 6.9 million shares of the Companys common stock for net proceeds to the Company of $467 million.
On March 1, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors authorized an increase in the number of common shares to be issued under the Companys non-qualified stock option plan to 22.5 million from 15.0 million. The Companys stockholders approved this increase in May 2001. Under the plan, options are granted at not less than existing market prices, expire ten years from the date of grant and generally vest ratably over a five-year period.
Changes in stock options were as follows: NumberofShares Under Option (inthousands,exceptpersharedata) Outstanding at December 31, 1999 (average $20.48 per share) 10,217 Granted (average $52.56 per share) 3,268 Exercised (average $12.95 per share) (1,615 ) Cancelled (average $23.59 per share) (1,119 ) Outstanding at December 31, 2000 (average $31.65 per share) 10,751 Granted (average $48.21 per share) 1,546 Exercised (average $14.13 per share) (1,677 ) Cancelled (average $49.17 per share) (597 ) Outstanding at December 31, 2001 (average $38.28 per share) 10,023 Granted (average $62.37 per share) 1,524 Exercised (average $22.38 per share) (1,872 ) Cancelled (average $47.24 per share) (275 ) Outstanding at December 31, 2002 (at $7.97 to $69.98 per share, average $45.09 per share) 9,400 36 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2002, options with a weighted average remaining life of 5.0 years covering 3,581,927 shares were exercisable at $7.97 to $68.31 per share (average $32.80 per share) and options covering 5,864,000 shares remain available to be granted.
Options outstanding at December 31, 2002 are summarized below: Outstanding Exercisable Exercise Price Shares (thousands) Average Exercise Price Average Remaining Life Shares (thousands) Average Exercise Price $7.97 to $11.75 397 $ 10.49 1 year 397 $ 10.49 $15.63 to $20.88 333 16.53 3 years 333 16.53 $21.25 to $32.22 1,466 25.33 4 years 1,466 25.33 $35.19 to $59.59 4,926 46.89 8 years 1,104 46.65 $60.38 to $69.98 2,278 64.11 9years 282 68.02 Nonqualified options have been issued only at fair market value exercise prices as of the date of grant during the periods presented herein, and the Companys policy does not recognize compensation costs for options of this type. The pro-forma costs of these options granted have been calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and assuming a 3.3% risk-free interest rate, a 8-year life for the option, a 33.79% expected volatility and dividends at the current annual rate. The weighted-average grant date fair market value of options issued was $28 per share in 2002, $27 per share in 2001, and $32 per share in 2000. Had this method been used in the determination of income, net earnings would have decreased by approximately $21.0 million in 2002, $20.3 million in 2001, and $17.9 million in 2000 and diluted earnings per share would have decreased by $.13 in 2002, $.13 in 2001, and $.12 in 2000. These proforma amounts may not be representative of the effects on proforma net earnings for future years.
During 2002, the Company issued approximately 400,000 shares of the Companys common stock to a former officer of the Company pursuant to a previously existing employment contract, earned in prior years. These amounts are included as a component of common stock issued for options exercised in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity.
In the third and fourth quarters of 2001, the Company repurchased 375,500 shares of the Companys common stock for total consideration of $17.3 million. In the first quarter of 2000, the Company repurchased 2,042,300 shares of the Companys common stock for total consideration of $82.2 million.
(11)LEASES AND COMMITMENTS: The Companys leases extend for varying periods of time up to 10 years and, in some cases, contain renewal options. Future minimum rental payments for all operating leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are $54,000,000 in 2003, $43,000,000 in 2004, $35,000,000 in 2005, $30,000,000 in 2006, $26,000,000 in 2007, and $73,000,000 thereafter. Total rent expense charged to income for all operating leases was $56,000,000, $42,000,000, and $35,000,000, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.
(12)LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES: Certain of the Companys operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the United States and abroad in connection with its operations. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and, based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
In addition to environmental compliance costs, the Company may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. For example, generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist, as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority. In addition to clean-up actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. The Company has received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and from state and foreign environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of sites where 37 Table of Contents the Company and others disposed of hazardous wastes require clean-up and other possible remedial action and may be the basis for monetary sanctions, including sites where the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations. The Company has projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities, in both the United States and abroad, to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. In particular, Joslyn Manufacturing Company (JMC), a subsidiary of the Company, previously operated wood treating facilities that chemically preserved utility poles, pilings and railroad ties. All such treating operations were discontinued or sold prior to 1982. These facilities used wood preservatives that included creosote, pentachlorophenol and chromium-arsenic-copper. While preservatives were handled in accordance with then existing law, environmental law now imposes retroactive liability, in some circumstances, on persons who owned or operated wood-treating sites. JMC is remediating some of its former sites and will remediate other sites in the future.
The Company has made a provision for environmental remediation; however, there can be no assurance that estimates of environmental liabilities will not change. The Company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites. If the Company determines that it has potential liability for properties currently owned or previously sold, it accrues the total estimated costs, including investigation and remediation costs, associated with the site. While the Company actively pursues appropriate insurance recoveries, it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the Companys involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations. As such, there can be no assurance that the Companys estimates of environmental liabilities will not change. In view of the Companys financial position and reserves for environmental matters, the Company believes that its liability, if any, for past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operation, financial condition and cash flow.
The Company has been engaged in product liability litigation related to an air tool product line that was disposed in 1987. The Company has accepted an agreement, in principle, to settle the claims related to this litigation. The Company believes that completion of this settlement will not result in a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or financial condition.
In addition to the litigation noted above, the Company is, from time to time, subject to routine litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Companys products, allegations of patent and trademark infringement, and litigation and administrative proceedings involving employment matters and commercial disputes. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages. The Company estimates its exposure for product liability and accrues for this estimated liability up to the limits of the deductibles under available insurance coverage. All other claims and lawsuits are handled on a case-by-case basis. The Company believes that the results of the above-noted litigation and other pending legal proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or financial condition, notwithstanding any related insurance recoveries.
The Companys Matco subsidiary has sold, with recourse, or provided credit enhancements for certain of its accounts receivable and notes receivable. Amounts outstanding under this program approximated $93 million, $92 million and $70 million as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The subsidiary accounts for such sales in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilitiesa replacement of FASB Statement No. 125. A provision for estimated losses as a result of the recourse has been included in accrued expenses. No gain or loss arose from these transactions.
As of December 31, 2002, the Company had no known probable but inestimable exposures that are expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations.
(13)INCOME TAXES: The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 consists of the following (in thousands): 38 Table of Contents 2002 2001 2000 Federal: Current $  $ 76,666 $ 85,955 Deferred 160,302 60,601 67,150 State and local 15,315 12,483 12,645 Foreign 47,710 28,849 32,961 Income tax provision $ 223,327 $ 178,599 $ 198,711 Deferred income taxes are reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets and in other assets. Deferred tax assets consist of the following (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 Bad debt allowance $ 13,394 $ 20,784 Inventories 33,207 7,929 Property, plant and equipment (32,317 ) (48,655 ) Postretirement benefits 66,823 39,053 Insurance, including selfinsurance 21,846 22,860 Basis difference in LYONs Notes (20,614 ) (9,374 ) Environmental compliance 14,667 25,239 Other accruals (26,073 ) (26,166 ) Deferred service income (126,806 ) (61,702 ) All other accounts 40,993 (25,844 ) Net deferred tax liability $ (14,880 ) $ (55,876 ) The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31 varies from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows: Percentage of Pre-tax Earnings 2002 2001 2000 Statutory federal income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Increase (decrease) in tax rate resulting from: Permanent differences in amortization of goodwill  2.9 3.1 State income taxes (net of Federal income tax benefit) 1.5 1.6 1.6 Taxes on foreign earnings (2.5 ) (2.0 ) (1.7 ) Effective income tax rate 34.0 % 37.5 % 38.0 % The Company provides income taxes for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are not considered permanently reinvested in that operation. As of December 31, 2002, the approximate amount of earnings from foreign subsidiaries that the Company considers permanently reinvested and for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $410 million. It is not practical to estimate the additional Federal income taxes, if any, that might be payable on the remittance of such earnings.
The Company made income tax payments of $98,773,000, $52,048,000 and $40,102,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $28,267,000, $12,562,000, and $9,165,000 in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, related to the exercise of employee stock options, which has been recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital.
In connection with the completion of a federal income tax audit, the Company adjusted certain income tax related reserves established related to the sale of a previously discontinued operation and recorded a $30 million credit to its fourth quarter 2002 income statement. This credit has been classified separately below net earnings from continuing operations since the tax reserves related to a previously discontinued operation.

This statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life not be amortized. Instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, the statement requires a test for impairment to be 41 Table of Contents performed annually, or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist. The Company adopted the statement effective January 1, 2002 and will no longer record goodwill amortization. The Company has recorded an impairment from the implementation of SFAS No. 142 as a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2002 of $200 million ($173.8 million after tax). The evaluation of goodwill of reporting units on a fair value basis from the implementation of SFAS No. 142, indicated that an impairment existed at the Companys power quality business unit. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, once impairment is determined at a reporting unit, SFAS No. 142 requires that the amount of goodwill impairment be determined based on what the balance of goodwill would have been if purchase accounting were applied at the date of impairment. Under SFAS No. 142, if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Once an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill will be its new accounting basis.
The following table provides the comparable effects of adoption of SFAS No. 142 for the two years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 (in thousands, except per share data).
2001 2000 Reported Net Earnings $ 297,665 $ 324,213 Add back: Goodwill Amortization (net of tax) 54,978 45,995 Adjusted Net Earnings $ 352,643 $ 370,208 Basic Earnings per Share 2001 2000 Reported Net Earnings $ 2.07 $ 2.28 Add back: Goodwill Amortization (net of tax) .39 .32 Adjusted Net Earnings per Basic Share $ 2.46 $ 2.60 Diluted Net Earnings per Share 2001 2000 Reported Net Earnings $ 2.01 $ 2.23 Add back: Goodwill Amortization (net of tax) .36 .31 Adjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share $ 2.37 $ 2.54 The carrying amount of goodwill changed by approximately $600.0 million in 2002. The components of the change were $834 million of additional goodwill associated with business combinations completed in the year ended December 31, 2002, a net decrease of $34 million in other adjustments, primarily related to adjustments to goodwill associated with acquisitions consummated in prior years and foreign currency translation adjustments, and lastly, a $200 million reduction of goodwill related to the impairment charge recorded in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142.
There were no dispositions of businesses with related goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2002. Both the acquired goodwill change in the period and the impairment charge related to the Companys Process/Environmental Controls segment. The carrying value of goodwill, at December 31, 2002, for the Tools and Components segment and Process/Environmental Controls segment is $211.9 million, and $2,564.9 million, respectively. Danaher has nine reporting units closely aligned with the Companys strategic platforms and specialty niche businesses. They are as follows: Tools, Motion, Electronic Test, Power Quality, Environmental, Aerospace and Defense, Industrial Controls, Level/Flow, and Product Identification.
The following table shows the rollforward of goodwill reflected in the financial statements resulting from the Companys acquisition activities for 2000, 2001 and 2002 (in millions).
Balance January 1, 2000 $ 1,189 Attributable to 2000 acquisitions 608 Amortization (47 ) Other Changes, including adjustments to purchase price, purchase allocations and the effect of foreign currency translations 12 Balance December 31, 2000 1,762 Attributable to 2001 acquisitions 369 Amortization (62 ) Other Changes, including adjustments to purchase price, purchase allocations and the effect of foreign currency translations 108 Balance December 31, 2001 2,177 Attributable to 2002 acquisitions 834 Other Changes, including adjustments to purchase price, purchase allocations and the effect of foreign currency translations (34 ) Write down associated with Power Quality Business (200 ) Balance December 31, 2002 $ 2,777 42 Table of Contents Included in other changes in goodwill for 2001 are changes made to the preliminary purchase price allocations made in 2000 for acquired assets and liabilities ($58.3 million) related to finalization of estimated fair market values associated with these acquisitions as well as accruals for direct costs related to exiting certain acquired operations ($53.9 million) arising from the Companys integration plan with respect to these businesses. In 2002, the Company recorded a reduction of goodwill related to certain acquisitions that occurred in 2000 of approximately $27 million related to reserves that were not necessary and reserves associated with facilities that were not closed due to unexpected delays in commencing certain planned integration activities.
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company does not believe that implementation of this SFAS will have a material impact on its financial statements.
In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, which supersedes SFAS No. 121. Though it retains the basic requirements of SFAS No. 121 regarding when and how to measure an impairment loss, SFAS No. 144 provides additional implementation guidance. SFAS No. 144 applies to long-lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of, including assets under capital leases of lessees; assets subject to operating leases of lessors; and prepaid assets. SFAS No. 144 also expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a component of an entity, and eliminates the current exemption to consolidation when control over a subsidiary is likely to be temporary. This statement was effective January 1, 2002. Implementation of this SFAS did not have a material impact on its financial statements.
In April 2002, the FASB approved SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145 rescinds previous accounting guidance, which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item. Under SFAS No. 145, classification of debt extinguishment depends on the facts and circumstances of the transaction. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The Company does not expect this SFAS to have a material impact on its financial statements.
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, rather than at the date of the entitys commitment to an exit plan. This statement is effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Since adoption of this SFAS is prospective, the Company does not believe that the implementation of this SFAS will have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.
In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148 (FAS 148), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure which amends FASB No. 123 (FAS 123), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transition guidance and disclosure provisions of FAS 148 will be effective for the Companys financial statements issued for the first quarter of 2003. As allowed by FAS 123, the Company follows the disclosure requirements of FAS 123, but continues to account for its employee stock option plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which results in no charge to earnings when options are issued at fair market value. Therefore, at this time, adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.
In December 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires a guarantor to make additional disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements regarding the guarantors obligations. In additions, FIN 45 requires, under certain circumstances, that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken when issuing the guarantee. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.
43 Table of Contents Report of Independent Auditors To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Danaher Corporation and subsidiaries We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of Danaher Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The consolidated financial statements of Danaher Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and for each of the years in the two year period then ended were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations and whose report dated January 23, 2002, (except with respect to the matters discussed in Note 17 as to which the date is March 8, 2002) expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements, prior to the disclosures related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (Statement) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, discussed in Note 16.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Danaher Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
As discussed in Note 16 to the financial statements the Company adopted Statement No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets as of January 1, 2002.
As discussed above, the financial statements of Danaher Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and for each of the years in the two year period then ended were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note 16, these financial statements have been revised to include disclosures required by Statement No. 142. Our procedures with respect to the disclosures in Note 16 included (a) agreeing the previously reported goodwill and net income to the previously issued financial statements and agreeing the changes in goodwill and the adjustments to reported net income representing amortization expense, net of tax, recognized in those periods related to goodwill to the Companys underlying records obtained from management, (b) testing the mathematical accuracy of (i) the reconciliation of adjusted net income to reported net income, and the related earnings-per-share amounts and (ii) the roll forward of goodwill balances. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001 and 2000 in Note 16 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 or 2000 financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 or 2000 financial statements taken as a whole.

Date:March28,2003 By: /s/P ATRICK W. A LLENDER Name: Title: Patrick W. Allender Executive Vice PresidentChief Financial Officer and Secretary 51 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Danaher Corporation as of December 31, 2002, and for the year then ended and have issued our report thereon dated January 29, 2003 (included elsewhere in this Form 10-K). Our audit also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15 of this Registration Statement. The schedule is the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits. The consolidated financial statements of Danaher Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and for each of the years in the two year period then ended were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations and whose report dated January 23, 2002, (except with respect to the matters discussed in Note 17 as to which the date is March 8, 2002) expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements, prior to the disclosures related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (Statement) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, discussed in Note 16.
In our opinion, the 2002 financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
