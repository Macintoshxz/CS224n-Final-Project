Business The Walt Disney Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations in five business segments: Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment, Consumer Products and Interactive Media. For convenience, the terms Company and we are used to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which our various businesses are actually conducted. On December31, 2009, the Company completed an acquisition of Marvel Entertainment, Inc. (Marvel). See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Marvel businesses are reported primarily in our Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products segments.

MEDIA NETWORKS The Media Networks segment is comprised of international and domestic cable networks and our broadcasting business, which consists of a domestic broadcast television network, television production operations, domestic and international television distribution, domestic television stations, domestic and international broadcast radio networks, domestic radio stations, and publishing and digital operations.
Cable Networks Our cable networks group operates the ESPN, Disney Channels Worldwide, ABC Family and SOAPnet networks. The cable networks group produces its own programs or acquires rights from third parties to air on our networks. The Company also has interests in joint ventures that operate programming services and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Cable networks derive a majority of their revenues from fees charged to cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers (Multi-channel Video Service Providers or MVSPs) and, for certain networks (primarily ESPN and ABC Family), the sale to advertisers of time in network programs for commercial announcements. Generally, the Companys cable networks operate under multi-year carriage agreements with MVSPs that include contractually determined fees. The amounts that we can charge to MVSPs for our cable network services are largely dependent on competition and the quality and quantity of programming that we can provide. The ability to sell time for commercial announcements and the rates received are primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that the network can deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand. We also sell programming developed by our cable networks to third parties worldwide in pay and syndication markets, in DVD format and also online to third party services.

5 Table of Contents Competition and Seasonality The Companys Media Networks businesses compete for viewers primarily with other television and cable networks, independent television stations and other media, such as DVDs, video games and the internet. With respect to the sale of advertising time, our broadcasting operations, certain of our cable networks and our television and radio stations compete with other television networks and radio stations, independent television stations, MVSPs and other advertising media such as newspapers, magazines, billboards, and the internet. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for viewers in individual market areas. A television or radio station in one market generally does not compete directly with stations in other markets.
The growth in the number of networks distributed by MVSPs has resulted in increased competitive pressures for advertising revenues for both our broadcasting and cable networks. The Companys cable networks also face competition from other cable networks for carriage by MVSPs. The Companys contractual agreements with MVSPs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Companys ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various cable programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.
The Companys Media Networks businesses also compete for the acquisition of sports and other programming. The market for programming is very competitive, particularly for sports programming. The Company currently has sports rights agreements with the National Football League (NFL), college football (including college bowl games) and basketball conferences, National Basketball Association (NBA), National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR), Major League Baseball (MLB), World Cup and various soccer leagues, and Golf and Tennis Associations.
The Companys internet web sites and digital products compete with other web sites and entertainment products in their respective categories.
Advertising revenues at the Media Networks are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. Certain affiliate revenues at ESPN are deferred until annual programming commitments are met, and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the Companys fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during this period.
Federal Regulation Television and radio broadcasting are subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under federal laws and regulations, including the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary forfeitures, limited renewals of licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license. FCC regulations that affect our Media Networks segment include the following:  Licensing of television and radio stations.
Each of the television and radio stations we own must be licensed by the FCC. These licenses are granted for periods of up to eight years, and we must obtain renewal of licenses as they expire in order to continue operating the stations. We (or the acquiring entity in the case of a divestiture) must also obtain FCC approval whenever we seek to have a license transferred in connection with the acquisition or divestiture of a station. The FCC may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances. Although we have generally received such renewals and approvals in the past, there can be no assurance that we will always obtain necessary renewals and approvals in the future.
Television and radio station ownership limits.
The FCC imposes limitations on the number of television stations and radio stations we can own in a specific market, on the combined number of television and radio stations we can own in a single market and on the aggregate percentage of the national audience that can be reached by television stations we own. Currently:  FCC regulations may restrict our ability to own more than one television station in a market, depending on the size and nature of the market. We do not own more than one television station in any of the markets in which we own a television station.
Federal statutes permit our television stations in the aggregate to reach a maximum of 39% of the national audience (for this purpose, FCC regulations attribute to UHF television stations only 50% of the television households in their market). For purposes of the FCCs rules, our eight stations reach approximately 21% of the national audience.
FCC regulations in some cases impose restrictions on our ability to acquire additional radio or television stations in the markets in which we own radio stations, but we do not believe any such limitations are material to our current operating plans.
6 Table of Contents  Dual networks.
FCC rules currently prohibit any of the four major television networks  ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC  from being under common ownership or control.
Regulation of programming.
The FCC regulates broadcast programming by, among other things, banning indecent programming, regulating political advertising and imposing commercial time limits during childrens programming. Broadcasters face a heightened risk of being found in violation of the indecency prohibition by the FCC because of recent FCC decisions, coupled with the spontaneity of live programming. In the past several years, the FCC increased enforcement activities with respect to indecency, and a number of significant indecency cases against various broadcasters remain pending in the courts. Moreover, the penalties for broadcasting indecent programming are a maximum of $325,000 per violation.
Federal legislation and FCC rules also limit the amount of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast or cable channels during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger. In addition, broadcast channels are generally required to provide a minimum of three hours per week of programming that has as a significant purpose meeting the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also give television station owners the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance.
Cable and satellite carriage of broadcast television stations.
With respect to cable systems operating within a television stations Designated Market Area, FCC rules require that every three years each television station elect either must carry status, pursuant to which cable operators generally must carry a local television station in the stations market, or retransmission consent status, pursuant to which the cable operator must negotiate with the television station to obtain the consent of the television station prior to carrying its signal. Under the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act and its successors, including most recently the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act (STELA), which also requires the must carry or retransmission consent election, satellite carriers are permitted to retransmit a local television stations signal into its local market with the consent of the local television station. Under must carry, if a satellite carrier elects to carry one local station in a market, the satellite carrier must carry the signals of all local television stations that also request carriage.
Digital television.
Pursuant to FCC regulations, all of the Companys stations now operate exclusively on digital channels.
Cable and satellite carriage of programming.
The Communications Act and FCC rules regulate some aspects of negotiations regarding cable and satellite retransmission consent, and some cable and satellite companies have sought regulation of additional aspects of the carriage of programming on cable and satellite systems. Litigation has been instituted against the Company, other program providers and distributors seeking among other things to achieve similar ends. New legislation, court action or regulation in this area could, depending on its specific nature, have an impact on the Companys operations.
The foregoing is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and other legislation and of specific FCC rules and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, other legislation, FCC rules and public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of the FCCs regulatory authority.
FCC laws and regulations are subject to change, and the Company generally cannot predict whether new legislation, court action or regulations, or a change in the extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations, would have an adverse impact on our operations.

Walt Disney Imagineering Walt Disney Imagineering provides master planning, real estate development, attraction, entertainment and show design, engineering support, production support, project management and other development services, including research and development for the Companys operations.
Competition and Seasonality The Companys theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, and weather patterns and natural disasters.
All of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, the theme parks and resorts business experiences fluctuations in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and local entertainment excursions. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods.
STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT The Studio Entertainment segment produces and acquires live-action and animated motion pictures, direct-to-video content, musical recordings and live stage plays.
The Company distributes produced and acquired films (including its film and television library) in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets with a focus on Disney-branded films under the Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar banners and Marvel-branded films. The Company also distributes films under the Touchstone Pictures banner. Each of the market windows is discussed in more detail below.
In August 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with DreamWorks Studios (DreamWorks) to distribute live-action motion pictures produced by DreamWorks over the next seven years under the Touchstone Pictures banner. Under the agreement, the Company distributed I Am Number Four, The Help and Fright Night in fiscal 2011. As part of the agreement, the Company provides certain financing, which as of October1, 2011, totaled $153 million. There is an additional $90 million available that is largely dependent on DreamWorks obtaining additional equity financing.
Prior to the Companys acquisition, Marvel had agreements in place for third party studios to distribute its films including Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America and The Incredible Hulk , which have all been released. Under these arrangements, the Company incurs the cost to produce the films and pays the third party studio a distribution fee. Beginning with The Avengers , which is scheduled for release in May 2012, the Company will distribute all Marvel produced films. In fiscal 2011, the Company purchased the distribution rights for The Avengers and Iron Man 3 from a third party studio and will pay certain fees to that studio associated with the performance of those films, subject to a minimum guarantee.
The Company has also licensed the rights to produce and distribute feature films for certain other Marvel properties including Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four, and X-Men to third-party studios. Under these licensing arrangements, the third-party studio incurs the cost to produce and distribute the films and pays the Company a licensing fee. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company completed a two-way transaction to simplify our relationship with Sony Pictures. In this transaction, the Company purchased Sony Pictures participation in Spider-Man merchandising, while at the same time, Sony Pictures purchased from the Company our participation in Spider-Man films. This transaction will allow the Company to control and fully benefit from all Spider-Man merchandising activity, while Sony Pictures will continue to produce and distribute Spider-Man films.
On December3, 2010, the Company sold Miramax Film NY, LLC (Miramax), which was one of its banners, for $663 million. Net proceeds which reflect closing adjustments, the settlement of related claims and obligations and Miramaxs cash balances at closing totaled $532 million. The sale included both Miramax and Dimension film assets.
12 Table of Contents Theatrical Market We generally produce and distribute live-action family films and full length animated films. During fiscal 2012, we expect to distribute domestically seven of our own produced feature films and four DreamWorks films. As of October1, 2011, the Company had released domestically approximately 970 full-length live-action features, 90 full-length animated features, 550 cartoon shorts and 50 live action shorts.
We distribute and market our filmed products principally through our own distribution and marketing companies in the U.S. theatrical market. In the international theatrical markets, we distribute our filmed products both directly and through independent distribution companies or joint ventures. Films released theatrically in the U.S. may be released simultaneously in international territories or generally up to four months later.
The Company incurs significant marketing and advertising costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film in an effort to generate public awareness of the film, to increase the publics intent to view the film and to help generate consumer interest in the subsequent home entertainment and other ancillary markets. These costs are expensed as incurred; therefore, we typically incur losses on a film in the theatrical markets, including in periods prior to the theatrical release of the film.
Home Entertainment Market In the domestic market, we distribute home entertainment releases directly under each of our motion picture banners. In the international market, we distribute home entertainment releases under each of our motion picture banners both directly and through independent foreign distribution companies. In addition, we acquire and produce original content for direct-to-video release.
Domestic and international home entertainment distribution typically starts three to six months after the theatrical release in each market. The home entertainment releases may be distributed in both physical (DVD and Blu-Ray) and electronic versions. Most titles are sold simultaneously to retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Best Buy, and also Redbox and Netflix.
As of October1, 2011, we had approximately 1,700 active produced and acquired titles, including 1,300 live-action titles and 400 animated titles, in the domestic home entertainment marketplace and approximately 2,900 active produced and acquired titles, including 2,400 live-action titles and 500 animated titles, in the international marketplace.
Television Market Pay-Per-View (PPV)/Video-on-Demand (VOD): Concurrently with, or up to two months after, home entertainment distribution begins, we license titles for use on a PPV/VOD basis, as well as for internet, console games, and mobile platforms. PPV/VOD services deliver one-time rentals electronically to consumers at a price comparable to that of physical media rentals.
Pay Television (Pay 1): There are generally two pay television windows. The first window is generally sixteen months in duration and follows the PPV/VOD window. The Company has licensed exclusive domestic pay television rights to substantially all films released under the Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar, and Touchstone Pictures banners to the Starz pay television service through fiscal 2016. DreamWorks titles distributed by the Company are licensed to Showtime under a separate agreement.
Free Television (Free 1): The Pay 1 window is followed by a television window with telecasts accessible to consumers without charge. This free window may last up to 84 months. Motion pictures are usually sold in the Free 1 window on an ad-hoc basis to major networks, including the ABC Television Network, and basic cable services.
Pay Television 2 (Pay 2) and Free Television 2 (Free 2): In the U.S., Free 1 is generally followed by a fourteen-month Pay 2 window under our license arrangements with Starz and Showtime, and finally by a Free 2 window. Major packages of the Companys feature films have been licensed for broadcast under multi-year agreements within the Free 2 window. The Free 2 window is a syndication window where films are licensed both to basic cable networks and to third-party television station groups.
International Television: The Company also licenses its theatrical properties outside of the U.S. The typical windowing sequence is broadly consistent with the domestic cycle such that titles premiere on television in PPV/VOD then air in pay TV before airing in free TV. Windowing strategies are developed in response to local market practices and conditions, and the exact sequence and length of each window can vary country by country.
13 Table of Contents Disney Music Group The Disney Music Group includes Walt Disney Records, Hollywood Records (including the Mammoth Records and Buena Vista Records labels), Lyric Street Records, Buena Vista Concerts and Disney Music Publishing.

Disney On Ice s newest ice shows, Dare to Dream and Treasure Trove, launched in September and October 2011, respectively, for North America tours and Phineas and Ferb: The Greatest Live Tour Ever , the latest from Disney Live!, was launched in August 2011.
Competition and Seasonality The Studio Entertainment businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television films, exploit products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television programming services and sponsor live theater. We also compete to obtain creative and performing talents, story properties, advertiser support and broadcast rights that are essential to the success of our Studio Entertainment businesses.
The success of Studio Entertainment operations is heavily dependent upon public taste and preferences. In addition, Studio Entertainment operating results fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.
CONSUMER PRODUCTS The Consumer Products segment engages with licensees, manufacturers, publishers and retailers throughout the world to design, develop, publish, promote and sell a wide variety of products based on existing and new characters and other Company intellectual property through its Merchandise Licensing, Publishing and Retail businesses.

The Company currently owns and operates 208 stores in North America, 103 stores in Europe, and 46 stores in Japan.
Competition and Seasonality The Companys merchandise licensing, publishing and retail businesses compete with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names. Based on independent surveys, we believe the Company is the largest worldwide licensor of character-based merchandise based on retail sales. Operating results for the licensing and retail businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of animated theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts.
INTERACTIVE MEDIA The Interactive Media Group creates and delivers branded entertainment and lifestyle content across interactive media platforms. The primary operating businesses of the Interactive Media Group are Games which produces multi-platform games for global distribution, and Online, which produces internet websites in the United States and internationally.

Competition and Seasonality The Companys online sites and products compete with a wide variety of other online sites and products. The Companys video game business competes primarily with other publishers of video game software and other types of home entertainment. Operating results for the video game business fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases, which are determined by several factors including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts, competition and the timing of holiday periods. Revenues from certain of the Companys online and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends.

ITEM1A.
Risk Factors For an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: Changes in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses.
A decline in economic activity in the United States and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. The most recent decline in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of Company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. A decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts or prices that MVSPs pay for our cable programming. Recent instability in European economies presents risks of similar impacts in our European operations. Economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-United States markets, or reduce the United States dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets.
16 Table of Contents Changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.
Our businesses create entertainment, travel or consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. Many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the United States, and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the United States. Moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, electronic games, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. If our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film receipts or home video or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses.
Changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products or the cost of producing or distributing products.
The media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate depend significantly on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and exploit new technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. In addition, new technologies affect the demand for our products, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired markets. For example, the success of our offerings in the home entertainment market depends in part on consumer preferences with respect to home entertainment formats, including DVD players and personal video recorders, as well as the availability of alternative home entertainment offerings and technologies, including web-based delivery of entertainment offerings. In addition, technological developments offer consumers an expanding array of entertainment options and delivery vehicles which may include options we have not yet fully developed, or options we have developed but which entail a smaller return than we realize on traditional options. As a result, the income from our entertainment offerings may decline or increase at slower rates than our historical experience or our expectations when we make investments in products.
The success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create.
The value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the United States and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase.
The unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. New technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, and increased broadband internet speed and penetration have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. There is evidence that unauthorized use of intellectual property rights in the entertainment industry generally is a significant and rapidly growing phenomenon. Inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the Companys operations worldwide, despite the Companys efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. These developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed digital distribution of our content and sales of unauthorized DVDs, Blu-ray discs and other products.
With respect to intellectual property developed by the Company and rights acquired by the Company from others, the Company is subject to the risk of challenges to our rights in intellectual property by third parties. Successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights. The Company is not aware of any challenges to its intellectual property rights that it currently foresees having a material effect on its operations.
17 Table of Contents Protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation.
We maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. If our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. If personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident.
A variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services.
Demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. The environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the United States, globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. For example, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011 resulted in a period of suspension of our operations and those of certain of our licensees in Japan, including Tokyo Disney Resort and resulted in a loss of revenue from those operations. These events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. In addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the Company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. A wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, that could adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. We obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and liability for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. When insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits of liability. The types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss.
Changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses.
As changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. In addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macro-economic conditions may impair the value of our assets. When these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. We also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. In recent years, such investments have included investments in new cruise ships, expansion and repurposing of certain of our theme park attractions, and development of a resort facility in Hawaii. In addition, a joint venture in which we participate recently began construction of a theme park in Shanghai, China. Some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. In any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring.
18 Table of Contents Turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments.
Past disruptions in the U.S. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, equity markets have recently experienced rapid and wide fluctuations in value. These conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on the Companys performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. Past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. A similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs and could affect our ability to settle existing contracts.
Increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs.
We face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. We also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:  Our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home video products and internet usage.
Our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, and the internet, as well as with newspapers, magazines and billboards.
Our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.
Our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks.
Our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities.
Our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.
Our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and publishing businesses compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share.
Our consumer products segment competes in the character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, and retail activities with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names.
Our interactive game operations compete with other publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment.
Competition in each of these areas may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. Such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues. Competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services.
19 Table of Contents Sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability.
With approximately 156,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. We may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. In addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. These macro-economic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and post retirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and post retirement medical benefits and may increase future funding contributions. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses.
Our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms.
We enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to MVSPs. As these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the revenue from distribution of programs may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than our historical experience). With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. There can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming.
Changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses.
Our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of United States and overseas regulations. These regulations include:  United States FCC regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. See Item1  Business  Media Networks, Federal Regulation.
Environmental protection regulations.
Federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations.
Regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations.
Imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas.
Domestic and international tax laws or currency controls.
Changes in any of these regulatory areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable.
Our operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions.
Our operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than United States law. Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the United States, and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under United States law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-United States jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if United States law governed these operations.
20 Table of Contents Labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.
A significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. In addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. In general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs.
Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to shareholders.
Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings and authorizes our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. The regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the Company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. The issuance of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control. In addition, provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation require supermajority shareholder approval of some acquisition transactions and we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, either of which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances.
The seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations.
Each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows:  Revenues in our Media Networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. In general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. Certain affiliate revenues at ESPN are deferred until annual programming commitments are met, and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the Companys fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during this period.
Revenues in our Parks and Resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and local entertainment excursions. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods.
Revenues in our Studio Entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment, and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.
Revenues in our Consumer Products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts.
Revenues in our Interactive Media segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases which are determined by several factors, including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts, competition and the timing of holiday periods. Revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends.
Accordingly, if a short term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year.

Legal Proceedings Celador International Ltd. v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.
On May19, 2004, an affiliate of the creator and licensor of the television program, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, filed an action against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. and Buena Vista Television, LLC, alleging it was damaged by defendants improperly engaging in certain intra-company transactions and charging merchandise distribution expenses, resulting in an underpayment to the plaintiff.On July7, 2010, the jury returned a verdict for breach of contract againstcertain subsidiaries of the Company, awarding plaintiff damages of $269.4 million.The Company has stipulated with the plaintiff to an award of prejudgment interest of $50 million, which amount will be reduced pro rata should the Court of Appeals reduce the damages amount. On December21, 2010, the Companys alternative motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law were denied. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, the Company believes the jurys verdict is in error and is vigorously pursuing its position on appeal, notice of which was filed by the Company on January14, 2011. On or about January28, 2011, plaintiff filed a notice of cross-appeal. The Company has determined that it does not have a probable loss under the applicable accounting standard relating to probability of loss for recording a reserve with respect to this litigation and therefore has not recorded a reserve.
The Company, together with, in some instances, certain of its directors and officers, is a defendant or codefendant in various other legal actions involving copyright, breach of contract and various other claims incident to the conduct of its businesses. Management does not expect the Company to suffer any material liability by reason of these actions.

It includes the following sections:  Consolidated Results  Business Segment Results  2011 vs. 2010  Non-Segment Items  2011 vs. 2010  Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefit Costs  Business Segment Results  2010 vs. 2009  Non-Segment Items  2010 vs. 2009  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Contractual Obligations, Commitments, and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  Accounting Policies and Estimates  Accounting Changes  Forward-Looking Statements CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2011 vs. 2010 Revenues for fiscal 2011 increased 7%, or $2.8 billion, to $40.9 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 21%, or $844 million, to $4.8 billion; and diluted earnings per share attributable to Disney (EPS) increased 24% to $2.52.
Net income attributable to Disney for fiscal 2011 included $55 million of restructuring and impairment charges and gains from the sales of businesses of $75 million. The table below shows the pretax and after tax impact of these items.
Benefit / (Expense) Pretax Tax Effect After Tax Restructuring and impairment charges $ (55) $ 47 $ (8) Gains on sales of businesses 75 (107) (32) $ 20 $ (60) $ (40) Restructuring and impairment charges include an impairment of assets that had tax basis significantly in excess of book value resulting in a $47 million tax benefit on the restructuring and impairment charges. The gains on sales of businesses included the sale of Miramax which had a book value that included $217 million of allocated goodwill which is not tax deductible. Accordingly, the taxable gain on the sales of businesses exceeded the $75 million book gain resulting in tax expense of $107 million. These items collectively had a $0.02 negative impact on EPS compared to the items in fiscal 2010 that are discussed below which had a net adverse impact of $0.04 on EPS.
The increase in EPS for fiscal 2011 reflected higher operating results driven by higher revenues from MVSPs (Affiliate Fees) at our Cable Networks, increased guest spending and volumes at our domestic parks and resorts, higher advertising revenue at ESPN, lower film cost write-downs, decreased programming and production costs at the ABC Television Network, higher licensing revenue due to the strength of Cars merchandise and a full-period of results for Marvel, and higher equity income at AETN/Lifetime. These increases were partially offset by higher costs at ESPN and at our domestic parks and resorts, lower performance at our theatrical business, and the inclusion of a full-period of results for Playdom in the current year, which included the impact of acquisition accounting.
27 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Revenues for fiscal 2010 increased 5%, or $1.9 billion, to $38.1 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 20%, or $656 million, to $4.0 billion; and EPS increased 15% to $2.03.
Net income attributable to Disney for fiscal 2010 included restructuring and impairment charges ($0.09 per diluted share), gains on the sales of investments in two television services in Europe ($0.02 per diluted share), a gain on the sale of the Power Rangers property ($0.01 per diluted share), and an accounting gain related to the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan ($0.01 per diluted share), which, including the impact of rounding, collectively had a net adverse impact of $0.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2009 included restructuring and impairment charges ($0.17 per diluted share), a non-cash gain in connection with the merger of Lifetime and AETN ($0.08 per diluted share) and a gain on the sale of our investment in two pay television services in Latin America ($0.04 per diluted share). Including the impact of rounding, these items collectively resulted in a net adverse impact of $0.06 per diluted share. Fiscal 2009 results also include an additional week of operations due to our fiscal period end.
The increase in EPS for fiscal 2010 reflected higher operating results due to higher Affiliate Fees at our Cable Networks, increased advertising revenues at our cable and broadcast businesses, the strong worldwide theatrical performance of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2 , and lower distribution and marketing costs at our home entertainment business, partially offset by higher costs at our cable business and at our domestic parks and resorts operations.
Restructuring and Impairment Charges The Company recorded $55 million of charges in fiscal 2011 reflecting severance and facilities costs related to organizational and cost structure initiatives primarily at the Studio Entertainment and Interactive Media segments.
The Company recorded $270 million of charges in fiscal 2010 related to organizational and cost structure initiatives primarily at our Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments. Restructuring charges of $138 million were primarily for severance and other related costs. Impairment charges of $132 million consisted of write-offs of capitalized costs primarily related to abandoned film projects, the closure of a studio production facility and the closure of five ESPN Zone locations.
The Company recorded charges totaling $492 million in fiscal 2009 which included impairment charges of $279 million and restructuring costs of $213 million. The most significant of the impairment charges were $142 million related to FCC radio licenses and $65 million related to our investment in UTV. The restructuring charges included severance and other related costs as a result of organizational and cost structure initiatives across our businesses.

Higher advertising revenues were due to an increase of $471 million at Cable Networks from $3,051 million to $3,522 million and an increase of $99 million at Broadcasting from $3,977 million to $4,076 million. The increase at Cable Networks of 14% was due to higher rates. The increase at Broadcasting reflected increases of 6% due to higher Network advertising rates, primarily at primetime, and 1% due to higher local television advertising, partially offset by a decrease of 4% due to lower Network ratings primarily at primetime and daytime.
The increase in other revenues was driven by a change in the transfer pricing arrangement between Studio Entertainment and Media Networks for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and higher sales of Disney Channel programming, partially offset by lower sales of ABC Studios productions driven by no new seasons of Lost and Ghost Whisperer .
Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include programming and production costs which increased $249 million from $8,453 million to $8,702 million. At Cable Networks, an increase in programming and production spending of $457 million was driven by higher sports rights costs due to the addition of college football programming including Bowl Championship Series games, increased contractual costs for college and professional sports programming and more episodes of original programming at the Disney Channels, partially offset by the absence of programming costs for the FIFA World Cup which was broadcast in the prior year. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs decreased $208 million reflecting lower news and daytime production costs due to cost savings initiatives, a lower cost mix of programming in primetime due to a shift of hours from original scripted programming to reality programming, a shift of college sports programming to ESPN and lower production cost amortization due to a decrease in sales of ABC Studios productions. Operating expenses also reflected a 2% increase due to a change in the transfer pricing arrangement for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and a 1% increase due to higher labor costs at ESPN due to headcount growth and labor cost inflation.
The increase in selling, general and administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher marketing and sales costs, which included an increase due to the change in transfer pricing arrangement for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and higher marketing costs at ESPN.
Equity in the Income of Investees Income from equity investees increased to $584 million in the current year from $438 million in the prior year driven by an increase at AETN/Lifetime primarily due to the absence of a $58 million charge for our share of programming write-offs at AETN/Lifetime in the prior year and higher advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by higher marketing costs.
30 Table of Contents Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 20%, or $1.0 billion, to $6.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases at ESPN, the ABC Television Network, the worldwide Disney Channels, our AETN/Lifetime joint venture and the owned television stations.

The charges in fiscal 2010 were for severance and related costs and the closure of five ESPN Zone locations. The charges in fiscal 2009 were primarily due to $142 million of radio FCC license impairments, a $65 million impairment charge related to our investment in UTV and severance and related costs. These charges were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Parks and Resorts Operating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: Year Ended %Change Better / (Worse) (in millions) October1, 2011 October2, 2010 Revenues Domestic $ 9,302 $ 8,404 11% International 2,495 2,357 6% Total revenues 11,797 10,761 10% Operating expenses (7,383) (6,787) (9)% Selling, general, administrative and other (1,696) (1,517) (12)% Depreciation and amortization (1,165) (1,139) (2)% Operating Income $ 1,553 $ 1,318 18% Revenues Parks and Resorts revenues increased 10%, or $1 billion, to $11.8 billion due to an increase of $898 million at our domestic operations and an increase of $138 million at our international operations.
Revenue growth of 11% at our domestic operations reflected a 6% increase driven by higher average guest spending and a 3% increase due to volume driven by higher passenger cruise ship days due to the launch of our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream , in January 2011, and higher attendance. Higher guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices, daily hotel room rates, and food, beverage, and merchandise spending.
Revenue growth of 6% at our international operations reflected a 4% increase due to higher average guest spending, a 3% increase driven by volume due to higher attendance and hotel occupancy, and a 3% favorable impact of foreign currency translation primarily as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. These increases were partially offset by a 2% decrease due to the prior-year sale of a real estate property at Disneyland Paris and a 1% decrease due to the temporary closure of the Tokyo Disney Resort following the March 2011 earthquake in Japan.

Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include operating labor which increased by $262 million from $3,278 million to $3,540 million driven by labor cost inflation and higher pension and postretirement medical expenses. Operating expenses also include cost of sales which increased $88 million from $1,110 million to $1,198 million driven by volume, partially offset by the absence of the costs related to a prior-year real estate sale at Disneyland Paris. Operating expenses also increased due to launch and operating costs in connection with the Disney Dream , enhancement and expansion costs, including new guest offerings at Disney California Adventure and investments in our systems infrastructure, and costs for Aulani, our new hotel and vacation club resort in Hawaii. In addition there was an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro.
The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher marketing costs at our domestic parks and resorts, costs associated with the additional cruise ship and our new resort in Hawaii, and labor cost inflation.
Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 18%, or $235 million, to $1.6 billion due to increases at our domestic parks and resorts and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by costs for our new resort in Hawaii and a decrease at Tokyo Disney Resort.

Lower home entertainment revenue reflected an 11% decrease due to the change in the transfer pricing arrangement for Studio distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product, partially offset by a 1% increase due to higher net effective pricing internationally which benefitted from a higher Blu-ray sales mix. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns.
The increase in television distribution and other revenues reflected 5% growth due to the inclusion of Marvel which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of the prior year and a 4% increase due to higher revenue share from the Consumer Products segment resulting from the strength of Cars merchandise.
Cost and Expenses Operating expenses included a decrease of $262 million in film cost amortization, from $2,142 million to $1,880 million, driven by lower film cost write-downs. Operating expenses also include cost of sales and distribution expenses which decreased $71 million from $1,327 million to $1,256 million primarily due to the change in the transfer pricing arrangement between Studio Entertainment and Media Networks for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product.
Selling, general, administrative and other costs were essentially flat as higher marketing for Marvel titles and an increase in technology infrastructure spending were largely offset by lower theatrical pre-release marketing expense and the change in the transfer pricing arrangement with Media Networks for home entertainment product.
The increase in depreciation and amortization was driven by higher amortization on intangible assets related to certain Marvel film properties.
Segment Operating Income Segment operating income decreased 11%, or $75 million, to $618 million primarily due to lower results at our theatrical and home entertainment businesses and higher technology infrastructure spending, partially offset by lower film cost write-downs and a higher revenue share with the Consumer Products segment.
Restructuring and impairment charges The Company recorded charges of $33 million, $151 million and $47 million related to Studio Entertainment for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2011 and 2009 were primarily for severance and related costs.

Higher revenues from Marvel properties reflected the impact of acquisition accounting which reduced revenue recognition in the prior year as well as a full year of operations as Marvel was acquired at the end of the first quarter of the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a 5% decrease due to a higher revenue share to the Studio Entertainment segment resulting from the strength of Cars merchandise.
The increase in retail and other revenues was primarily due to a 9% increase from higher revenues at the Disney Store in North America and Europe driven by higher comparable store sales and a 6% increase resulting from the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan, which was acquired at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010.
Licensing and publishing and retail and other revenues also increased by 2% and 3%, respectively, due to the benefit from a favorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the Euro.
Costs and Expenses Operating expenses included an increase of $57 million in cost of goods sold, from $521 million to $578 million, driven by the acquisitions of The Disney Store Japan and Marvel. Operating expenses also included a 2% increase due to higher occupancy costs driven by an increase at our retail business reflecting the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan and a 1% increase due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the Euro.
The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was driven by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the Euro; the inclusion of a full year of operations for Marvel and various promotional initiatives across multiple businesses.
The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets for Marvel and an increase at the Disney Stores due to an increase in new stores and remodels.
Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 21%, or $139 million, to $816 million primarily due to increases in our Merchandise Licensing and North American retail businesses.
Restructuring and impairment charges The Company recorded charges totaling $16 million and $19 million related to Consumer Products for fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were for severance and related costs which were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Additionally, the inclusion of Playdom for a full year compared to one month in the prior year resulted in a 10% increase in game sales and subscription revenues.
Higher advertising and other revenue was driven by our mobile phone service in Japan.
Costs and Expenses Operating expense included a $60 million increase in product development expense from $335 million to $395 million primarily due to the inclusion of Playdom for a full year. Operating expenses also included a 12% increase due to higher cost of sales driven by fees paid to the developer of Lego Pirates of the Caribbean and higher console game unit sales.
The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to the inclusion of Playdom for a full year, including the impact of acquisition accounting.
Segment Operating Loss Segment operating loss was $308 million compared to $234 million in the prior year as an improvement at our console game business was more than offset by the inclusion of Playdom for a full year, including the impact of acquisition accounting.
Restructuring and impairment charges The Company recorded charges totaling $22 million, $2 million and $42 million related to Interactive Media for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were for severance and related costs. The charges in fiscal 2009 were for goodwill impairment and severance and related costs. These charges were reported in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
NON-SEGMENT ITEMS  2011 vs. 2010 Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased 9%, from $420 million to $459 million, primarily due to the timing of expenses and compensation related costs.
Net Interest Expense Net interest expense is detailed below: (in millions) 2011 2010 %Change Better/(Worse) Interest expense $(435) $(456) 5 % Interest and investment income 92 47 96 % Net interest expense $(343) $(409) 16 % The decrease in interest expense for the year reflected lower effective interest rates.
The increase in interest and investment income for the year was driven by gains on sales of investments.
Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rate decreased 0.3 percentage points from 34.9% in 2010 to 34.6% in 2011 as the absence of a charge related to the health care reform legislation and a benefit from an increase in the domestic production deduction rate were largely offset by a decrease in favorable resolutions of prior-year tax matters. During fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a $72 million charge related to the enactment of health care reform legislation in March 2010. Under this legislation the Companys deductions for retiree prescription drug benefits will be reduced by the amount of Medicare Part D drug subsidies received beginning in fiscal year 2014. Under applicable accounting rules, the Company was required to reduce its existing deferred tax asset, which was established for the future deductibility of retiree prescription drug benefit costs, to reflect the lost deductions. The reduction was recorded as a charge to earnings in the period the legislation was enacted.
35 Table of Contents Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $101 million to $451 million due to improved operating results at ESPN and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes.
PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS Pension and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments, with approximately one-half of these costs being borne by the Parks and Resorts segment. The Company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of $576 million, $482 million, and $214 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2011 was driven by a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available and was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed from a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves.
We expect pension and postretirement medical costs to increase by approximately $50 million to $626 million in fiscal 2012 driven by a lower assumed discount rate, partially offset by a favorable impact due to plan amendments. The decrease in the discount rate also resulted in an increase in the underfunded status of our plans and an increase in unrecognized pension and postretirement medical expense to $4.2 billion ($2.6 billion after tax) as of October1, 2011. If our investment performance does not improve relative to our long-term assumption and/or discount rates do not increase, we expect that pension and postretirement medical costs will continue at levels comparable to fiscal 2012 for the next few years as a result of amortizing these unrecognized expenses. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the impacts of our pension and postretirement medical plans on our financial statements and amendments we made to our plans in fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2011, the Company contributed $935 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans including discretionary contributions above the minimum requirements for pension plans. The Company currently expects pension and postretirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2012 to total approximately $325 million to $375 million. Final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2012 will be determined based on our January1, 2012 funding actuarial valuation which will be available in late fiscal 2012. See Item 1A  Risk Factors for the impact of factors affecting pension and postretirement medical costs.
BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  2010 vs. 2009 Media Networks Operating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows: Year Ended %Change Better / (Worse) (in millions) October2, 2010 October3, 2009 Revenues Affiliate Fees $ 8,082 $ 7,407 9 % Advertising 7,028 6,566 7 % Other 2,052 2,236 (8)% Total revenues 17,162 16,209 6 % Operating expenses (9,888) (9,464) (4) % Selling, general, administrative and other (2,358) (2,341) (1) % Depreciation and amortization (222) (206) (8) % Equity in the income of investees 438 567 (23)% Operating Income $ 5,132 $ 4,765 8 % Revenues The 9% increase in Affiliate Fees, which are generally derived from fees charged on a per-subscriber basis, was primarily due to contractual rate increases and subscriber growth at Cable Networks which resulted in revenue increases of 5% and 4%, respectively, partially offset by the impact of one fewer week of operations.
36 Table of Contents Higher advertising revenues were due to increases of $362 million at Cable Networks from $2,689 million to $3,051 million and of $100 million at Broadcasting from $3,877 million to $3,977 million. The increase at Cable Networks reflected an increase of 9% due to higher sold inventory. The increase at Broadcasting reflected increases of 4% due to higher network advertising rates and sold inventory and 3% due to higher local television advertising, partially offset by a 4% decrease due to lower network ratings and one fewer week of operations.
Other revenues decreased $94 million at Cable Networks and $90 million at Broadcasting. The decrease at Cable Networks was driven by the closure of five ESPN Zone restaurants in June 2010. The decrease at Broadcasting reflected lower domestic television syndication revenues due to the sales of According to Jim and Greys Anatomy in fiscal 2009.
Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include an increase in programming and production costs of $377 million from $8,076 million to $8,453 million. At Cable Networks an increase in programming and production costs of $446 million was driven by higher sports rights costs due to new international sports programming rights and increased contractual costs for college and professional sports programming. At Broadcasting a decrease in programming and production costs of $69 million was driven by costs savings at news and daytime and a lower cost mix of programming in primetime.
The increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher pension and postretirement medical and compensation related costs, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $60 million due to the absence of a bad debt charge in connection with a bankruptcy of a syndication customer in fiscal 2009 and a decrease due to the closure of five ESPN Zone restaurants in June 2010.
Equity in the Income of Investees Income from equity investees decreased to $438 million in fiscal 2010 from $567 million in fiscal 2009 driven by a $58 million charge for our share of programming write-offs at AETN/Lifetime in fiscal 2010.
Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 8%, or $367 million, to $5.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases at ESPN, the owned television stations and the international Disney Channels, partially offset by lower equity income.

The decline in revenue at our domestic operations reflected the impact of one fewer week of operations in fiscal 2010 and a 1% volume decrease reflecting lower vacation club ownership sales, lower hotel occupancy and lower passenger cruise ship days. These decreases were partially offset by higher guest spending primarily due to higher average ticket prices and higher average daily hotel room rates.
The 6% revenue increase at our international operations reflected increases of 3% due to higher guest spending and 3% due to the sale of a real estate property at Disneyland Paris as well as higher attendance and hotel occupancy. Higher guest spending was driven by higher average ticket prices and average daily hotel room rates.

NON-SEGMENT ITEMS  2010 vs. 2009 Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased 6%, from $398 million to $420 million, primarily due to higher information technology and compensation costs.
Net Interest Expense Net interest expense is detailed below: (in millions) 2010 2009 %Change Better/(Worse) Interest expense $ (456) $ (588) 22% Interest and investment income 47 122 (61)% Net interest expense $ (409) $ (466) 12% The decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to lower effective interest rates and lower average debt balances, partially offset by expense related to the early redemption of a film financing borrowing.
The decrease in interest and investment income for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a gain on the sale of an investment in the prior year, lower effective interest rates and lower average cash balances.
Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate decreased 1.3 percentage points from 36.2% in 2009 to 34.9% in 2010. The lower effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to favorable adjustments related to prior-year income tax matters, partially offset by a $72 million charge related to the health care reform legislation enacted in March 2010.
Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $48 million to $350 million driven by improved operating results at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and ESPN.

41 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cash provided by operations $ 6,994 $ 6,578 $ 5,319 Cash used by investing activities (3,286) (4,523) (1,755) Cash used by financing activities (3,233) (2,663) (3,111) Impact of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (12) (87) (37) Increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 463 $ (695) $ 416 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2011 increased 6% or $416 million to $7.0 billion as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher operating cash receipts driven by higher revenues at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Consumer Products and Interactive Media businesses, partially offset by lower revenues at our Studio Entertainment business. These increases were partially offset by higher cash payments at Corporate and at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Interactive Media, and Consumer Products businesses, partially offset by a decrease in cash payments at our Studio Entertainment business. The increase in cash payments at Corporate was driven by higher contributions to our pension plans, while the increase at Media Networks was primarily due to higher investment in television programming and production. The increase in cash payments at Parks and Resorts was driven by labor cost inflation, higher promotional and operating costs from the January launch of our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream , and higher marketing and sales expenses and expansion costs for Disney California Adventure at Disneyland Resort. The increase in cash payments at Interactive Media reflects the inclusion of Playdom, while the increase in cash payments at Consumer Products was primarily due to the acquisitions of The Disney Store Japan and Marvel. The decrease in cash payments at Studio Entertainment was driven by lower film production spending.
Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 increased 24% or $1.3 billion to $6.6 billion as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was driven by higher operating cash receipts at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment businesses and lower cash payments at our Studio Entertainment segment driven by a decrease in distribution and marketing expense, partially offset by higher income tax payments. The increase in cash receipts at our Media Networks and Studio Entertainment segments was driven by higher revenues, while the increase in cash receipts at Parks and Resorts was driven by the timing of advance travel deposits.

Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the Companys broadcast, cable networks, and television stations. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability.

The Companys investments in parks, resorts and other property for the last three years are as follows: (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Media Networks Cable Networks $ 179 $ 132 $ 151 Broadcasting 128 92 143 Parks and Resorts Domestic 2,294 1,295 1,039 International 429 238 143 Studio Entertainment 118 102 135 Consumer Products 115 97 46 Interactive Media 21 17 21 Corporate 275 137 75 $ 3,559 $ 2,110 $ 1,753 Capital expenditures for the Parks and Resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, cruise ships, new rides and attractions, recurring capital and capital improvements. The increase in capital expenditures at domestic and international parks and resorts in fiscal 2011 reflected the final payment on our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream , theme park and resort expansions and new guest offerings at Walt Disney World Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and the development of Shanghai Disney Resort. The increase in capital expenditures at domestic and international parks and resorts in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 reflected higher construction progress payments on the two new cruise ships, the expansions at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disney California Adventure and the construction of Aulani, a Disney Resort& Spa in Hawaii. The increase in capital expenditures at Consumer Products from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2011 was driven by costs at the Disney Stores for new stores and remodels.
Capital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities, and television station facilities.
43 Table of Contents Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure. The increases in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were driven by investments in equipment and corporate facilities.
Other Investing Activities During fiscal 2011, proceeds from dispositions of $564 million primarily due to the sale of Miramax, were partially offset by acquisitions totaling $184 million which included additional payments related to the acquisition of Playdom, Inc. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
During fiscal 2010, acquisitions totaled $2.5 billion and included the acquisitions of Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and Playdom, Inc., and were partially offset by net proceeds totaling $170 million from the sale of our investments in two television services in Europe and the sale of the rights and assets related to the Power Rangers property.

Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 increased by $570 million to $3.2 billion compared to fiscal 2010 and consisted of repurchases of common stock and the payment of dividends partially offset by borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The increase from fiscal 2010 was due to higher repurchases of common stock, partially offset by higher net borrowings. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2010 decreased by $448 million to $2.7 billion compared to fiscal 2009 and consisted of repurchases of common stock, repayments of borrowings, and the payment of dividends partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The decrease from fiscal 2009 was due to lower repayments of borrowings and increased proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by higher share repurchases.
During the year ended October1, 2011, the Companys borrowing activity was as follows: (in millions) October2, 2010 Additions Payments Other Activity October1, 2011 Commercial paper borrowings $ 1,190 $ 393 $  $  $ 1,583 U.S. medium-term notes 6,815 2,350 (750) (15) 8,400 European medium-term notes 273  (168) (14) 91 Other foreign currency denominated debt (1) 965   55 1,020 Other (2) 651  (37) (42) 572 Disneyland Paris borrowings 2,113  (164) 32 1,981 Hong Kong Disneyland Resort borrowings ( 3 ) 473   (143) 330 Total $ 12,480 $ 2,743 $ (1,119) $ (127) $ 13,977 (1) The other activity is primarily the impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.
( 2 ) The other activity is primarily market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.
( 3 ) The other activity is primarily due to the conversion of a portion of the HKSARs loan to equity pursuant to the capital realignment and expansion plan (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
The Companys bank facilities are as follows: (in millions) Committed Capacity Capacity Used Unused Capacity Bank facilities expiring February 2013 $ 2,250 $  $ 2,250 Bank facilities expiring February 2015 2,250 47 2,203 Total $ 4,500 $ 47 $ 4,453 In February 2011, the Company entered into a new four-year $2.25 billion bank facility with a syndicate of lenders. This facility, in combination with the facility that matures in 2013, is used to support commercial paper borrowings. The new bank facility allows the Company to issue up to $800 million of letters of credit, which if utilized, reduces available borrowings under this facility. As of October1, 2011, $315 million of letters of credit had been issued of which $47 million was issued under this facility. These bank facilities allow for borrowings at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, which depends on the Companys public debt rating and can range from 0.33% to 4.50%.
44 Table of Contents The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.
The Company paid a $0.40 per share dividend ($756 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 related to fiscal 2010. The Company paid a $0.35 per share dividend ($653 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 related to fiscal 2009; and paid a $0.35 per share dividend ($648 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 related to fiscal 2008. As of the filing date of this report, the Board of Directors had not yet declared a dividend related to fiscal 2011.
During fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased 135million shares of Disney common stock for $5.0 billion. During fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased 80million shares of Disney common stock for $2.7 billion. During fiscal 2009, the Company repurchased 5million shares of Disney common stock for $138 million. On March 22, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors increased the amount of shares that can be repurchased to 400 million shares as of that date. As of October1, 2011, the Company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase 305million additional shares.
We believe that the Companys financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Companys operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. See Item 1A  Risk Factors. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Companys borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Companys performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of October1, 2011, Moodys Investors Services long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, with stable outlook; Standard& Poors long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1, respectively, with stable outlook; and Fitchs long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F-1, respectively, with stable outlook. The Companys bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on October1, 2011, by a significant margin. The Companys bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, such as Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, from any representations, covenants or events of default.
Disneyland Paris has in its debt agreements certain annual financial performance objectives and limits on investing and financing activities. In fiscal 2011, Disneyland Paris did not meet its annual performance objectives and must defer 25million of royalties and management fees payable to the Company and 20million of interest payable to a French state bank. Additionally, as a result of the fact that the performance objectives were not met, certain of Disneyland Pariss investment activities are further limited by the debt agreements.
Disneyland Paris is also subject to certain financial covenants and believes that it is in compliance with such covenants with the assistance of the Companys agreement, as permitted under the debt agreements, to defer an additional 9million of royalties payable to the Company into subordinated long-term borrowings.
The deferrals discussed above and compliance with these financial covenants are subject to final third-party review as provided in Disneyland Pariss debt agreements.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.
45 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at October1, 2011 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Film and Television Revenues and Costs We expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current periods revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if estimates of Ultimate Revenues increase, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
46 Table of Contents With respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is domestic theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or international theatrical markets) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance. Domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a films release and determination of domestic theatrical performance, the Companys estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products.
With respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is the programs rating and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Companys ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication, international and home entertainment markets. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates.
We expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies, series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the programs ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each seasons relative value, we expense the related contractual payment during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.
Costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Companys dayparts are: daytime, late night, primetime, news, children, and sports (includes network and cable). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel. Individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.
Revenue Recognition The Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies.
We reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. These estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. If we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount. Conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated.
We recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. For non-expiring, multi-day tickets, revenues are recognized over a four-year time period based on estimated usage, which is derived from historical usage patterns. If actual usage is different than our estimated usage, revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered. In addition, a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition.
Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions The Companys pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.
47 Table of Contents The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We decreased our discount rate to 4.75% at the end of fiscal 2011 from 5.25% at the end of fiscal 2010 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our October1, 2011 measurement date. This decrease in the discount rate will affect net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense (benefit expense) in fiscal 2012. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Companys discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2012 by $223 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October1, 2011 by $1.9 billion, respectively. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by $193 million and $1.6 billion, respectively.
To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. Our long-term expected return on plan assets was 7.75% for both of the 2011 and 2010 actuarial valuations. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2012 annual benefit expense by approximately $70 million.
See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension and postretirement medical plans.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill.
To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. These amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.
In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Companys long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
The Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.
The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group against the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by the group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the groups long-lived assets and the carrying value of the groups long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the assets fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
48 Table of Contents The Company has cost and equity investments. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors, as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required.
During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the Company tested its goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and long-lived assets for impairment, and the impairment charges recorded were immaterial. During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $279 million, which included $142 million for FCC radio licenses and $65 million for our investment in UTV. The FCC radio license impairment charges reflected overall market declines in certain radio markets in which we operate. These impairment charges, which were estimated using a discounted cash flow model, were recorded in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, cost and expenses may decrease in future periods.
Contingencies and Litigation We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.
Income Tax Audits As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments.Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Companys decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Companys success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.
ACCOUNTING CHANGES Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables effective for the Companys 2011 fiscal year. The guidance revises the criteria for separating, measuring, and allocating arrangement consideration to each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement. The guidance requires companies to allocate revenue using the relative selling price of each deliverable, which must be estimated if the company does not have a history of selling the deliverable on a stand-alone basis or third-party evidence of selling price. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets In June2009, the FASB issued guidance on transfers and servicing of financial assets to eliminate the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, change the requirements for off balance sheet accounting for financial assets including limiting the circumstances where off balance sheet treatment for a portion of a financial asset is allowable, and require additional disclosures. The guidance is effective for the Companys 2011 fiscal year. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.
Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance to revise the approach to determine when a variable interest entity (VIE) should be consolidated. The new consolidation model for VIEs considers whether an entity has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and shares in the significant risks and rewards of the VIE. The guidance on VIEs requires companies to continually reassess VIEs to determine if consolidation is appropriate and provide additional disclosures. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.
49 Table of Contents Employee Compensation  Retirement Benefits In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance that requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and changes in that funded status to be recognized in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The guidance on retirement benefits also requires measurement of the funded status of a plan as of the end of the fiscal year. The Company adopted the recognition provision in fiscal year 2007 which resulted in a $261 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the measurement date provision by remeasuring plan assets and benefit obligations at the beginning of fiscal 2009. Adoption of the measurement date provisions resulted in a reduction of $35 million to retained earnings and a $100 million benefit to accumulated other comprehensive income.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward-looking, including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These statements are made on the basis of managements views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item1A  Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K.
ITEM7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.
Policies and Procedures In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Companys exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, commodities, and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments.
Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Companys portfolio of borrowings. By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.
Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. The Company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. The Company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. The principal foreign currencies hedged are the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollar. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures.
Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.
It is the Companys policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.
50 Table of Contents Value at Risk (VAR) The Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Companys computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at fiscal year end. The model includes all of the Companys debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.
The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.
VAR on a combined basis increased to $58 million at October1, 2011 from $33 million at October2, 2010. The increase in VAR primarily reflected an increase in the amount of fixed rate debt during the year and higher volatility of interest rates.
The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): Fiscal Year 2011 InterestRate Sensitive Financial Instruments Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments EquitySensitive Financial Instruments Combined Portfolio Year end VAR $34 $27 $7 $58 Average VAR $24 $27 $4 $44 Highest VAR $34 $34 $8 $58 Lowest VAR $15 $20 $1 $32 Beginning of year VAR (year end fiscal2010) $19 $22 $1 $33 The VAR for Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort is immaterial as of October1, 2011 and accordingly, has been excluded from the above table.

58 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October1, 2011.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October1, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
59 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Walt Disney Company In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries (the Company) at October1, 2011 and October2, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October1, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October1, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2009.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

65 Table of Contents SEGMENT INFORMATION The operating segments reported below are the segments of the Company for which separate financial information is available and for which segment results are evaluated regularly by the Chief Executive Officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
Segment operating results reflect earnings before corporate and unallocated shared expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, other income (expense), net interest expense, income taxes, and noncontrolling interests. Segment operating income includes equity in the income of investees. Equity investees consist primarily of AETN/Lifetime, which is a cable business included in the Media Networks segment. Corporate and unallocated shared expenses principally consist of corporate functions, executive management, and certain unallocated administrative support functions.
Equity in the income of investees by segment is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Media Networks (1) $ 584 $ 438 $ 567 Studio Entertainment   (4) Consumer Products   2 Interactive Media   2 Corporate 1 2 10 $ 585 $ 440 $ 577 (1) Substantially all of these amounts relate to investments at Cable Networks.
Beginning fiscal 2011, the Company made changes to certain transfer pricing arrangements between its business units. The most significant change was to the allocation of home video revenue and distribution costs between the Media Networks and Studio Entertainment segments for home video titles produced by the Media Networks segment and distributed by the Studio Entertainment segment. These changes will generally result in higher revenues, expenses and operating income at our Media Networks segment with offsetting declines at our Studio Entertainment segment.
The following segment results include allocations of certain costs, including information technology, pension, legal, and other shared services costs, which are allocated based on metrics designed to correlate with consumption. These allocations are agreed-upon amounts between the businesses and may differ from amounts that would be negotiated in arms length transactions. In addition, all significant intersegment transactions have been eliminated except that Studio Entertainment revenues and operating income include an allocation of Consumer Products and Interactive Media revenues, which is meant to reflect royalties on sales of merchandise based on certain Studio film properties.

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The Walt Disney Company and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In December 1999, DVD Financing, Inc. (DFI), a subsidiary of Disney Vacation Development, Inc. and an indirect subsidiary of the Company, completed a receivables sale transaction that established a facility that permitted DFI to sell receivables arising from the sale of vacation club memberships on a periodic basis. In connection with this facility, DFI prepares separate financial statements, although its separate assets and liabilities are also consolidated in these financial statements. DFIs ability to sell new receivables under this facility ended on December4, 2008. (See Note 16 for further discussion of this facility) The Company enters into relationships or investments with other entities, and in certain instances, the entity in which the Company has a relationship or investment may qualify as a variable interest entity (VIE). A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort are VIEs, and given the nature of the Companys relationships with these entities, which include management agreements, the Company has consolidated Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort in its financial statements.
69 Table of Contents Reporting Period The Companys fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September30 and consists of fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three week year. When a fifty-three week year occurs, the Company reports the additional week in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2009 was a fifty-three week year beginning on September28, 2008 and ending on October3, 2009.
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 financial statements and notes to conform to the fiscal 2011 presentation.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition Broadcast advertising revenues are recognized when commercials are aired. Revenues from television subscription services related to the Companys primary cable programming services are recognized as services are provided. Certain of the Companys contracts with cable and satellite operators include annual live programming commitments. In these cases, recognition of revenues subject to the commitments is deferred until the annual commitments are satisfied, which generally results in higher revenue recognition in the second half of the year.
Revenues from advance theme park ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used. For non-expiring, multi-day tickets, revenues are recognized over a four-year time period based on estimated usage, which is derived from historical usage patterns.
Revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized when motion pictures are exhibited. Revenues from DVD and video game sales, net of anticipated returns and customer incentives, are recognized on the date that video units are made available for sale by retailers. Revenues from the licensing of feature films and television programming are recorded when the content is available for telecast by the licensee and when certain other conditions are met.
Merchandise licensing advances and guarantee royalty payments are recognized based on the contractual royalty rate when the licensed product is sold by the licensee. Non-refundable advances and minimum guarantee royalty payments in excess of royalties earned are generally recognized as revenue at the end of the contract term.
Revenues from our internet and mobile operations are recognized as services are rendered. Advertising revenues at our internet operations are recognized when advertisements are viewed online.
Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a net basis.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on our analysis of trends in overall receivables aging, specific identification of certain receivables that are at risk of not being paid, past collection experience and current economic trends. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, the Companys estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of its receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods.
Advertising Expense Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $2.8 billion, $2.6 billion, and $2.7 billion, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less.
70 Table of Contents Investments Debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity and marketable equity securities are classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Trading and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), respectively. All other equity securities are accounted for using either the cost method or the equity method.
The Company regularly reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary. If the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value.
Translation Policy The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority of our international operations. The local currency is the functional currency for Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, Shanghai Disney Resort and international locations of The Disney Stores.
For U.S. dollar functional currency locations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in income.
For local currency functional locations, assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).
Inventories Inventory primarily includes vacation timeshare units, merchandise, materials, and supplies. Carrying amounts of vacation ownership units are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Carrying amounts of merchandise, materials, and supplies inventories are generally determined on a moving average cost basis and are recorded at the lower of cost or market.
Film and Television Costs Film and television costs include capitalizable production costs, production overhead, interest, development costs, and acquired production costs and are stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value. Acquired programming costs for the Companys television and cable networks are stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or net realizable value. Acquired television broadcast program licenses and rights are recorded when the license period begins and the program is available for use. Marketing, distribution, and general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.
Film and television production, participation and residual costs are expensed over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current periods revenues to estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. For acquired film libraries, remaining revenues include amounts to be earned for up to twenty years from the date of acquisition. Costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The amount by which the unamortized costs of film and television productions exceed their estimated fair values is written off. Film development costs for projects that have been abandoned or have not been set for production within three years are generally written off.
The costs of television broadcast rights for acquired movies, series and other programs are expensed based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements are amortized during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated values of each year are based on our projections of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each seasons relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. Individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program.
71 Table of Contents The net realizable values of network television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Companys dayparts are: daytime, late night, primetime, news, children, and sports (includes network and cable). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel.
Internal-Use Software Costs The Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies, as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training. Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. As of October1, 2011 and October2, 2010, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated depreciation, totaled $486 million and $476 million, respectively. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, ranging from 3-10 years.
Software Product Development Costs Software product development costs incurred prior to reaching technological feasibility are expensed. We have determined that technological feasibility of our video game software is generally not established until substantially all product development is complete.
Parks, Resorts and Other Property Parks, resorts, and other property are carried at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows: Attractions 25  40 years Buildings and improvements 20  40 years Leasehold improvements Life of lease or asset life if less Land improvements 20  40 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3  25 years Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill.
To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. These amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results.
In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Companys long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
The Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.
72 Table of Contents The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group against the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the groups long-lived assets and the carrying value of the groups long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amount, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the assets fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.
During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the Company tested its goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, and the impairment charges recorded were not material. During fiscal year 2009, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $142 million related to FCC radio licenses and a goodwill impairment charge totaling $29 million. The FCC radio license impairment charges reflected overall market declines in certain radio markets in which we operate. The FCC radio license and goodwill impairment charges, which were determined based on a discounted cash flow model, were recorded in Restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Amortizable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods up to 40 years. The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred. The Company has determined that there are currently no legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our FCC licenses and trademarks.
The Company expects its aggregate annual amortization expense for existing amortizable intangible assets for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to be as follows: 2012 $176 2013 156 2014 119 2015 110 2016 106 Risk Management Contracts In the normal course of business, the Company employs a variety of financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and investments in equity and debt securities, including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements, and forward and option contracts.
The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions. There are two types of derivatives into which the Company enters: hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure. Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment. Hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction (e.g. forecasted revenue) or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received, related to a recognized liability or asset (e.g. floating rate debt).
The Company designates and assigns the financial instruments as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities. When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions being hedged are no longer expected to occur, the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated hedging instruments.
Option premiums and unrealized gains on forward contracts and the accrued differential for interest rate and cross-currency swaps to be received under the agreements are recorded on the balance sheet as other assets. Unrealized losses on forward contracts and the accrued differential for interest rate and cross-currency swaps to be paid under the agreements are included in liabilities. Realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the income statement consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged. The Company accrues the differential for interest rate and cross-currency swaps to be paid or received under the agreements as interest rates and exchange rates change as adjustments to interest expense over the lives of the swaps. Gains and losses on the termination of effective swap agreements, prior to their original maturity, are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying hedged transactions.
73 Table of Contents The Company enters into risk management contracts that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. These contracts are intended to offset certain economic exposures of the Company and are carried at market value with any changes in value recorded in earnings. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under the same category as the cash flows from the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions (see Notes 9 and 17).
Income Taxes The Company accounts for current and deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded with respect to temporary differences in the accounting treatment of items for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes. Where, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount that, in managements judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
A tax position must meet a minimum probability threshold before a financial statement benefit is recognized.The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Earnings Per Share The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Disney by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year, which is calculated using the treasury-stock method for equity-based awards (Awards). Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods for which they have an anti-dilutive effect. Stock options for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period are anti-dilutive and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation.
A reconciliation of the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding and the number of Awards excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation, as they were anti-dilutive, are as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding (basic) 1,878 1,915 1,856 Weighted average dilutive impact of Awards 31 33 19 Weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding (diluted) 1,909 1,948 1,875 Awards excluded from diluted earnings per share 8 37 145 3 New Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables effective for the Companys 2011 fiscal year. The guidance revises the criteria for separating, measuring, and allocating arrangement consideration to each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement. The guidance requires companies to allocate revenue using the relative selling price of each deliverable, which must be estimated if the company does not have a history of selling the deliverable on a stand-alone basis or third-party evidence of selling price. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets In June2009, the FASB issued guidance on transfers and servicing of financial assets to eliminate the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, change the requirements for off balance sheet accounting for financial assets including limiting the circumstances where off balance sheet treatment for a portion of a financial asset is allowable, and require additional disclosures. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.
74 Table of Contents Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance to revise the approach to determine when a variable interest entity (VIE) should be consolidated. The new consolidation model for VIEs considers whether an entity has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact a VIEs economic performance and shares in the significant risks and rewards of the VIE. The guidance on VIEs requires companies to continually reassess VIEs to determine if consolidation is appropriate and provide additional disclosures. The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2011, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.
Employee Compensation  Retirement Benefits In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance that requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and changes in that funded status to be recognized in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The guidance on retirement benefits also requires measurement of the funded status of a plan as of the end of the fiscal year. The Company adopted the recognition provision in fiscal year 2007 which resulted in a $261 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the measurement date provision by remeasuring plan assets and benefit obligations at the beginning of fiscal 2009. Adoption of the measurement date provisions resulted in a reduction of $35 million to retained earnings and a $100 million benefit to accumulated other comprehensive income.
Key assumptions used for the measurement of pension and postretirement medical plans at the beginning of fiscal 2009 were 7.80% for the discount rate, 7.50% for the rate of return on plan assets, and 5.00% for salary increases. Based on this measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations, pension and postretirement medical costs for fiscal 2009 were $214 million.
4 Acquisitions UTH Russia Limited On November 18, 2011, the Company acquired a 49% ownership interest in the Seven TV network from UTH Russia Limited (UTH) for $300 million. The Seven TV network will be converted to an ad-supported, free-to-air Disney Channel in Russia.
UTV On May9, 2008, the Company acquired a 24% interest (bringing its undiluted interest to 37%) in UTV Software Communications Limited (UTV), a media company headquartered and publicly traded in India, for approximately $197 million.In accordance with Indian securities regulations, the Company was required to make an open tender offer to purchase up to an additional 23% of UTVs publicly traded voting shares for a price equivalent to the May9th, 2008 Indian rupee purchase price. In November 2008, the Company completed the open offer and acquired an incremental 23% of UTVs voting shares for approximately $138 million bringing its undiluted interest to 60%. UTVs founder has a four-year option which expires in November 2012 to buy all or a portion of the shares acquired by the Company during the open-offer period at a price no less than the Companys open-offer price. The Company does not have the right to vote the shares subject to the option until the expiration of the option and accordingly the Companys ownership interest in voting shares was 48%. In January 2010, UTV issued additional shares in exchange for the outstanding noncontrolling interest of one of its subsidiaries diluting the Companys direct interest in UTV to 50% (39% voting interest).
In fiscal 2009, the Company wrote down its investment in UTV to fair value and recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $65 million. The fair value of the Companys investment in UTV was estimated based on the Companys internal valuation of the UTV business using an income approach (discounted cash flow model). The Company believes the principal market for its long-term strategic investment in UTV would be a privately negotiated transaction with another strategic investor and that the participants in this market would value this investment using the income approach. Accordingly, the income approach provided the most appropriate indicator of fair value of the Companys investment in UTV rather than the price of individual shares traded on Indian stock exchanges.
On July25, 2011, the UTV board of directors approved a proposal submitted by the Company to acquire the publicly held shares of UTV through a delisting offer process. Subsequently, the UTV shareholders approved the delisting of UTVs equity shares from the Indian stock exchanges. The delisting process is governed by Indian law and will, if completed, involve an offer by the Company to acquire shares publicly traded on the Indian stock exchanges at a price determined through the offer process. The final offer price is subject to the Companys acceptance and is currently limited in the Companys proposal to 1,000 Indian rupees per share. The Companys proposal also contemplates the purchase of all shares held by the founder of UTV, which constitute 20% of UTV, at the final offer price. The founders shares and the publicly held shares constitute all the UTV shares that the Company does not currently own. The transaction is subject to, among other things, Indian regulatory approval and the Companys acceptance of the price per share that results from the delisting offer process. If completed, the Companys interest in UTV would increase to at least 90% and result in a delisting of UTVs shares.
75 Table of Contents Playdom On August27, 2010, the Company acquired Playdom, Inc. (Playdom), a company that develops online social games. This acquisition is designed to strengthen the Companys digital gaming portfolio and provide access to a new customer base. Total consideration was approximately $563 million, subject to certain conditions and adjustments, of which approximately $108 million is subject to vesting conditions and recognized as post-close compensation expense. Additional consideration of up to $200 million may be paid if Playdom achieves predefined revenues and earnings targets for calendar year 2012. The Company has recognized the fair value (determined by a probability weighting of the potential payouts) of the additional consideration as a liability and subsequent changes in the estimate of fair value up to the ultimate amount to be paid, will be recognized in earnings.
The Disney Store Japan On March31, 2010, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Retail Networks Company Limited (The Disney Store Japan) in exchange for a $17 million note. At the time of the acquisition, The Disney Store Japan had a cash balance of $13 million. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recognized a $22 million non-cash gain from the deemed termination of the existing licensing arrangement. The gain is reported in Other income in the fiscal 2010 Consolidated Statement of Income.
Marvel On December31, 2009, the Company completed a cash and stock acquisition for the outstanding capital stock of Marvel Entertainment, Inc. (Marvel), a character-based entertainment company. This acquisition is consistent with the Companys strategic value creation through utilization of intellectual properties across Disneys multiple platforms and territories.
The acquisition purchase price totaled $4.2 billion. In accordance with the terms of the acquisition, Marvel shareholders received $30 per share in cash and 0.7452 Disney shares for each Marvel share they owned. In total, the Company paid $2.4 billion in cash and distributed shares valued at $1.9 billion (approximately 59million shares of Disney common stock at a price of $32.25).
The Company is required to allocate the purchase price to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill.

76 Table of Contents AETN / Lifetime On September15, 2009, the Company and the Hearst Corporation (Hearst) both contributed their 50% interests in Lifetime Entertainment Services LLC (Lifetime) to A&E Television Networks, LLC (AETN) in exchange for an increased interest in AETN. Prior to this transaction, the Company and Hearst each held 37.5% of AETN while NBC Universal (NBCU) held 25%. The Company accounted for the transaction as a sale of a portion of its interest in Lifetime which resulted in a $228 million non-cash pre-tax gain ($142 million after-tax) reflecting the difference between the Companys carrying amount of the Lifetime interest sold and the fair value of the incremental AETN interest received. Following the transaction the Companys ownership interest in the combined AETN/Lifetime is approximately 42%. Under the terms of the agreement, NBCU may elect or be required to exit the combined AETN/Lifetime over a period of up to 15 years, in which event the Company and Hearst would each own 50%. The Company accounts for its interest in the combined AETN/Lifetime as an equity method investment consistent with how it previously accounted for AETN and Lifetime.
Jetix Europe In December 2008, the Company acquired an additional 26% interest in Jetix Europe N.V., a publicly traded pan-European kids entertainment company, for approximately $354 million (bringing our total ownership interest to over 99%). The Company intends to acquire the remaining outstanding shares through market purchases and other means. The Company re-branded the Jetix channels to either Disney Channel or Disney XD.

The transactions contemplated by the MOA were fully implemented on February23, 2005 with the completion of a 253million equity rights offering in which the Company invested 100 million. The MOA included provisions for a ten-year 100 million line of credit from the Company for liquidity needs which has not been drawn and deferral of certain royalties and management fees payable by Disneyland Paris to the Company as follows:  Royalties and management fees for fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2009, totaling 125million, payable to the Company have been deferred and converted into subordinated long-term borrowings  Royalties and management fees for fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2014, of up to 25million per year, are subject to conditional deferral and conversion into subordinated long-term borrowings if operating results do not achieve specified levels. Royalties and management fees for fiscal 2008 and 2007, subject to conditional deferral, were not deferred and have been paid. Royalties and management fees for fiscal 2010 and 2009, subject to conditional deferral, have been deferred and converted into subordinated long-term borrowings. Based on operating results and subject to third-party confirmation, the Company will defer 25million of royalties and management fees subject to conditional deferral for fiscal 2011. The Company also deferred an additional 9 million of royalties so that Disneyland Paris could comply with its annual financial covenants. (See further discussion in Note 9) 81 Table of Contents Certain indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company have liability as current or former general partners of Disney S.C.A. In addition to their equity interest in Disney S.C.A., certain of these subsidiaries of the Company have been capitalized with interest-bearing demand notes with an aggregate face value of 200 million. In addition, interest of 41million has accrued on the notes from the date of issuance and has been added to the amount owed.
Hong Kong Disneyland Resort Capital Realignment In July 2009, the Company entered into a capital realignment and expansion plan for Hong Kong Disneyland Resort (HKDL) with the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), HKDLs majority shareholder. Key provisions of the plan include:  The Company converted its $354 million term and revolving credit facility loan to HKDL into equity during fiscal 2009. This was accompanied by conversion of an equal amount of the HKSAR loan to HKDL into equity  The Company would make approximately $0.4 billion of equity contributions to fund HKDL during the expansion, which is currently scheduled to be completed in phases by 2013. The actual amount of equity contributions by the Company may differ depending on the actual final cost of the expansion and operating results of HKDL during the relevant timeframe. The HKSAR will convert an additional amount of its loan to HKDL equal to these contributions into equity, subject to a maximum conversion amount that would leave approximately HK $1.0 billion ($128 million at October1, 2011 exchange rates) of the HKSAR loan to HKDL outstanding. At October1, 2011, the HKSAR loan to HKDL was $330 million. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company made equity contributions totaling $153 million, $66 million and $40 million, respectively.
As a result of the above arrangement, the Companys interest in HKDL has increased from 43% to 47% and is projected to increase to approximately 48% although the Companys ending ownership will depend on the aggregate amount of equity contributions made by the Company pursuant to the expansion plan.
Shanghai Disney Resort On April8, 2011, the Company and Shanghai Shendi (Group) Co., Ltd (Shendi) announced that the Chinese central government in Beijing had approved an agreement to build and operate a Disney resort in the Pudong district of Shanghai (Shanghai Disney Resort) that is operated through a joint venture between the Company and Shendi, in which Shendi owns a 57% interest and the Company owns 43%. Shanghai Disney Resort is scheduled to open in approximately five years. The project will be constructed in phases, and we expect the total investment to be approximately 24.5 billion yuan to build the theme park and an additional 4.5 billion yuan to build other aspects of the resort, including two hotels and a retail, dining and entertainment area. The Company will finance 43% of the initial investment in accordance with its equity ownership percentage. The Company consolidates Shanghai Disney Resort for financial statement reporting purposes due to the Companys involvement in the management of the resort.

The Company expects to amortize, based on current estimates, approximately $1.1billion in capitalized film and television production costs during fiscal 2012.
At October1, 2011, acquired film and television libraries have remaining unamortized costs of $252 million, which are generally amortized straight-line over a weighted-average remaining period of approximately 9 years.

Commercial Paper At October1, 2011, the Company had $1.6 billion of commercial paper debt outstanding. In February 2011, the Company entered into a new four-year $2.25 billion bank facility with a syndicate of lenders. This facility, in combination with an existing $2.25 billion bank facility that matures in 2013, is used to support commercial paper borrowings. These bank facilities allow for borrowings at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, which depends on the Companys public debt rating and can range from 0.33% to 4.50%. The Company also has the ability to issue up to $800 million of letters of credit under the new facility, which if utilized, reduces available borrowings under this facility. As of October1, 2011, $315 million of letters of credit had been issued of which $47 million was issued under this facility. The Companys bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on October1, 2011 by a significant margin.

In fiscal 2011, Disneyland Paris did not meet its annual performance objectives and must defer 25 million of royalties and management fees payable to the Company and 20 million of interest payable to the CDC. Additionally, as a result of the fact that the performance objectives were not met, certain of Disneyland Pariss investment activities are further limited by the debt agreements.
Disneyland Paris is also subject to certain financial covenants and believes that it is in compliance with such covenants with the assistance of the Companys agreement, as permitted under the debt agreements, to defer an additional 9 million of royalties payable to the Company into subordinated long-term borrowings.
The deferrals discussed above and compliance with these financial covenants are subject to final third-party review as provided in Disneyland Pariss debt agreements.
Hong Kong Disneyland Resort  Borrowings.
Hong Kong Disneyland Resort has an unsecured loan facility of HK$2.6 billion ($330 million at October1, 2011 exchange rate) from the HKSAR that is scheduled to mature on dates through September12, 2030.

As of October1, 2011, the rate on the loans was 3.25%.
Hong Kong Disneyland Resort Capital Realignment Plan In July 2009, the Company entered into a capital realignment and expansion plan (the Plan) for Hong Kong Disneyland Resort with the HKSAR. See Note 7 for further details of the Plan.
Total borrowings excluding market value adjustments, have the following scheduled maturities: BeforeInternational Theme Parks Consolidation InternationalTheme Parks Total 2012 $ 2,857 $ 188 $ 3,045 2013 1,871 166 2,037 2014 1,466 47 1,513 2015 67 132 199 2016 1,504 45 1,549 Thereafter 3,617 1,733 5,350 $ 11,382 $ 2,311 $ 13,693 85 Table of Contents The Company capitalizes interest on assets constructed for its parks, resorts, and other property and on theatrical productions. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, total interest capitalized was $91 million, $82 million, and $57 million, respectively. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, for 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $435 million, $456 million and $588 million, respectively.

The ultimate utilizationof the noncontrolling interest share of the net operating losses, which have an indefinite carryforward period, would not have an impact on the Companys net income attributable to Disney as any income tax benefit would be offset by a charge to noncontrolling interest in the income statement.
86 Table of Contents As of October1, 2011, the Company had undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $340 million for which deferred taxes have not been provided. The Company intends to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. If these amounts were distributed to the United States, in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes. Assuming the permanently reinvested foreign earnings were repatriated under laws and rates applicable at 2011 fiscal year end, the incremental U.S. tax applicable to the earnings would be approximately $30 million.
A reconciliation of the effective income tax rate to the federal rate is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Federal income tax rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% State taxes, net of federal benefit 2.1 2.6 2.6 Domestic production activity deduction (2.3) (1.7) (1.8) Other, including tax reserves and related interest (0.2) (1.0) 0.4 34.6% 34.9% 36.2% The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 made a number of changes to the income tax laws including the creation of a deduction for qualifying domestic production activities. The deduction equals three percent of qualifying net income for fiscal 2007, six percent for fiscal 2008 through 2010, and nine percent for fiscal 2011 and thereafter. Our tax provisions for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009 reflect benefits of $183 million, $111 million and $100 million, respectively, resulting from this deduction.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding the related accrual for interest, is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Balance at the beginning of the year $ 680 $ 686 $ 655 Increases for current year tax positions 75 58 63 Increases for prior year tax positions 41 141 17 Decreases in prior year tax positions (17) (192) (7) Settlements with taxing authorities (61) (13) (42) Balance at the end of the year $ 718 $ 680 $ 686 The year end 2011 and 2010 balances include $480 million and $473 million, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce our income tax expense and effective tax rate. These amounts are net of the offsetting benefits from other tax jurisdictions.
As of the end of fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company had $175 million and $163 million, respectively, in accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company accrued additional interest of $17 million, $28 million and $27 million, respectively, and recorded reductions in accrued interest of $13 million, $7 million and $12 million, respectively, as a result of audit settlements and other prior-year adjustments. The Companys policy is to report interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.
During the current year, the Company resolved various refund claims and other matters with tax authorities. The Company is also subject to U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax audits. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal examination for years prior to 2008. The Company is no longer subject to examination in any of its major state or foreign tax jurisdictions for years prior to 2003.
In the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could change due to the resolution of tax matters, including payments on the tax matters discussed above. These resolutions and payments could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by $93 million.
In fiscal 2011 and 2010, income tax benefits attributable to equity-based compensation transactions exceeded the amounts recorded based on grant date fair value. Accordingly, $109 million and $61 million were credited to shareholders equity, respectively in these years. In fiscal year 2009, income tax benefits attributable to equity-based compensation transactions were less than the amounts recorded at grant date and a shortfall of $26 million was charged to shareholders equity.
87 Table of Contents 11 Pension and Other Benefit Programs The Company maintains pension and postretirement medical benefit plans covering most of its employees not covered by union or industry-wide plans. Employees generally hired after January1, 1994 and employees generally hired after January1, 1987 for certain of our media businesses are not eligible for postretirement medical benefits. With respect to its defined benefit pension plans, the Companys policy is to fund, at a minimum, the amount necessary on an actuarial basis to provide for benefits in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Pension benefits are generally based on years of service and/or compensation.
In fiscal 2011, the Company substantially amended its salaried employees pension plans with respect to benefits earned for service after December 31, 2011. The Company reduced the vesting requirement from five years of vesting service to three years of vesting service, revised the early retirement reduction factors and excluded employees hired after December31, 2011 from plan participation. In addition, the percentage of average monthly compensation on which salary-related benefits are based was reduced while overtime, commissions and regular bonus amounts were added to the calculation of average monthly compensation received after December 31, 2011 to the extent those elements of compensation were not previously included. These amendments will reduce fiscal 2012 expense by approximately $75 million. The Company intends to provide benefits under new defined contribution plans for employees who begin service after December31, 2011.
The following chart summarizes the benefit obligations, assets, funded status and balance sheet impacts associated with the pension and postretirement medical benefit plans based upon the actuarial valuations prepared as of October1, 2011 and October2, 2010.

For pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets were $8.7 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, as of October1, 2011 and $7.3 billion and $4.9 billion as of October2, 2010, respectively.
The Companys total accumulated pension benefit obligations at October1, 2011 and October2, 2010 were $8.8 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, of which 97% for both years was vested.
89 Table of Contents The accumulated postretirement medical benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for postretirement medical plans with accumulated postretirement medical benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $1.6 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, at October1, 2011 and $1.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, at October2, 2010.
Plan Assets A significant portion of the assets of the Companys defined benefit plans are managed on a commingled basis in a third party master trust. The investment policy and allocation of the assets in the master trust were approved by the Companys Investment and Administrative Committee which has oversight responsibility for the Companys retirement plans. The investment policy ranges for the major asset classes are as follows: Asset Class Minimum Maximum Equity investments Small cap 0% 10% Mid/Large cap 15% 30% International 7% 27% Total equity investments 36% 60% Fixed income investments 20% 40% Alternative investments Diversified 0% 10% Distressed 0% 10% Private equity/Venture capital 0% 12% Real estate 0% 15% Total alternative investments 15% 30% Cash 0% 5% The primary investment objective for the assets within the master trust is to prudently and cost effectively manage assets to fulfill benefit obligations to plan participants. Financial risks are managed through diversification of plan assets, selection of investment managers and through the investment guidelines incorporated into investment management agreements. Assets are monitored to ensure that investment returns are commensurate with risks taken.
The long-term asset allocation policy for the master trust was established taking into consideration a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the average age of participants, the number of retirees, the duration of liabilities and the expected payout ratio. Liquidity needs of the master trust are generally managed using cash generated by investments or by liquidating securities.
Assets are generally managed by external investment managers and we have investment management agreements with respect to securities in the master trust. These agreements include account guidelines that establish permitted securities and risk controls commensurate with the accounts investment strategy. Some agreements permit the use of derivative securities (futures, options, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps) that enable investment managers to enhance returns and manage exposures within their accounts. Investment managers are prohibited from using derivatives to leverage returns.
90 Table of Contents The Companys defined benefit plans asset mix (including assets held outside of the master trust) at each fiscal year end is as follows: Asset Class 2011 2010 Equities: Small cap 3% 5% Mid cap 3% 4% Large cap 14% 17% International 21% 18% Fixed income: Corporate bonds 10% 10% Government and federal agency bonds, notes and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 21% 20% Mortgage and asset-backed securities 4% 3% Alternatives investments: Diversified 8% 9% Distressed 3% 3% Private equity 7% 6% Venture capital 1% 1% Real estate 4% 3% Cash 1% 1% Total 100% 100% (1) Large cap domestic equities include 2.8million shares of Company common stock valued at $85 million (1% of total plan assets) and $93 million (2% of total plan assets) at 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Fair Value Measurements of Plan Assets Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Companys defined benefit plan assets carried at fair value are classified in the following categories:  Level 1  Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets  Level 2  Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets  Level 3  Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets reported at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at October1, 2011 and October2, 2010.
Level 1 investments are valued based on observable market prices on the last trading day of the year. Investments in common and preferred stocks are valued based on the securities exchange-listed price or a brokers quote in an active market. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities are valued based on a brokers quote in an active market.
Level 2 investments are valued at estimated fair value at year-end. Investments in certain government and federal agency bonds, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and corporate bonds are valued using a brokers quote in a non-active market or an evaluated price based on a compilation of observable market information, such as benchmark yield curves, credit spreads and estimated default rates. Derivative financial instruments are valued based on models that incorporate observable inputs for the underlying securities, such as interest rates. Shares in money market and mutual funds are valued at the net asset value of the shares held by the Plan at year-end based on the fair value of the underlying investments.
Level 3 investments primarily consist of investments in limited partnerships, which are valued based on the Master Trusts pro-rata share of partnership holdings as of year-end. The fair value of the underlying investments are estimated using significant unobservable inputs (e.g., discounted cash flow models or relative valuation methods that incorporate comparable market information such as earnings and cash flow multiples from similar publicly traded companies or real estate properties).

In such cases, the Master Trust would be contractually obligated to make a cash capital contribution to the limited partnership at the time of a capital call. At October1, 2011, the total committed capital still uncalled and unpaid was $462 million.
Plan Contributions During fiscal 2011, the Company made contributions to its pension and postretirement medical plans totaling $935 million, which included discretionary contributions above the minimum requirements for pension plans. The Company currently expects pension and postretirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2012 to total approximately $325 million to $375 million. Final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2012 will be determined based on our January1, 2012 funding actuarial valuation which will be available in late fiscal 2012.
Estimated Future Benefit Payments The following table presents estimated future benefit payments for the next ten fiscal years: Pension Plans Postretirement MedicalPlans (1) 2012 $273 $39 2013 293 42 2014 319 46 2015 342 49 2016 368 53 2017  2021 2,333 340 (1) Estimated future benefit payments are net of expected Medicare subsidy receipts of $64 million.
Assumptions Actuarial assumptions, such as the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets and the healthcare cost trend rate, have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic benefit cost as well as the related benefit obligations.
Discount Rate The assumed discount rate for pension and postretirement medical plans reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Companys discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves.
93 Table of Contents Long-term rate of return on plan assets The long-term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments. When determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers long-term rates of return on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which the Company expects the pension funds to be invested. The following long-term rates of return by asset class were considered in setting the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption: Equity Securities 9% 11% Debt Securities 4%7% Alternative Investments 6%  14% Healthcare cost trend rate The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement medical benefit plans. For the 2011 actuarial valuation, we assumed an 8.00% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare claims with the rate decreasing in even increments over fourteen years until reaching 4.50%.
Sensitivity A one percentage point (ppt) change in the key assumptions would have had the following effects on the projected benefit obligations as of October1, 2011 and on cost for fiscal 2012: Discount Rate Expected Long-Term RateofReturn On Assets Assumed Healthcare Cost Trend Rate Increase/(decrease) Benefit Expense Projected Benefit Obligations Benefit Expense Net Periodic Postretirement Medical Cost Projected Benefit Obligations 1 ppt decrease $ 223 $ 1,876 $ 69 $ (38) $ (228) 1 ppt increase (193) (1,589) (69) 54 285 Multi-employer Plans The Company participates in various multi-employer pension plans under union and industry-wide agreements. In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the contributions to these plans, which are expensed as incurred, were $59 million, $60 million and $52 million, respectively.
Defined Contribution Plans The Company has savings and investment plans that allow eligible employees to allocate up to 50% of their salary through payroll deductions depending on the plan in which the employee participates. The Company matches 50% of the employees pre-tax contribution up to plan limits. In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the costs of these plans were $59 million, $54 million and $51 million, respectively.
12 Equity As of the filing date of this report, the Board of Directors had not yet declared a dividend related to fiscal 2011. The Company paid a $0.40 per share dividend ($756 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 related to fiscal 2010. The Company paid a $0.35 per share dividend ($653 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 related to fiscal 2009. The Company paid a $0.35 per share dividend ($648 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 related to fiscal 2008.

13 Equity-Based Compensation Under various plans, the Company may grant stock options and other equity-based awards to executive, management, and creative personnel. The Companys approach to long-term incentive compensation contemplates awards of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). Certain RSUs awarded to senior executives vest based upon the achievement of market and/or performance conditions (Performance RSUs).
Stock options are generally granted at exercise prices equal to or exceeding the market price at the date of grant and become exercisable ratably over a four-year period from the grant date. The following table summarizes contractual terms for our stock option grants: Grant dates ContractualTerm Prior to December 2005 10 years January 2005 through December 2010 7 years After December 2010 10 years At the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, options can occasionally extend up to 15 years after date of grant.
The following table summarizes vesting terms for our RSUs: Grant dates VestingTerms RSUs: Prior to January 2009 50% on each of the second and fourth anniversaries of the grant date Effective January 2009 Ratably over four years Performance RSUs: Prior to January 2010 50% on each of the second and fourth anniversaries of the grant date subject to achieving market and/or performance conditions Effective January 2010 Fully after three years, subject to achieving performance conditions In March 2011, shareholders of the Company approved the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, which increased the number of shares authorized to be awarded as grants by 64million shares. Shares available for future option and RSU grants at October1, 2011 totaled 70 million. Starting March 2009 for our primary plan, each share granted subject to a stock option award reduces the number of shares available by one share while each share granted subject to a RSU award reduces the number of shares available by two shares. The Company satisfies stock option exercises and vesting of RSUs with newly issued shares. Stock options and RSUs are generally forfeited by employees who terminate prior to vesting.
95 Table of Contents Each year, during the second quarter, the Company awards stock options and restricted stock units to a broad-based group of management and creative personnel (the Annual Grant). The fair value of options is estimated based on the binomial valuation model. The binomial valuation model takes into account variables such as volatility, dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate. The binomial valuation model also considers the expected exercise multiple (the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average) and the termination rate (the probability of a vested option being cancelled due to the termination of the option holder) in computing the value of the option.
In fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, the weighted average assumptions used in the option-valuation model were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Risk-free interest rate 3.2% 3.5% 2.0% Expected volatility 28% 32% 47% Dividend yield 1.15% 1.41% 1.19% Termination rate 2.5% 2.5% 7.5% Exercise multiple 1.40 1.40 1.39 Although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date, changes in the Companys assumptions may change the value of, and therefore the expense related to, future stock option grants. The assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value in the binomial valuation model are the expected volatility and expected exercise multiple. Increases or decreases in either the expected volatility or expected exercise multiple will cause the binomial option value to increase or decrease, respectively.
The volatility assumption considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the Companys performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions.
Compensation expense for RSUs and stock options is recognized ratably over the service period of the award. Compensation expense for RSUs is based on the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the grant date. Compensation expense for Performance RSUs reflects the estimated probability that the market and/or performance conditions will be met. Effective January 2010, equity-based awards provide continued vesting, in the event of termination, generally for employees that reach age 60 or greater, have at least ten years of service and hold the award for at least one year.
The impact of stock options/rights and RSUs on income for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Stock option/rights compensation expense (1) $ 133 $ 142 $ 154 RSU compensation expense 300 249 207 Total equity-based compensation expense ( 2 ) 433 391 361 Tax impact (151) (145) (134) Reduction in net income $ 282 $ 246 $ 227 Equity-based compensation expense capitalized during the period $ 66 $ 79 $ 109 Tax benefit reported in cash flow from financing activities $ 124 $ 76 $ 4 (1) Includes stock appreciation rights issued in connection with the acquisition of Playdom (2) Equity-based compensation expense is net of capitalized equity-based compensation and excludes amortization of previously capitalized equity-based compensation costs. Amortization of previously capitalized equity-based compensation totaled $57 million, $131 million and $96 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Approximately 3.0million of the unvested RSUs as of October1, 2011 are Performance RSUs.
The weighted average grant-date fair values of options granted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $10.96, $9.43 and $7.43, respectively. The total intrinsic value (market value on date of exercise less exercise price) of options exercised and RSUs vested during 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $969 million, $830 million, and $252 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic values of stock options vested and expected to vest at October1, 2011 were $170 million and $68 million, respectively.
As of October1, 2011, there was $187 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and $618 million related to unvested RSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years for stock options and 1.7 years for RSUs.
Cash received from option exercises for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $1,128 million, $1,133 million and $119 million, respectively. Tax benefits realized from tax deductions associated with option exercises and RSU activity for 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $342 million, $290 million and $90 million, respectively.

15 Commitments and Contingencies Commitments The Company has various contractual commitments for broadcast rights for sports, feature films and other programming, aggregating approximately $36.1 billion, including approximately $0.7 billion for available programming as of October1, 2011, and approximately $33.3 billion related to sports programming rights, primarily NFL, college football (including college bowl games) and basketball conferences, NBA, NASCAR, and MLB.
The Company has entered into operating leases for various real estate and equipment needs, including retail outlets and distribution centers for consumer products, broadcast equipment, and office space for general and administrative purposes. Rental expense for the operating leases during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, including common-area maintenance and contingent rentals, was $820 million, $742 million, and $694 million, respectively.
The Company also has contractual commitments for the construction of one new cruise ship, creative talent and employment agreements and unrecognized tax benefits. Creative talent and employment agreements include obligations to actors, producers, sports personnel, television and radio personalities, and executives.

Accumulated amortization related to these capital leases totaled $127 million and $108 million at October1, 2011 and October2, 2010, respectively. Future payments under these leases as of October1, 2011 are as follows: 2012 $ 70 2013 59 2014 51 2015 60 2016 27 Thereafter 519 Total minimum obligations $ 786 Less amount representing interest (480) Present value of net minimum obligations 306 Less current portion (18) Long-term portion $ 288 Contractual Guarantees The Company has guaranteed bond issuances by the Anaheim Public Authority that were used by the City of Anaheim to finance construction of infrastructure and a public parking facility adjacent to the Disneyland Resort. Revenues from sales, occupancy and property taxes from the Disneyland Resort and non-Disney hotels are used by the City of Anaheim to repay the bonds. In the event of a debt service shortfall, the Company will be responsible to fund the shortfall. As of October1, 2011, the remaining debt service obligation guaranteed by the Company was $359 million, of which $87 million was principal. To the extent that tax revenues exceed the debt service payments in subsequent periods, the Company would be reimbursed for any previously funded shortfalls. To date, tax revenues have exceeded the debt service payments for Anaheim bonds.
ESPN STAR Sports, a joint-venture in which ESPN owns a 50% equity interest, has an agreement for global programming rights to International Cricket Council Events from 2007 through 2015. Under the terms of the agreement, ESPN and the other joint-venture partner have jointly guaranteed the programming rights obligation of approximately $0.7 billion over the remaining term of the agreement.
Legal Matters Celador International Ltd. v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.
On May19, 2004, an affiliate of the creator and licensor of the television program, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, filed an action against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. and Buena Vista Television, LLC, alleging it was damaged by defendants improperly engaging in certain intra-company transactions and charging merchandise distribution expenses, resulting in an underpayment to the plaintiff.On July7, 2010, the jury returned a verdict for breach of contract againstcertain subsidiaries of the Company, awarding plaintiff damages of $269.4 million.The Company has stipulated with the plaintiff to an award of prejudgment interest of $50 million, which amount will be reduced pro rata should the Court of Appeals reduce the damages amount. On December21, 2010, the Companys alternative motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law were denied. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, the Company believes the jurys verdict is in error and is vigorously pursuing its position on appeal, notice of which was filed by the Company on January14, 2011. On or about January28, 2011, plaintiff filed a notice of cross-appeal. The Company has determined that it does not have a probable loss under the applicable accounting standard relating to probability of loss for recording a reserve with respect to this litigation and therefore has not recorded a reserve.
The Company, together with, in some instances, certain of its directors and officers, is a defendant or codefendant in various other legal actions involving copyright, breach of contract and various other claims incident to the conduct of its businesses. Management does not expect the Company to suffer any material liability by reason of these actions.
Long-Term Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses The Company has accounts receivable with original maturities greater than one year in duration principally related to the Companys sales of program rights in the television syndication markets within the Media Networks segment and vacation ownership units within the Parks and Resorts segment.
100 Table of Contents The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses related to receivables for the sale of syndicated programming based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, and an ongoing review of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. The balance of syndication receivables recorded in other non-current assets, net of an immaterial allowance for credit losses, was approximately $0.9 billion as of October1, 2011. Activity in fiscal 2011 related to the allowance for credit losses was not material.
The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses related to receivables for sales of its vacation ownership units based primarily on historical collection experience. Projections of uncollectible amounts are also based on consideration of the economic environment and the age of receivables. The balance of mortgage receivables recorded in other non-current assets, net of a related allowance for credit losses of approximately 5%, was approximately $0.5 billion as of October1, 2011. The activity in fiscal 2011 related to the allowance for credit losses was not material.
16 Fair Value Measurement The Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized in the following table by the type of inputs applicable to the fair value measurements. See Note 11 for the definitions of fair value and each level within the fair value hierarchy.
FairValueMeasurementsatOctober1,2011 Description Level1 Level2 Level3 Total Assets Investments $ 143 $ 43 $  $ 186 Derivatives (1) Interest rate  214  214 Foreign exchange  498  498 Residual Interests   40 40 Liabilities Derivatives (1) Interest rate  (18 )  (18 ) Foreign exchange  (262 )  (262 ) Other derivatives  (1 )  (1 ) Other     Total $ 143 $ 474 $ 40 $ 657 Fair Value Measurements at October2, 2010 Description Level1 Level2 Level3 Total Assets Investments $ 42 $ 42 $ 2 $ 86 Derivatives (1) Interest rate  231  231 Foreign exchange  404  404 Residual Interests   54 54 Liabilities Derivatives (1) Interest rate  (22 )  (22 ) Foreign exchange  (490 )  (490 ) Other derivatives     Other   (1 ) (1 ) Total $ 42 $ 165 $ 55 $ 262 (1) The Company has master netting arrangements by counterparty with respect to certain derivative contracts. Contracts in a liability position totaling $167 million and $206 million have been netted against contracts in an asset position in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at October1, 2011 and October2, 2010, respectively.
The fair value of Level 2 investments is primarily determined by reference to market prices based on recent trading activity and other relevant information including pricing for similar securities as determined by third-party pricing services.
101 Table of Contents The fair values of Level 2 derivatives, which consist of interest rate and foreign currency hedges, are primarily determined based on the present value of future cash flows using internal models that use observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves and foreign currency exchange rates. Counterparty credit risk, which is mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral posting arrangements with certain counterparties, did not have a material impact on derivative fair value estimates.
Level 3 residual interests consist of our residual interests in securitized vacation ownership mortgage receivables and are valued using a discounted cash flow model that considers estimated interest rates, discount rates, prepayment, and defaults. There were no material changes in the residual interests in fiscal 2011.
The Company also has assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis when certain circumstances occur. During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded impairment charges of $46 million and $249 million, respectively, on film productions which are reported in Costs and expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The film impairment charges compared our estimated fair value using discounted cash flows to the unamortized cost of the films. The discounted cash flow analysis is a level 3 valuation technique. The aggregate carrying values of the films were $132 million and $591 million prior to the impairment charges for fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments In addition to the financial instruments listed above, the Companys financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and borrowings.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, available-for-sale investments, derivative contracts and accounts payable approximated the carrying values. The estimated year end fair values of the Companys total borrowings (current and noncurrent) subject to fair value disclosures, determined based on broker quotes or quoted market prices or interest rates for the same or similar instruments are $14.2 billion and $13.7 billion at October1, 2011 and October2, 2010, respectively.
Transfers of Financial Assets The Company previously sold mortgage receivables arising from the sales of its vacation ownership units under a facility that expired on December4, 2008 and was not renewed.The Company sold $17 million of mortgage receivables during the year ended October3, 2009, resulting in gain on securitized sales of vacation ownership interests of $4 million for fiscal 2009.
The Company continues to service the sold receivables and has a residual interest in those receivables. As of October1, 2011, the remaining outstanding principal amount for sold mortgage receivables was $236 million, and the carrying value of the Companys residual interest, which is recorded in other long-term assets, was $40 million.
The Company repurchases defaulted mortgage receivables at their outstanding balance. The Company did not make material repurchases in the years ended October1, 2011 or October2, 2010. The Company generally has been able to sell the repurchased vacation ownership units for amounts that exceed the amounts at which they were repurchased.
The Company also provides credit support for up to 70% of the outstanding balance of the sold mortgage receivables which the mortgage receivable acquirer may draw on in the event of losses under the facility. The Company maintains a reserve for estimated credit losses related to these receivables.
Credit Concentrations The Company continually monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments and does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.
The Company does not expect that it would realize a material loss, based on the fair value of its derivative financial instruments as of October1, 2011, in the event of nonperformance by any single derivative counterparty. The Company enters into transactions only with derivative counterparties that have a credit rating of A- or better. The Companys current policy regarding agreements with derivative counterparties is generally to require collateral in the event credit ratings fall below A- or in the event aggregate exposures exceed limits as defined by contract. In addition, the Company limits the amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution.
The Company does not have material cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that have a credit rating of less than investment grade. As of October1, 2011, the Companys balances that exceeded 10% of cash and cash equivalents with individual financial institutions were 41% compared to 30% as of October2, 2010.
102 Table of Contents The Companys trade receivables and financial investments do not represent a significant concentration of credit risk at October1, 2011 due to the wide variety of customers and markets into which the Companys products are sold, their dispersion across geographic areas, and the diversification of the Companys portfolio among issuers.
17 Derivative Instruments The Company manages its exposure to various risks relating to its ongoing business operations according to a risk management policy. The primary risks managed with derivative instruments are interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.
The following table summarizes the gross fair value of the Companys derivative positions as of October1, 2011: Current Assets OtherAssets Other Accrued Liabilities OtherLong- Term Liabilities Derivatives designated as hedges Foreign exchange $ 133 $ 33 $ (100) $ (90) Interest rate 1 213   Other   (1)  Derivatives not designated as hedges Foreign exchange 103 229 (51) (21) Interest rate    (18) Gross fair value of derivatives 237 475 (152) (129) Counterparty netting (111) (56) 111 56 Total Derivatives (1) $ 126 $ 419 $ (41) $ (73) The following table summarizes the gross fair value of the Companys derivative positions as of October2, 2010: Current Assets OtherAssets Other Accrued Liabilities OtherLong- Term Liabilities Derivatives designated as hedges Foreign exchange $ 78 $ 65 $ (210) $ (104) Interest rate 13 218   Derivatives not designated as hedges Foreign exchange 80 181 (140) (36) Interest rate    (22) Gross fair value of derivatives 171 464 (350) (162) Counterparty netting (121) (85) 130 76 Total Derivatives (1) $ 50 $ 379 $ (220) $ (86) (1) Refer to Note 16 for further information on derivative fair values and counterparty netting.
Interest Rate Risk Management The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through its borrowing activities. The Companys objective is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and on the market value of its borrowings. In accordance with its policy, the Company targets its fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage. The Company typically uses pay-floating and pay-fixed interest rate swaps to facilitate its interest rate management activities.
103 Table of Contents The Company designates pay-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate borrowings effectively converting fixed-rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to LIBOR. As of October1, 2011 and October2, 2010, the total notional amount of the Companys pay-floating interest rate swaps was $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. The following table summarizes adjustments related to fair value hedges included in net interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
2011 2010 Gain (loss) on interest rate swaps $ 17 $ 41 Gain (loss) on hedged borrowings (17) (41) The Company may designate pay-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest payments on floating-rate borrowings. Pay-fixed swaps effectively convert floating rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and recognized in interest expense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at October1, 2011 nor at October2, 2010.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management The Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes, enabling management to focus on core business issues and challenges.
The Company enters into option and forward contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and British pound. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency-denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.
The Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of October1, 2011 and October2, 2010, the notional amounts of the Companys net foreign exchange cash flow hedges was $3.6 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Mark to market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Gains and losses recognized related to ineffectiveness for the years ended October1, 2011 and October2, 2010 were not material. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months totaled $33 million. The following table summarizes the pre-tax adjustments to AOCI for foreign exchange cash flow hedges.
2011 2010 Gain (loss) recorded in AOCI $ (115) $ (187) Reclassification of (gains) losses from AOCI into revenues and costs and expenses 191 (7) Net change in AOCI $ 76 $ (194) Foreign exchange risk management contracts with respect to foreign currency assets and liabilities are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The notional amount of these foreign exchange contracts at October1, 2011 and October2, 2010 was $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. During the years ended October1, 2011 and October2, 2010, the Company recognized a net gain of $24 million and $102 million, respectively, in costs and expenses on these foreign exchange contracts which offset a net loss of $25 million and $173 million on the related economic exposures for the years ended October1, 2011 and October2, 2010, respectively.
Commodity Price Risk Management The Company is subject to the volatility of commodities prices and designates certain commodity forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity purchases. Mark to market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of commodity purchases. The fair value of commodity hedging contracts was not material at October1, 2011 nor at October2, 2010.
104 Table of Contents Risk Management  Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges The Company enters into certain other risk management contracts that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. These contracts, which include pay fixed interest rate swaps and commodity swap contracts, are intended to offset economic exposures of the Company and are carried at market value with any changes in value recorded in earnings.
The notional amount of these contracts at October1, 2011 and October2, 2010 was $184 million and $218 million, respectively. The gains or losses recognized in income for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were not material.
Contingent Features The Companys derivative financial instruments may require the Company to post collateral in the event that a net liability position with a counterparty exceeds limits defined by contract and that vary with Disneys credit rating. If the Companys credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, such counterparties would also have the right to terminate our derivative contracts, which could lead to a net payment to or from the Company for the aggregate net value by counterparty of our derivative contracts. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a net liability position by counterparty were $114 million and $306 million on October1, 2011 and October2, 2010, respectively.
18 Restructuring and Impairment Charges The Company recorded $55 million of restructuring and impairment charges during fiscal 2011 for severance and facilities costs related to organizational and cost structure initiatives primarily at our Studio Entertainment ($33 million) and Interactive Media ($22 million) segments.
The Company recorded $270 million of restructuring and impairment charges during fiscal 2010 related to organizational and cost structure initiatives primarily at our Studio Entertainment ($151 million) and Media Networks ($95 million) segments. Impairment charges of $132 million consisted of writeoffs of capitalized costs primarily related to abandoned film projects, the closure of a studio production facility and the closure of five ESPN Zone locations. Restructuring charges of $138 million were primarily severance and other costs.
The Company recorded $492 million of restructuring and impairment charges during fiscal 2009 which included impairment charges of $279 million and restructuring costs of $213 million.
