_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Statements in this report not based on historical facts are considered forward-looking and, accordingly, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed. Although such forward-looking statements have been made in good faith and are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that the expected results will be achieved. These statements include (without limitation) statements as to future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions, and financial performance. In connection with the safe harbor provi-sions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are providing this cautionary statement to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. The following factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report and in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially from management expectations as suggested by such forward-looking statements:  regulatory       actions, including changes in regulatory policies and ratemaking       determinations;  changes       in laws and other governmental actions, including monetary and fiscal       policies;  the       effects of increased competition in the future due to, among other things,       deregulation of certain aspects of our business at both the state and       federal levels, and the implementation of deregulation, such as when the       current electric rate freeze and current power supply contracts expire in       Illinois in 2006;  the       effects of participation in the MISO;  the       availability of fuel for the production of electricity, such as coal and       natural gas, and purchased power and natural gas for distribution, and the       level and volatility of future market prices for such commodities,       including the ability to recover any increased costs;  the       effectiveness of our risk management strategies and the use of financial       and derivative instruments;  prices       for power in the Midwest;  business       and economic conditions, including their impact on interest rates;  disruptions       of the capital markets or other events that make the Ameren Companies       access to necessary capital more difficult or costly;  the       impact of the adoption of new accounting standards and the application of       appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance;  actions       of credit ratings agencies and the effects of such actions;  weather       conditions and other natural phenomena;  generation       plant construction, installation and performance;  operation       of UEs nuclear power facility, including planned and unplanned outages,       and decommissioning costs;  the       effects of strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and divestitures;  the       impact of current environmental regulations on utilities and power       generating companies and the expectation that more stringent requirements       will be introduced over time, which could have a negative financial       effect;  labor       disputes, future wages and employee benefits costs, including changes in       returns on benefit plan assets;  difficulties       in integrating IP with Amerens other businesses;  changes       in the energy markets, environmental laws or regulations, interest rates,       or other factors that could adversely affect assumptions in connection       with the CILCORP and IP acquisitions; 7  the       impact of conditions imposed by regulators in connection with their       approval of Amerens acquisition of IP;  the       inability of our counterparties to meet their obligations with respect to       our contracts and financial instruments;  the       cost and availability of transmission capacity for the energy generated by       the Ameren Companies generating facilities       or required to satisfy energy sales made by the Ameren Companies;  legal       and administrative proceedings; and  acts       of sabotage, war or terrorist activities.

Except to the extent required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, future events, or otherwise.
PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
GENERAL Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company registered with the SEC under the PUHCA. Ameren was formed in 1997 by the merger of UE and CIPSCO, the former parent company of CIPS. Ameren acquired CILCORP in 2003 and IP in 2004. Amerens primary asset is the common stock of its subsidiaries, including UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP. Amerens subsidiaries operate rate-regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses, rate-regulated natural gas distribution businesses, and non-rate-regulated electric generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois. Dividends on Amerens common stock are dependent on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a more detailed description of the Ameren Companies and the development of their businesses.
The following table presents our total employees at December 31, 2004: Ameren UE CIPS Genco CILCORP (parent) CILCO IP 9,388 (a) 3,944 754 596 4 769 1,722 (a) Total for Ameren includes Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant subsidiaries.
The IBEW, the IUOE, the NCF&O, and the Laborers and Gas Fitters labor unions represent approximately 63% of Amerens total employees, and 73%, 68%, 67%, 63%, 63% and 70% of the employees of UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP, respectively. An IBEW contract representing a portion of UE workers expires in 2006. Contracts with the Laborers and Gas Fitters labor unions that represent a portion of IP employees also expire in 2006. IP is in discussions to have those agreements extended. The remaining agreements covering UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP employees expire in 2007.
For additional information regarding our business operations and factors affecting our operations and financial position, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report and Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. For additional information regarding reporting segments, see Note 18 - Segment Information to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
RATES AND REGULATION Rates Rates that UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are allowed to charge for their services are the single most important item influencing their and Amerens consolidated results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The rates charged to UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP customers are determined by governmental organizations. Decisions by these organizations are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, the quality of service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, economic conditions, public policy, and social and political views. Decisions made by these organizations regarding rates could have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position and liquidity of UE, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and Ameren on a consolidated basis.
UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are subject to regulation by the ICC. UE is also subject to regulation by the MoPSC, as to rates, service, issuance of equity securities, issuance of debt having a maturity of more than 12 months, mergers, affiliate transactions, and various other matters. Genco is not subject to regulation by the ICC or the MoPSC. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding UEs proposed discontinuance of its utility operations subject to ICC 8 jurisdiction by transferring its Illinois-based electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business to CIPS.
UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP are also subject to regulation by the FERC as to their ability to charge market-based rates in connection with the wholesale sale of energy and transmission in interstate commerce, mergers, affiliate transactions, and various other matters. Less than 5% of our electric revenues relate to transmission revenues regulated by the FERC. Issuance of short-term and long-term debt by Genco is subject to approval by the FERC.
The following table presents the approximate percentage of electric operating revenues subject to regulation by the MoPSC and the ICC for each of the Ameren Companies for the year ended December 31, 2004: MoPSC ICC Ameren (a) 46% 36% UE 79 6 CIPS - 92 Genco - - CILCORP - 88 CILCO - 88 IP - 100 (a) Includes amounts for IP since the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.
The following table presents the approximate percentage of gas operating revenues subject to regulation by the MoPSC and the ICC for each of the Ameren Companies for the year ended December 31, 2004: MoPSC ICC Ameren (a) 16% 84% UE 87 13 CIPS - 100 CILCORP - 100 CILCO - 100 IP - 100 (a) Includes amounts for IP since the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.
If certain criteria are met, UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs electric and gas rates may be adjusted without the necessity of a traditional rate proceeding. PGA clauses allow for prudently incurred natural gas purchase costs to be passed directly to the consumer in Missouri and Illinois. There is no similar provision that would allow regulated electric operations fuel or purchased power costs to pass directly to the consumer. Environmental adjustment rate riders authorized by the ICC permit the recovery of prudently incurred MGP remediation and litigation costs from UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs Illinois electric and natural gas utility customers. As a part of the order approving Amerens acquisition of IP, the ICC authorized IP to implement a tariff rider to recover 90% of the costs of asbestos-related litigation claims in excess of $20 million from its electric utility customers, subject to certain terms, beginning in 2007. MoPSC natural gas pipeline replacement cost clauses allow the recovery of infrastructure replacement costs from gas utility customers. However, UE agreed to not seek recovery under these clauses before January 1, 2006, in conjunction with its 2003 Missouri gas rate case settlement.
For further information on rate matters, including UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement, UEs 2004 Missouri gas rate case settlement, IPs 2004 pending gas rate case, and the ending of rate moratoriums in Missouri and Illinois in 2006, see Results of Operations in Managements Dis-cussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, and Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
General Regulatory Matters As a holding company registered with the SEC under the PUHCA, Ameren is subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA, including provisions relating to the issuance of securities, sales and acquisitions of securities and utility assets, affiliate transactions, financial reporting requirements, the services performed by Ameren Services and AFS, and the activities of certain other subsidi-aries. Issuance of common stock and short-term and long-term debt and other securities by Ameren and CILCORP and issuance of debt having a maturity of 12 months or less by UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are subject to approval by the SEC under the PUHCA.
Genco is certified by the FERC as an exempt wholesale generator under the Energy Policy Act of 1992; Genco is not a public utility company under the PUHCA. As an exempt wholesale generator, Genco is exempt from most of the provisions of the PUHCA that otherwise would apply to it as a subsidiary of a registered holding company. Issuance of securities by Genco is not subject to approval by the SEC under the PUHCA. The SEC may impose limitations on Ameren in connection with its financing for the purpose of investing in exempt wholesale generators and foreign utility companies if Amerens aggregate investment in those activities exceeds 50% of its consolidated retained earnings. At December 31, 2004, Amerens aggregate invest-ment in exempt wholesale generators was 32% of its consolidated retained earnings. Ameren has no investment in foreign utility companies.
Operation of UEs Callaway nuclear plant is subject to regulation by the NRC. Its Facility Operating License expires on October18, 2024. UEs Osage hydroelectric plant and UEs Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydro plant, as licensed projects under the Federal Power Act, are subject to the FERC regulations affecting, among other things, the general operation and maintenance of the projects. The license for the Osage plant expires on February 28, 2006, and the license for the Taum Sauk plant expires on June 30, 2010. In November 9 2004, the FERC formally accepted UEs February 2004 license renewal application and solicited terms and conditions from the U.S. Department of Interior and various state agencies to renew the license for its Osage hydroelectric plant for an additional 50-year term. UEs Keokuk plant and dam located in the Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois and Keokuk, Iowa, are operated under authority, unlimited in time, granted by an Act of Congress in 1905.
For information on regulatory matters, see Regulatory Matters in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report and Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
Environmental Matters Certain of our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental statutes or regulations relating to the safety and health of personnel, the public, and the environment, including the identification, generation, storage, handling, transportation, disposal, record-keeping, labeling, reporting of and emergency response in connection with hazardous and toxic materials, safety and health standards, and environmental protection requirements, including stan-dards and limitations relating to the discharge of air and water pollutants. Failure to comply with those statutes or regulations could have material adverse effects on us, including the imposition of criminal or civil liability by regulatory agencies or civil fines and liability to private parties, and the required expenditure of funds to bring us into compliance. We believe that we are in material compliance with existing statutes and regulations.
For additional discussion of environmental matters, including potential NO x, SO 2, and mercury emission reduction requirements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
SUPPLY FOR ELECTRIC POWER During 2004, the Ameren Companies peak demand from retail and wholesale customers was 15,991 megawatts and the peak capability to deliver power from owned generation and power supply agreements was 19,439 megawatts. Forecasted peak demand from retail and wholesale customers for 2005 is 17,441 megawatts. Ameren-owned generation and purchased power are used to meet the energy needs of our customers with a 15% reserve margin. Factors that could cause us to purchase power include, among other things, absence of sufficient owned generation, generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, and the availability of power at a cost lower than our cost of generating it.
The acquisition of IP included IPs rate-regulated electric and gas transmission and distribution business. IP owns no significant generation assets; it obtains almost all of the electricity that it supplies to retail customers through short-term and long-term power purchase agreements. For additional information on IPs power purchase agreements, see Note 2 - Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
The following table presents the source of electric generation, excluding purchased power, used for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Coal Nuclear Natural       Gas Hydro Oil Ameren: (a) 2004 86 % 10 % 1 % 2 % 1 % 2003 85 13 (b ) 1 1 2002 82 13 2 2 1 UE: 2004 80 % 17 % (b ) 3 % (b ) 2003 77 21 (b ) 2 (b ) 2002 77 20 (b ) - 3 Genco: 2004 93 % - 2 % - 5 % 2003 95 - 2 - 3 2002 88 - 8 - 4 CILCORP       and CILCO: (c) 2004 99 % - 1 % - (b ) 2003 100 - (b ) - (b ) 2002 100 - (b ) - (b ) (a) Excludes amount for CILCORP and CILCO prior to the acquisition date of January 31, 2003; includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.

(b) The fuel cost for natural gas represents the actual cost of natural gas and variable costs for transportation, storage, balancing, and fuel losses for delivery to the plant. In addition, the fixed costs for firm transportation and firm storage capacity are included to calculate a fully loaded fuel cost for the generating facilities.
(c) Represents all costs for fuels utilized in our electric generating facilities, to the extent applicable, including coal, nuclear, natural gas, oil, propane, tire chips, and handling.
(d) 2002 amounts represent predecessor information. CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances.
Coal UE, Genco and CILCO have agreements in place for the purchase of coal to supply electric generating facilities through 2010. Coal supply agreements typically have an initial term of five years, with approximately 20% of the contracts expiring annually. As of December 31, 2004, almost 92% of UEs, Gencos and CILCOs expected 2005 coal usage was under contract, and approximately 58% of the expected coal usage for 2006 to 2009 was under contract. Ameren burned 38 million tons of coal in 2004.
UE, Genco and CILCO have a policy of maintaining coal inventory consistent with their historical usage. Inventory levels may be adjusted because of uncertainties of supply due to potential work stoppages, delays in coal deliveries, equipment breakdowns, and other factors. The following table presents the number of days supply of coal in inventory as of December 31, 2004 and 2003: 2004 2003 Ameren 55 56 UE 64 59 Genco 48 55 CILCORP and       CILCO 15 38 Nuclear UE has agreements or inventories to fulfill its Callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium and conversion, enrichment and fabrication services through 2006. UE expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel. UE is a member of Fuelco, which provides benefits to UE and Fuelcos other members in all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle. UE is able to combine its fuel needs with the other members, and thereby increase its purchasing power and the opportunities for volume discount pricing. In addition, Fuelco is able to pursue sources of supply that would not otherwise be available to UE alone. Diversification of supply is enhanced and security of supply is better managed collectively. In fuel fabrication, UE is able to draw upon the expertise of the other members to enhance fuel performance. The Callaway nuclear plant normally requires refueling at 18-month intervals. The last refueling took place in May and June 2004; the next refueling is scheduled for September 2005.
Natural Gas Supply for Power Generation Our natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas to our generating units. We do this by optimizing transportation and storage options; by minimizing cost and price risk through various supply and price hedging agreements that allow us to maintain access to multiple gas pools, supply basins, and storage; and by reducing the impact of price volatility. For 2005, 96% of the estimated required natural gas supply for generation was under contract; 35% of the required gas supply was hedged for price risk as of December 31, 2004.
11 Purchased Power We believe that we can obtain enough purchased power to meet future needs. However, during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power may be significantly affected. The Ameren transmission system has a minimum of 18 direct connections to other control areas, which allow access to numerous sources of supply. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are members of the MISO. Effective April 1, 2005, the MISO is expected to begin operating a newly designed market that is expected to offer improved transparency of power pricing and efficiency in generation dispatch.
Through the end of 2006, CIPS, CILCO and IP have contracts in place to supply almost all of their power needs. For a description of IPs primary power supply contract with Dynegy and a description of CIPS and CILCOs power supply contracts with affiliates, see Note 2 - Acquisitions and Note 14 - Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
On December 31, 2006, the current Illinois electric rate freeze expires, as do the supply contracts for generation to serve the power requirements of CIPS, CILCO and IP. Prior to December 31, 2006, determinations must be made as to how all Illinois electric distribution companies will procure their generation needs and how they will set future rates for the generation components and delivery service components of customer rates.
During 2004, the ICC held workshops to get input from interested parties on the framework to be used for retail electric rate determination and generation procurement after the current Illinois electric rate freeze and supply contracts expire on December 31, 2006. A report issued by the ICC in late 2004, outlined a process that received strong support in the workshops: It would have CIPS, CILCO and IP procure power through an auction monitored by the ICC. The form of power supply would meet the full requirements of the utility, and the risk of fluctuations in power requirements would be borne by the supplier. In addition, the report noted that many stakeholders, including Ameren, supported a process whereby the price of power resulting from the auction would be the price used to determine the generation component of customer rates. This price of power would be charged to customers by a pass-through mechanism. With regard to the delivery service component of customer rates, it is expected that all Illinois delivery service companies will file rate cases, at which time the delivery service component of customer rates will be updated. Genco and AERG would probably participate in the auction, but there may be a limit imposed by the ICC on the maximum amount of power they could supply CIPS, CILCO and IP. In February 2005, CIPS, CILCO and IP filedwith the ICC: A proposed format for the generation procurement auction, a rate mechanism to pass generation costs through to customers, and a process to update the delivery service portion of rates, among other things. These proposals are subject to review and approval by the ICC within 11 months of the filings. In addition, the Illinois legislature began hearings in February 2005 regarding the framework for retail rate determination and generation procurement. We cannot predict what actions, if any, the Illinois legislature will take, or whether the ICC will approve our proposals for generation procurement or electric rate determination.
NATURAL GAS SUPPLY FOR DISTRIBUTION UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are responsible for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to their gas utility customers. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP develop and manage a portfolio of gas supply resources, including firm gas supply under term agreements with producers, interstate and intrastate firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity leased from interstate pipelines, and on-system storage facilities to maintain gas deliveries to our customers throughout the year and especially during periods of peak demand. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP primarily use the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, Trunkline Gas Company, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, Mississippi River Transmission Corporation, and Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation interstate pipeline systems for transportation of natural gas to our systems. In addition to physical transactions, financial instruments, including the NYMEX futures market and OTC financial markets are used to hedge the price paid for natural gas. Prudently incurred natural gas purchase costs are passed on to UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP gas customers in Illinois and Missouri dollar-for-dollar under PGA clauses, subject to review by the ICC and the MoPSC.

INDUSTRY ISSUES We are facing issues common to the electric and gas utility industry. These issues include:  the       potential for more intense competition in generation and       supply;  the       potential for changes in the structure of regulation;  changes       in the structure of the industry as a result of changes in federal and       state laws, including the 12 formation       of non-rate-regulated generating entities and regional transmission       organizations;  fluctuations       in power prices due to the balance of supply and demand and commodity       prices;  continually       developing and complex environmental laws, regulations and issues,       including proposed new air-quality standards;  public       concern about the siting of new facilities;  construction       of new power generating facilities;  proposals       for programs to encourage energy efficiency and renewable sources of       power;  public       concerns about nuclear plant operation and decommissioning and the       disposal of nuclear waste;  consolidation       of electric and gas companies; and  global       climate issues.
We are monitoring these issues. We are unable to predict at this time what impact, if any, these issues will have on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. For additional information, see Outlook and Regulatory Matters in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report and Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
RISK FACTORS Ameren may not be able to integrate IP successfully into its other businesses or achieve the benefits it anticipates.
Ameren cannot ensure that it will be able to integrate IP successfully with its other businesses. The integration of IP with its other businesses will present significant challenges; Ameren may not be able to operate the combined company as effectively as expected. Ameren may also fail to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition as quickly or as cost- effectively as anticipated; it may not be able to achieve those benefits at all. Ameren expects that this acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in the first two years. This expectation is based on important assumptions, which may be incorrect, including assumptions related to expected financing arrangements, regulatory treatment, interest rates, market prices for power, and synergies. As a result, if Ameren is unable to integrate its businesses effectively or to achieve the benefits anticipated, its results of operations, financial position, and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.
The electric and gas rates that certain Ameren Companies are allowed to charge in Missouri and Illinois are largely set through 2006. These rate freezes, along with other actions of regulators that can significantly affect our earnings, liquidity, and business activities, are largely outside our control.
The rates that certain Ameren Companies are allowed to charge for their services are the single most important item influencing the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of the Ameren Companies. Our industry is highly regulated. The regulation of the rates that we charge our customers is determined, in large part, by governmental organizations outside of our control, including the MoPSC, the ICC, and the FERC. We are also subject to regulation by the SEC under the PUHCA. Decisions made by these regulators could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
As a part of the settlement of UEs Missouri electric rate case in 2002, UE is subject to a rate moratorium that prohibits changes in its electric rates in Missouri before July 1, 2006, subject to limited statutory and other exceptions. In addition, a provision of the Illinois legislation related to the restructuring of the Illinois electric industry put a rate freeze into effect in Illinois until January1, 2007, for UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. This Illinois legislation also requires that 50% of the earnings from each respective Illinois jurisdiction in excess of certain levels be refunded to UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs Illinois customers through 2006. Furthermore, as part of the settlement of UEs Missouri gas rate case, which was approved by the MoPSC on January13, 2004, UE agreed to a rate moratorium. It will make no changes in its gas delivery rates prior to July1, 2006, subject to certain exceptions. Also, in the order approving Amerens acquisition of IP, the ICC prohibited IP from filing for any proposed increase in gas delivery rates to be effective prior to January 1, 2007, beyond IPs pending request for a gas delivery rate increase. The ICC conducted workshops seeking input from interested parties on the framework to be used for retail rate determination and for generation procurement by customers after the current Illinois rate freeze and supply contracts end in 2006.
As a part of the settlement of UEs Missouri electric rate case in 2002, UE also undertook to use commercially reasonable efforts to make critical energy infrastructure investments of $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion from January1, 2002 through June30, 2006, for among other things, the addition of more than 700 megawatts of new generation capacity. UE added 240 megawatts of CTs in 2002. UE is also seeking to acquire 550 megawatts of CTs from Genco in 2005. Ameren also committed IP to make between $275 million and $325 million in energy infrastructure investments over its first two years of ownership, in conjunction with the ICCs approval of Amerens acquisition of IP. UEs agreement to a rate moratorium in Missouri and UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs rate freezes mean that capital expenditures will not become recoverable in rates, and will not earn a return, before July 1, 2006, for UE and January 1, 2007, for CIPS, CILCO and IP. Therefore, undertakings with respect to energy infrastructure investments and funding new programs, coupled with the rate reductions and rate moratoriums, could result in increased financing requirements for UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP and thus have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
13 The Ameren Companies do not have in either Missouri or Illinois a fuel adjustment clause for their electric operations that would allow them to recover from customers costs for purchased power or increased fuel used for generation. Therefore, to the extent that we have not hedged our fuel and power costs, we are exposed to changes in fuel and power prices to the extent that fuel for our electric generating facilities and power must be purchased on the open market in order for us to serve our customers.
Steps taken and being considered at the federal and state levels continue to change the structure of the electric industry and utility regulation. At the federal level, the FERC has been mandating changes in the regulatory framework for transmission-owning public utilities such as UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. In Missouri, restructuring bills have been introduced in the past, but no legislation has been passed. In Illinois, which since the acquisition of IP, supplies over 50% of Amerens electric revenues, the Illinois Customer Choice Law provides for electric utility restructuring and retail competition.
Principally because of rate reductions and rate moratoriums that affect certain Ameren Companies, increased costs and investments have resulted in decreased returns in our distribution utility businesses. In 2005, Ameren will begin the process for preparing and filing proposals for utility rate adjustments in Illinois and Missouri to take effect after the expiration of the applicable rate moratoriums.
We are not able to predict what rate treatment certain Ameren Companies will receive after the rate moratoriums expire in Missouri and Illinois. There are currently activities under way in Illinois to determine the framework for retail electric rate determination and generation procurement after the current Illinois electric rate freeze and supply contracts expire in 2006. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. In response to competitive, economic, political, legislative and regulatory pressures, we may be subject to further rate moratoriums, rate refunds, or rate reductions, any and all of which could have a significant adverse affect on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
Increased federal and state environmental regulation could require UE, Genco and CILCO to incur large capital expenditures and increase operating costs.
Approximately 65% of Amerens generating capacity is coal-fired. The balance is nuclear, gas-fired, hydro, and oil-fired. The EPA issued proposed regulations with respect to SO 2 , NO x , and mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. These new rules, if adopted, would require significant additional reductions in these emissions from our power plants in phases, beginning in 2010. The EPA has delayed finalization of the proposed rules so that Congress may first consider the Bush Administrations Clear Skies legislation. The Clear Skies legislation calls for roughly 70% cuts in NO x , SO 2 , and mercury emissions, phased in through 2018. Clear Skies legislation will probably be introduced in the U.S. Congress and debated in 2005. Preliminary estimates of capital costs, based on Ameren systems current technology, to comply with the EPA proposed SO 2 , NO x , and mercury emission regulations, range from $1.4 billion to $1.9 billion by 2015.
Future initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global warming continue to be the subject of much debate. Coal-fired power plants are significant sources of carbon dioxide emissions, a principal greenhouse gas. The related Kyoto Protocol was signed by the United States, but it has since been rejected by the president, who instead has asked for an 18% voluntary decrease in carbon intensity. In response to the administrations request, six electric power sector trade associations, including the Edison Electric Institute, of which Ameren is a member, and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the DOE in December 2004 calling for a 3% - 5% decrease in carbon intensity from the utility sector between 2002 and 2012 on a voluntary basis. Currently, Ameren is considering various initiatives to comply with the MOU. These include enhanced generation at our nuclear and hydro power plants, increased efficiency measures at our coal-fired units, and investing in renewable energy and carbon sequestration projects.
We are unable to predict the ultimate effect of any new environmental regulations, voluntary compliance guidelines, enforcement initiatives ,or legislation on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Any of these factors would add significant pollution control expenditures and operating costs to UEs, Gencos and CILCOs generating assets and, therefore, could also increase financing requirements for some Ameren Companies. Although costs incurred by UE would be eligible for recovery in rates over time, subject to the MoPSC or the ICC approval in a rate proceeding, as applicable, there is no similar mechanism for recovery of costs by Genco or CILCO in Illinois.
UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs participation in the MISO could increase costs, reduce revenues, and reduce UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs control over their transmission assets. Genco could also incur increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of participation in the MISO Day Two Markets.
On May 1, 2004, functional control of the UE and CIPS transmission systems was transferred to the MISO through GridAmerica LLC. On September 30, 2004, IP transferred functional control of its transmission system to the MISO. CILCO had transferred functional control of its transmission system to the MISO before the acquisition. The participation by UE, CIPS and IP in the MISO is expected to increase annual costs by $10 million to $25 million in the aggregate because the companies will be subject to the MISOs administrative costs. This could also result in a decrease in annual revenues of $5 million to $15 million in the aggregate, 14 because of the MISOs method of allocating transmission revenues. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP may also be required to expand their transmission systems according to decisions made by MISO rather than according to their internal planning process. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
In July 2002, the FERC issued its standard market design NOPR. The NOPR proposed three important of changes to the way the current wholesale transmission service and energy markets are operated: the placement of all jurisdictional transmission facilities under the control of an independent transmission provider (similar to the MISO); a new transmission service tariff that would provide a single form of transmission service for all users of the transmission system, including bundled retail load; and a new transmission management system. This new design would use market-based pricing to compensate market participants for power, as well as for transmission congestion and losses. The current system requires generators to make advance reservations for transmission service.
In April2003, the FERC issued a white paper reflecting comments received in response to the NOPR. The white paper indicated that the FERC will not assert jurisdiction over the transmission rate component of bundled retail service. The FERC will ensure in its final rule that existing bundled retail customers retain their existing transmission rights and their rights for future load growth in its final rule. Moreover, the white paper acknowledged that the final rule will provide the states with input on resource adequacy requirements, allocation of firm transmission rights, and transmission planning. The FERC also requested input on the flexibility and timing of the final rules implementation. We believe that the proposed NOPR could have a negative impact on the cost and reliability of service to retail customers. It could lead to trapped transmission costs that might not be recoverable from ratepayers as a result of inconsistent regulatory policies.
Although issuance of the final rule is uncertain and its implementation schedule unknown, the MISO is implementing a separate market design similar to the market design proposed by the NOPR. This new market design is referred to as the MISO Day Two Market. The MISO Day Two Market, scheduled to begin operation on April 1, 2005, is designed to result in improved transparency of power pricing and efficiency in generation dispatch. Since this is a new and complex market, there could be significant initial price volatility. Ultimately, price transparency and dispatch efficiency could result in lower prices on market-based power sales by UE, Genco, AERG and CILCO to their customers. In addition, the movement of power could result in unanticipated transmission congestion charges or credits. MISO has allocated FTRs to UE, CIPS, Genco, and CILCO. FTRs are financial instruments that are intended to hedge this risk, but UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP may not have been allocated the appropriate number of these FTRs. In addition, these instruments could prove ineffective in hedging risk.
Until we achieve some degree of operational experience participating in the MISO, including the MISO Day Two Market, we are unable to predict the impact that the MISO participation or ongoing RTO developments at the FERC or other regulatory authorities will have on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
The market-based rate authority currently held by UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO, AERG, Development Company, Marketing Company, and Medina Valley could be revoked or restricted as a result of the FERCs new market power analysis screen order.
In an order issued in April 2004, the FERC replaced the Supply Margin Assessment Screen previously used to review applications by sellers of electricity at wholesale for authorization to sell power at market-based rates. The new screen uses two measures of market power: (1) a pivotal supplier analysis, and (2) a market share analysis, which is to be prepared on a seasonal basis. Applicants located in a RTO with sufficient market structure and a single energy market were permitted to base their calculations of market power on the size of the market in the geographic region under the control of the RTO, but other applicants were required to base their calculations of market power on the size of the market in the control area where they operate. If the applicant passes both screens, a rebuttable presumption will exist that it lacks generation market power. If the applicant fails either screen, a rebuttable presumption will exist that it has market power. Under such circumstances, the applicant may either seek to rebut the presumption by preparing a delivered price test (identifying the amount of economic capacity from neighboring areas that can be delivered to the control area) or propose mitigation measures. Unless some other mitigation measure is adopted, the applicants authority to sell power at market-based rates in areas where it has market power will be revoked, and the applicant will be required to sell at cost-based rates in those areas.
UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO, AERG, Development Company, Marketing Company, and Medina Valley are currently authorized by the FERC to continue to sell power at market-based rates. However, the FERC indicated in its April 2004 order that it would apply the new market analysis screens to pending and future market-based rate applications, including three-year market-based rate reviews. All of the aforementioned Ameren entities currently have three-year market-based rate reviews pending at the FERC.
As required, these Ameren companies filed an updated market power analysis with the FERC in December 2004. All of the Ameren companies pass both screen measures for the market consisting of the entire MISO footprint. Also in their December filings, these Ameren companies offered to supplement their filings with information that applies the new 15 tests to smaller markets consisting of the control areas in which the Ameren companies sell power, if the MISO Day Two Markets does not begin on March 1, 2005, as originally scheduled. In January 2005, the Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility Commission (MJMEUC) filed a protest to the Ameren companies December filing. In February 2005, the Ameren companies filed a response to the MJMEUCs protest, which rebutted its claims that the Ameren companies possess market power.
We are unable to anticipate how or when the FERC will respond to our December filings and to any supplemental filings that we might make.
Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans, and other employee- related benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
We have defined benefit and postretirement plans that cover substantially all of our employees. Assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates, and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our earnings and funding requirements. Assuming that we continue to receive federal interest rate relief beyond 2005, we do not expect contributions to our defined benefit plans to be required until 2008 and 2009, when an aggregate $400 million is expected to be paid. This amount is an estimate; it may change because of actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates, or any pertinent changes in government regulations, any of which could also result in a requirement to record an additional minimum pension liability.
In addition to the costs of our retirement plans, the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans, and other employee benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
UEs, Gencos, CILCOs, AERGs, Medina Valleys and EEIs electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses, and increased purchased power costs.
UE, Genco, CILCO, AERG, Medina Valley, and EEI own and operate coal, nuclear, gas-fired, hydro, and oil-fired generating facilities. Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are:  increased       prices for fuel and fuel transportation as existing contracts       expire;  facility       shutdowns due to a failure of equipment or processes or operator       error;  longer-than-anticipated       maintenance outages;  disruptions       in the delivery of fuel and lack of adequate   inventories;  labor       disputes;  inability       to comply with regulatory or permit requirements;  disruptions       in the delivery of electricity;  increased       capital expenditures requirements, including those due to environmental       regulation; and  unusual       or adverse weather conditions, including catastrophic events such as       fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting electric       generating facilities.
A substantial portion of Gencos and CILCOs generating capacity is committed under affiliate contracts that expire at the end of 2006. Upon expiration of these contracts, Gencos and CILCOs electric generating facilities must compete for the sale of energy and capacity, which exposes them to price risk.
Genco and CILCO, through AERG, own 4,751 megawatts and 1,165 megawatts, respectively, of non-rate-regulated electric generating facilities. Of these non-rate-regulated electric generating facilities, approximately 3,300 megawatts are currently under full-requirements contracts with our affiliates. The remainder of the generating capacity must compete for the sale of energy and capacity.
To the extent electric capacity generated by these facilities is not under contract to be sold, the revenues and results of operations of these non-rate-regulated subsidiaries will generally depend on the prices that they can obtain for energy and capacity in Illinois and adjacent markets. Among the factors that could influence such prices (all of which are beyond our control to a significant degree) are:  the       current and future market prices for natural gas, fuel oil, and       coal;  current       and forward prices for the sale of electricity;  the       extent of additional supplies of electric energy from current competitors       or new market entrants;  the       pace of deregulation in our market area and the expansion of deregulated       markets;  the       regulatory and pricing structures developed for Midwest energy markets as       they continue to evolve and the pace of development of regional markets       for energy and capacity outside of bilateral contracts;  future       pricing for, and availability of, transmission services on transmission       systems, and the effect of RTOs and export energy transmission       constraints, which could limit the ability to sell energy in markets       adjacent to Illinois; 16  the       rate of growth in electricity usage as a result of population changes,       regional economic conditions, and the implementation of conservation       programs; and  climate       conditions prevailing in the Midwest market.
In a report issued by the ICC in late 2004, a process was outlined that would have CIPS, CILCO and IP procuring power through an auction monitored by the ICC after the current Illinois rate freeze and supply contracts end in 2006. Genco and AERG would probably participate in this auction, but there might be a limit on the maximum amount of power they could supply to Amerens Illinois utilities. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
Genco and UE have signed an agreement to dispatch their generating facilities jointly, which produces benefits and efficiencies for both generating parties. Pending or future federal and state regulatory proceedings and policies may evolve in ways that could affect Gencos ability to participate in these affiliate transactions on current terms. For example, as a result of the MoPSC order approving the transfer of UEs Illinois-based utility business to CIPS, certain terms of the joint dispatch agreement were ordered to be modified; this could result in margins from interchange sales of $7 million to $24 million being transferred from Genco to UE. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a more detailed description of these modifications. The termination of the joint dispatch agreement, or modifications to it, could have a material adverse effect on UE or Genco.
UEs ownership and operation of a nuclear generating facility creates business, financial, and waste disposal risks.
UE owns the Callaway nuclear plant, which represents approximately 14% of UEs generation capacity. Therefore, UE is subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:  potential       harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the       operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of       radioactive materials;  limitations       on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover       losses that might arise in connection with UEs nuclear operations or       those of others in the United States;  uncertainties       with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts if insurance coverage       is inadequate;  increased       public and governmental concerns over the adequacy of security at nuclear       power plants;  uncertainties       with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning       nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives (UEs facility operating       license for the Callaway nuclear plant expires in 2024); and  costly       and extended outages for scheduled or unscheduled     maintenance.
The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as UEs. In addition, although UE has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at its plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm UEs results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.
Operating performance at UEs Callaway nuclear plant has resulted in unscheduled or extended outages including the extension of Callaways scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in 2004. In addition, Ameren and UE incurred significant unanticipated replacement power and maintenance costs. As a result, the operating performance at UEs Callaway nuclear plant has declined in comparison with both its past operating performance and the operating performance of other nuclear plants in the U.S. Ameren and UE are actively working to address the factors that led to the decline in Callaways operating performance. They are reviewing management and supervision of operating personnel, equipment reliability, maintenance worker practices, engineering performance, and overall organizational effectiveness. However, Ameren and UE cannot predict whether such efforts will result in an overall improvement of operations at Callaway. Any actions taken are expected to result in incremental operating costs at Callaway. Further, additional unscheduled or extended outages at Callaway could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of Ameren and UE.
Our energy risk management strategies may not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities or increased volatility in our earnings.
We are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity, and emission credits. Prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity, and emission credits may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose us to commodity price risk. We use long-term purchase and sales contracts in addition to derivatives such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options, and swaps to manage these risks. We attempt to manage our risk associated with these activities through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management procedures. We cannot assure you that these strategies will be successful in managing our pricing 17 risk, or that they will not result in net liabilities to us as a result of future volatility in these markets.
Although we routinely enter into contracts to hedge our exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices, we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, our ability to hedge our exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies, which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
Our counterparties may not meet their obligations to us.
We are exposed to risk that counterparties who owe us money, energy or other commodities or services will not be able to perform their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements (which include agreements for a subsidiary of Dynegy and others to supply electricity to IP during 2005 and 2006) fail to perform, IP might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at then-current market prices. In such event, we might incur losses in addition to the amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties.
Our facilities are considered critical infrastructure and may be targets for acts of terrorism.
Like other electric and gas utilities, our power generation plants, fuel storage facilities, and transmission and distribution facilities may be targets of terrorist activities that could result in disruption of our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products. Any such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant additional costs to repair, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
Our businesses are dependent on our ability to access the capital markets successfully. We may not have access to sufficient capital in the amounts and at the times needed.
We use short-term and long-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity and funding for capital requirements, including those related to future environmental compliance, not satisfied by our operating cash flows. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively impact our ability to maintain and expand our businesses. Based on our current credit ratings, we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets that could increase our cost of capital or impair our ability to access the capital markets.

19 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
For information on our principal properties, including planned additions, replacements and transfers, see the generating facilities table below and Liquidity and Capital Resources and Regulatory Matters in Manage-ments Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report. See also Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
Ameren is a member of MAIN, a regional electric reliability council organized to coordinate the planning and operation of bulk power supply in Illinois and portions of Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri. The Ameren membership covers UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. Ameren has provided formal written notice to the MAIN board of directors of its intent to withdraw from MAIN effective January 1, 2006, provided the configuration of MAIN remains the same. Ameren intends to join another RRO prior to its withdrawal from MAIN. Ameren may cancel its notice of intent to withdraw from MAIN at any time. Until the withdrawal is effective, Ameren will continue to honor all of its obligations as a member of MAIN. Before Ameren acquired it, IP gave notice to MAIN of its intent to withdraw effective December 31, 2004. However, as a result of Amerens acquisition of it, IP remains a member of MAIN through the Ameren membership.
The bulk power system of UE, CIPS and Genco is operated as an Ameren-wide control area and transmission system under the FERC-approved joint dispatch agreement. The joint dispatch agreement provides a way for UE and Genco to participate in the coordinated operation of CIPS and UEs transmission facilities. Thisallows UE and Genco to achieve economies consistent with the provision of reliable electric service and an equitable sharing of the benefits and costs of that coordinated operation. See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of changes to the joint dispatch agreement that may arise out of a February 2005 MoPSC order. In 2004, we had a minimum of 18 direct connections with other control areas for the exchange of electric energy, directly and through the facilities of others. CILCO continues to operate as a separate control area, so CILCOs generating plants, including those of its subsidiary, AERG, have not been jointly dispatched with the generating plants owned by UE and Genco. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are transmission-owning members of the MISO, and they have transferred functional control of their systems to the MISO. Transmission service on the UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP transmission systems are provided pursuant to the terms of the MISO OATT on file with the FERC. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
OVERVIEW Ameren Executive Summary Overview The most significant event for Ameren in 2004 was the announcement, financing and September 30th completion of the $2.3 billion acquisition of IP and an additional 20% ownership interest in EEI.
In 2004, Ameren recorded solid net earnings of $2.84 per share due to weather-adjusted demand growth, the incremental earnings contribution resulting from the acquisitions of IP on September 30, 2004, and CILCORP Inc. on January 31, 2003, and increased earnings from our excess power sales. This earnings performance was accomplished despite very mild summer weather, a planned refueling and maintenance outage at our Callaway nuclear plant and the early issuance of common shares to fund the IP acquisition. Earnings in 2003 included unusual gains of 30 cents per share related to the adoption of an accounting standard and settlement of a dispute with a coal supplier, and there was no Callaway outage required in 2003.
Earnings Total revenues in 2004 increased 12% to $5.2 billion from 2003. Growth in revenues was generated by the acquisitions of IP and CILCORP, which added $484 million in revenues in 2004. In addition, revenues benefited from weather-adjusted growth, increased excess power sales due to greater availability of low-cost generation and improved power prices, and higher natural gas delivery rates.
During 2004, factors that mitigated this improvement in revenues included extremely mild summer weather and the final $30 million annual rate reduction under the electric rate case settlement in Missouri that went into effect on April 1, 2004. Summer weather in 2004 in our service territory was the seventh mildest of the past 109 years, according to the National Weather service. Mild 2004 weather reduced revenues by an estimated $38 million in 2004, relative to 2003.
Operations and maintenance expenses increased 9% to $1.3 billion in 2004 from 2003, again, primarily because of the acquisitions. Expenses were also higher because of the two-month refueling and maintenance outage at our Callaway nuclear plant, which increased expenses by $39 million, and purchased power costs by $24 million. A 70-day to 75-day outage is scheduled for 2005 in order to replace major equipment that is expected to increase the generating capacity of the Callaway plant by over 50 megawatts and improve future safety and reliability. Employee benefit costs also increased in 2004 as compared with 2003.
Operations expenses benefited from the $18 million refund of exit fees paid to the MISO upon re-entry to that system in 2004 and lower labor costs.
Liquidity Cash flows from operations of $1.1 billion in 2004 at Ameren, along with other funds, were used to pay dividends to common shareholders of $479 million and fund capital expenditures of $806 million. Cash flows from operations were reduced by a $295 million contribution to our pension plan.
Ameren issued approximately 30 million shares of common stock in 2004 to finance the acquisition of Illinois Power and an additional 20% interest in EEI. Net proceeds of $1.3 billion were used to pay the cash portion of the purchase price of $443 million, and reduce high-cost debt and pay related fees at IP. Other financing activities primarily related to refinancing higher cost or maturing debt in Amerens other subsidiaries.
30 Outlook We expect continued economic growth in our service territory to benefit electric demand in 2005 with natural gas and coal prices supporting power prices similar to 2004 levels. Amerens coal and related transportation costs rose in 2004 and are expected to rise 3% to 4% in 2005 and 2006. These costs are expected to increase more beyond 2006 as existing contracts are replaced. We also expect to realize synergies from the IP acquisition in 2005 and 2006.
Electric rates for Amerens operating subsidiaries have been fixed or declining for periods ranging from 12 years to 22 years. In addition, power supplied by Amerens non-rate-regulated generation subsidiaries has been subject to contracts to supply our Illinois distribution subsidiaries. In 2006, electric rate adjustment moratoriums and intercompany power supply contracts expire in Amerens regulatory jurisdictions. We believe that the prices reflected in these power supply contracts are below current market prices. In 2005, we will begin the process of preparing and filing utility cost-of-service studies and filing a proposed framework for power procurement that will determine electric rates in 2006 and beyond.
The EPA has proposed more stringent emission limits on all coal-fired power plants. Between 2005 and 2015, Ameren expects its subsidiaries will be required to spend between $1.4 and $1.9 billion to retrofit its power plants with pollution control equipment. Approximately two-thirds of this investment will be in the Companys regulated Missouri operations and therefore is expected to be recoverable over time from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts invested in non-rate-regulated operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust for this increased investment by the industry.
General Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company registered with the SEC under the PUHCA. Amerens primary asset is the common stock of its subsidiaries. Amerens subsidiaries operate rate-regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses, rate-regulated natural gas distribution businesses and non-rate-regulated electric generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois as discussed below. Dividends on Amerens common stock are dependent on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries.See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed description of our principal subsidiaries.
UE       operates a rate-regulated electric generation, transmission and       distribution business, and a rate-regulated natural gas distribution       business in Missouri and Illinois.
CIPS       operates a rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and       distribution business in Illinois.
Genco       operates a non-rate-regulated electric generation business.
CILCO       is a subsidiary of CILCORP (a holding company) and operates a       rate-regulated electric transmission and distribution business, a       primarily non-rate-regulated electric generation business, through its       subsidiary, AERG, and a rate-regulated natural gas distribution business       in Illinois.
IP       operates a rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and       distribution business in Illinois. See Note 2 - Acquisitions to our       financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further       information.
The financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its majority-owned subsidiaries. As the acquisition of IP occurred on September 30, 2004, Amerens Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows for the periods prior to September 30, 2004, and Amerens Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003, do not reflect IPs results of operations or financial position. Financial information of CILCORP and CILCO reflected in Amerens consolidated financial statements include the period from January 31, 2003, when these companies were acquired. See Note 2 - Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information on the accounting for the IP and CILCORP acquisitions. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, unless otherwise indicated.
In addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total, certain information is expressed in cents per share. These amounts reflect factors that directly affect Amerens earnings. We believe this per share information is useful because it enables readers to understand the impact of these factors on Amerens earnings per share. All references in this report to earnings per share are based on average diluted common shares outstanding during the applicable year.
IP Acquisition On September 30, 2004, Ameren completed the acquisition from Dynegy of all the common stock and 662,924 shares of preferred stock of IP (based in Decatur, Illinois) and an additional 20% ownership interest in EEI and its subsidiaries. Ameren acquired IP to complement its existing Illinois electric and gas operations. The purchase included IPs rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business serving approximately 600,000 electric and 415,000 gas customers in areas contiguous to our existing Illinois utility service territories. With the acquisition, IP became an Ameren subsidiary operating as AmerenIP.
For a discussion of the regulatory agency approvals granted in connection with this acquisition, see Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
31 The total transaction value was $2.3 billion. It included the assumption of $1.8 billion of IP debt and preferred stock and consideration, including transaction costs, of $443 million cash, net of $51 million cash acquired. In February 2005, Ameren received $5 million from Dynegy as a final working capital settlement. Ameren placed $100 million of the cash portion of the purchase price in a six-year escrow account, pending resolution of certain contingent environmental obligations of IP and other Dynegy affiliates for which Ameren has been provided indemnification by Dynegy. See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on the IP environmental matter to which the indemnification and escrow applies. In addition, this transaction included a fixed-price power supply agreement for IPs annual purchase in 2005 and 2006 of 2,800 megawatts of electricity from DYPM. The contract was marked to fair value at closing of the IP acquisition. This agreement is expected to supply about 70% of IPs electric customer requirements during those two years. The remaining 30% of its power needs in 2005 and 2006 will be supplied under other arrangements. In the event that any of IPs suppliers are unable to supply the electricity required by existing agreements, IP would be forced to find alternative suppliers to meet its load requirements, thus exposing IP to market price risk, which could have a material impact on Amerens and IPs results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
Amerens financing plan for funding this acquisition included the issuance of new Ameren common stock. Ameren issued an aggregate of approximately 30 million common shares in February 2004 and July 2004, which generated net proceeds of about $1.3 billion. Proceeds from these issuances were used to finance the cash portion of the purchase price and to reduce high-cost IP debt assumed as part of this transaction and to pay related premiums. See Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on redemptions and repurchases of certain IP indebtedness after the acquisition.
Ameren expects the acquisition of IP to be accretive to earnings in the first two years of ownership. That belief is based on a variety of assumptions related to power prices, interest rates, and synergies, among other things. In December 2004, 230 IP employees accepted a voluntary separation opportunity, which provides an enhanced separation benefit and extended medical and dental benefits. Employees who accepted the voluntary separation opportunity will leave IP throughout 2005 as business needs warrant. These voluntary separations are consistent with Amerens plan for the integration of IP and conditions in the ICC order approving the acquisition, which relate to the realization of administrative synergies from the acquisition. Estimated separation costs of $26 million have been deferred as a regulatory asset of future recovery from customers, which is also consistent with the ICC order.
For income tax purposes, Ameren and Dynegy have elected to treat Amerens acquisition of IP stock as an asset acquisition under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings Summary Our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors. Weather, economic conditions, and the actions of key customers or competitors can significantly affect the demand for our services. Our results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations caused by winter heating and summer cooling demand. With approximately 85% of Amerens revenues directly subject to regulation by various state and federal agencies, decisions by regulators can have a material impact on the price we charge for our services. Our non-rate-regulated sales are subject to market conditions for power. We principally use coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas, and oil in our operations. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to the world economic and political environment, weather, supply and demand levels and many other factors. We do not have fuel or purchased power cost recovery mechanisms in Missouri or Illinois for our electric utility businesses, but we do have gas cost recovery mechanisms in each state for our gas delivery businesses. The electric and gas rates for UE in Missouri are set through June 2006, and are set for CIPS, CILCO and IP in Illinois through the end of 2006, so that cost decreases or increases will not be immediately reflected in rates. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our cost of borrowing and pension and postretirement benefits. We employ various risk management strategies in order to try to reduce our exposure to commodity risks and other risks inherent in our business. The reliability of our power plants and transmission and distribution systems and the level of purchased power costs, operating and administrative costs, and capital investment are key factors that we seek to control in order to optimize our results of operations , financial position, and liquidity.
Amerens net income for 2004, 2003, and 2002, was $530 million ($2.84 per share), $524 million ($3.25 per share), and $382 million ($2.60 per share), respectively. In 2003, Amerens net income included an after-tax gain of $31 million (19 cents per share) related to the settlement of a dispute over mine reclamation issues with a coal supplier and a net cumulative effect after-tax gain of $18 million (11 cents per share) associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. The coal contract settlement gain recaptured coal costs, plus accrued interest, previously paid to a coal supplier for future reclamation of a coal mine that principally supplied a UE power plant. The SFAS No. 143 net gain resulted principally from the elimination from accumulated deprecation of accrued costs of removal for non-rate-regulated assets; these accrued costs of removal were not legal obligations.
32 The following table presents net cumulative effect after-tax gains (losses) recorded upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 in 2003: Net       Cumulative Effect After-Tax Gain (Loss) Ameren (a) $ 18 Genco 18 CILCORP (b)(c) 4 CILCO 24 IP (c) (2 ) (a) Excludes amounts for IP and CILCORP as SFAS No. 143 was adopted prior to the acquisitions by Ameren.
(b) CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances.
(c) Represents predecessor information.
In 2002, Amerens net income included after-tax restructuring charges of $58 million (40 cents per share) for a voluntary employee retirement program; the retirement of some facilities at UEs Venice, Illinois power plant; and the temporary suspension of operation of two coal-fired generating units at Gencos Meredosia, Illinois power plant. See Note 7 - Restructuring Charges and Other Special Items to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information.
The following table presents a reconciliation of Amerens net income to net income, excluding restructuring charges and otherspecial items discussed above, as well as the effect of SFAS No. 143 adoption, all net of taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Ameren believes that this reconciliation presents results from continuing operations on a more comparable basis. However, net income, or earnings per share, excluding these items is not a presentation defined under GAAP, and it may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP presentation included in Amerens financial statements.

143       adoption - diluted $ 2.84 $ 2.95 $ 3.00 Excluding the gains on the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the settlement of the coal mine reclamation dispute in the prior year, Amerens net income increased $55 million, and earnings per share decreased 11 cents, in 2004 as compared with 2003. The change in net income was primarily due to organic growth in revenues; increased margins on interchange sales, primarily due to greater availability of low-cost generation (16 cents per share); gas delivery rate increases (10 cents per share); lower labor costs (8 cents per share); the MISO refund of previously paid exit fees upon UEs and CIPS re-entry into the MISO in the second quarter of 2004 (6 cents per share); and results of CILCORPs inclusion for an additional month and IPs inclusion for three months in 2004. Partially offsetting these increases to income were increased fuel and purchased power costs and other operations and maintenance costs as a result of UEs Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in the second quarter of 2004 (22 cents per share), extremely mild 2004 weather conditions (estimated at 12 to 16 cents per share), electric rate reductions (13 cents per share), and higher employee benefit costs (11 cents per share). Increased common shares outstanding also reduced Amerens earnings per share in 2004 as compared with 2003.
Excluding the gains related to the coal mine reclamation settlement and an accounting change in 2003 and the restructuring loss in 2002, Amerens net income in 2003 increased $35 million, and earnings per share decreased 5 cents as compared to 2002. The change in net income was primarily due to the acquisition of CILCORP; favorable margins on interchange sales (35 cents per share), due to improved power prices in the energy markets and greater low-cost generation available for sale ; organic growth; lower labor costs due to the voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early 2003 (11 cents per share); lower maintenance expenses in Amerens pre-CILCORP acquisition operations (25 cents per share); and a decrease in Other Miscellaneous Expense as a result of the expensing of economic development and energy assistance programs in the second quarter of 2002 related to the UE Missouri electric rate case settlement. These benefits to Amerens 2003 net income were partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions (estimated at 40 to 50 cents per share), primarily due to cooler summer weather in Amerens pre-CILCORP territory than the normal conditions experienced in 2002; an electric rate reduction in UEs Missouri service territory that went into effect in April 2003 (11 cents per share); lower sales of emission credits (7 cents per share); and higher employee benefit costs (8 cents per share). Increased common shares outstanding 33 also reduced Amerens earnings per share in 2003 as compared with 2002.
As a holding company, Amerens net income and cash flows are primarily generated by its principal subsidiaries: UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP. The following table presents the contribution by Amerens principal subsidiaries to Amerens consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 Net       income: UE (a) $ 373 $ 441 $ 336 CIPS 29 26 23 Genco (a) 107 75 32 CILCORP (b) 10 14 - IP (c) 27 - - Other (d) (16 ) (32 ) (9 Ameren       net income $ 530 $ 524 $ 382 (a) Includes       earnings from unregulated interchange power sales that provided in 2004,       $75 million of UEs net income (2003 - $58 million; 2002 - $20 million)       and $39 million of Gencos net income (2003 - $30 million; 2002 - $10       million).
(b) Excludes       net income prior to the acquisition date of January 31, 2003. CILCORP       consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its       balances.
(c) Excludes       net income prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004.
(d) Includes       corporate general and administrative expenses, transition costs associated       with the CILCORP and IP acquisitions and other non-rate-regulated       operations.
Acquisition Accounting The amortization of noncash purchase accounting fair value adjustments at IP increased Amerens and IPs net income by $26 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004, as compared with the prior-year period. The amortization of the fair value adjustments at IP that increased net income were related to pension and postretirement liabilities, long-term debt, a power supply contract with EEI that expires in 2005, and a power supply contract with Dynegy for 2,800 megawatts that expired in 2004. Partially offsetting these items was the amortization of the fair value adjustment related to a power supply contract for 700 megawatts that also expired in 2004. Concurrent with its acquisition of IP, Ameren negotiated a contract with Dynegy to supply IP 2,800 megawatts for 2005 and 2006. The fair value adjustments associated with this agreement and the EEI contract noted above will be amortized over the terms of the contracts and will have a net favorable impact on IPs net income. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) impact on IPs net income related to the amortization of purchase accounting fair value adjustments during the three months ended December 31, 2004: 2004 Statement       of Income line item: Other       operations and maintenance (a) $ 7 Interest (b) 10 Fuel       and purchased power (c) 26 Income       taxes (d) (17 ) Impact       on net income $ 26 (a) Related       to the adjustment to fair value of the pension plan and postretirement       plans.
(b) Related       to the adjustment to fair value of all the IP debt assumed at acquisition       on September 30, 2004. The net write-up to fair value of all the IP debt       assumed, excluding early redemption premiums, is being amortized over the       anticipated remaining life of the debt. See Note 6 - Long-term Debt and       Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of       this report for additional information.
(c) Related       to the amortization of fair value adjustments to power supply contracts.
(d) Tax       effect of the above amortization adjustments.
The amortization of noncash purchase accounting fair value adjustments at EEI decreased Amerens net income. The amortization of fair value adjustments at EEI related to the additional 20% interest acquired by Ameren on September 30, 2004, for plant in service, emission credits and a power supply agreement with IP that expires in 2005. The amortization of the fair value adjustment of the power supply agreement of $3 million in 2004 between IP and EEI had no affect on net income at a consolidated Ameren level because IP is amortizing its fair value adjustment for the same power supply agreement. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) impact on net income related to the amortization of purchase accounting fair value adjustments of EEI during the three months ended December 31, 2004: 2004 Statement       of Income line item: Fuel       and purchased power (a) $ (4 ) Depreciation (b) (1 ) Income       taxes (c) 2 Impact       on net income $ (3 ) (a) Related       to the amortization of emission credits and a power supply contract.
(b) Includes       the amortization of the fair value adjustment related to plant assets.
(c) Tax       effect of the above amortization adjustments.
The amortization of noncash purchase accounting fair value adjustments at CILCORP increased Amerens and CILCORPs net income in 2004 by $6 million compared with $24 million for the 11 months in the prior year. The amortization of the fair value adjustments that increased net income were related to pension and postretirement liabilities, coal contract liabilities, and long-term debt. The amortization of fair value adjustments that decreased net income were related to electric plant in service, purchased power, and emission credits. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) impact on Amerens and CILCORPs net income related to the amortization of purchase accounting fair value 34 adjustments during 2004 and the 11 months ended December 31, 2003: 2004 2003 Statement       of Income line item: Other       operations and maintenance (a) $ 13 $ 39 Interest (b) 8 7 Fuel       and purchased power (c) (6 ) 1 Depreciation       and amortization (d) (5 ) (7 ) Income       taxes (e) (4 ) (16 ) Impact       on net income $ 6 $ 24 (a) Related       to the adjustment to fair value of the pension plan and postretirement       plans; retail customer contracts and investment assets.
(b) Related       to CILCORPs 9.375% senior notes due 2029 and 8.70% senior notes due 2009       being written up to fair value and amortized over the average remaining       life of the debt. See Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings to our       financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional       information.
(c) Related       to emission credits and coal contracts.
(d) Related       to plant assets at Duck Creek, E.D. Edwards, and Sterling Avenue being       amortized over the remaining useful lives of the plants.
(e) Tax       effect of the above amortization adjustments.
The total purchase accounting adjustments for IP, EEI and CILCORP had a net favorable impact on Amerens net income of $29 million for the year 2004.
Electric Operations The following tables present the favorable (unfavorable) variations in electric margins, defined as electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs, from prior year for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. We consider electric and interchange margins useful measures to analyze the change in profitability of our electric operations between periods. We have included the analysis below as a complement to our financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, electric and interchange margins may not be a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP information we are providing elsewhere in this report.
The variation for Ameren shows the contribution from IP for the last three months of 2004 and the contribution from CILCORP for January 2004 as separate line items, which allows an easier comparison with other margin components. The variation in IP electric margins in 2004 include the purchase accounting adjustments discussed above; they are compared with the full years 2003 and 2002, when Ameren did not own IP and it did not contribute to Amerens electric margins. The variations in CILCORP and CILCO electric margins in 2004 and 2003 are compared with the full years 2003 and 2002. Before January 31, 2003, Ameren did not own CILCORP and CILCO and they did not contribute to Amerens electric margins.

Ameren 2004 versus 2003 Amerens electric margin increased $128 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in the current year, electric margin increased $4 million for 2004. Strong organic growth due to improved economic conditions and increased margins on interchange sales more than offset the effect of unfavorable weather conditions, increased fuel and purchased power costs due to the second quarter 2004 Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage, and rate reductions in the current year as compared with the prior year. In addition, revenues from emission credit sales decreased $7 million in 2004 as compared with 2003.
According to the National Weather Service, summer weather in 2004 in Amerens service territory was the seventh mildest in the past 109 years. Cooling degree-days during that period in our service territory were down approximately 20% from both normal conditions and the prior year. Warmer winter weather in 2004 also resulted in heating degree-days that were down approximately 7% in 2004 in our service territory as compared with 2003, and down approximately 10% from normal conditions. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP sales and three months of IP sales in the current year, residential sales were flat compared to the prior year, as organic growth offset the impact of the unfavorable weather conditions. Commercial and industrial sales increased 2% in 2004 due to improved economic conditions.
Rate reductions resulting from the 2002 UE electric rate case settlement in Missouri negatively affected electric revenues during 2004. Annual reductions of $50 million, $30 million, and $30 million were effective April 1, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively.
Margins on interchange sales increased $37 million in 2004 as compared with the same period in 2003, because of increased availability of low-cost generation resulting from record power generation and reduced demand from native load customers due to the mild summer weather. In addition to increased availability of low-cost power, the current year also benefited because both higher natural gas and coal prices contributed to increased power prices. Average realized power prices on interchange sales increased to approximately $34 per megawatthour in 2004 from approximately $32 per megawatthour in 2003. In 2004, Amerens base load coal-fired electric generating plants average capacity factor was approximately 76%, despite the extremely mild weather, as compared with 73% in 2003, and the equivalent availability factor was approximately 87%, as compared with 85% in the prior-year period.
EEIs revenues decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 because of reduced emission credit sales and decreased sales to the DOE, which also resulted in a decrease in purchased power. EEIs sales of emission credits were $2 million in 2004 as compared with $10 million in 2003.
Amerens fuel and purchased power costs increased $54 million, excluding the additional month of CILCORP and the additional three months of IP in the current year, as compared with 2003, because of increased power purchases necessitated by the Callaway refueling and maintenance outage as well as increased fossil generation and fuel prices.
2003 versus 2002 Amerens electric margin increased $187 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. Increases in electric margin in 2003 were attributable primarily to the acquisition of CILCORP, increased margins on interchanges sales, and organic sales growth, partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions relative to 2002, lower sales of emission credits, and rate reductions. CILCORPs contribution to Amerens electric margin for the 11 months ended December 31, 2003, was $236 million. Margins on interchange sales increased $92 million in 2003 because of improved power prices in the energy markets and increased low-cost generation availability. Average realized power prices on interchange sales increased to approximately $32 per megawatthour in 2003 from approximately $25 per megawatthour in 2002. Availability of coal-fired generating plants increased to 85% in 2003 from 82% in 2002 because there were fewer scheduled and 36 unscheduled outages. In addition, there was no refueling outage at our Callaway nuclear plant in 2003.
The unfavorable weather conditions were the cooler summer weather in 2003 versus warmer than normal conditions in the same periods in 2002. Cooling degree-days were down approximately 25% in 2003 in our service territory compared with 2002 and down approximately 10% from normal conditions. Heating degree-days in 2003 were comparable to 2002 and normal conditions. In Amerens pre-CILCORP acquisition service territory, weather-sensitive residential and commercial electric kilowatthour sales declined 4% and 2%, respectively, in 2003 compared with 2002. Industrial electric kilowatthour sales increased 2% in 2003 in Amerens pre-CILCORP acquisition service territory because of improving economic conditions.
Annual rate reductions of $50 million and $30 million were effective April 1, 2002 and 2003, respectively, as a result of the 2002 UE electric rate case settlement in Missouri. Those reductions negatively affected electric revenues in 2003 and 2002.
EEIs revenues decreased in 2003 as compared with 2002 because of lower emission credit sales and decreased sales to the DOE, which also resulted in a decrease in fuel and purchased power. EEIs sales of emission credits were $10 million in 2003 as compared with $38 million in 2002.
Amerens fuel and purchased power increased in 2003 compared with 2002 because of increased kilowatthour sales, related primarily to the addition of CILCORP. Excluding CILCORP, fuel and purchased power decreased in 2003 primarily because of the greater availability of low-cost generation.
UE UEs electric margin decreased $15 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. Residential sales were comparable with prior-year sales as the effect of mild summer weather was offset by organic growth. Rate reductions from the 2002 rate case settlement negatively affected electric revenues during 2004. Partially offsetting these decreases to electric revenues were increased interchange margins and higher emission sales. Margins on interchange sales increased $23 million in 2004 as compared to 2003, because of increased availability of low-cost generation and higher power prices. Revenues from emission credit sales decreased $3 million in the current year as compared with 2003. Fuel and purchased power increased $20 million in 2004, primarily because of increased purchased power of $24 million resulting from the Callaway refueling and maintenance outage during the second quarter of 2004, partially offset by decreased demand due to mild summer weather conditions in 2004.
UEs electric margin decreased $22 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. Decreases in electric margin in 2003 were primarily attributable to the unfavorable weather conditions and the rate reductions resulting from the 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement mentioned above. However, margins on interchange sales increased $64 million because of improved power prices in the energy markets and increased low-cost generation availability. Fuel and purchased power decreased slightly in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of lower transmission costs.
CIPS CIPS 2004 electric margin was comparable with the margin in 2003. Electric margin was favorably affected by an industrial customers switching from CIPS to Marketing Company and the elimination of the negative margin associated with this customer. Unfavorable weather conditions offset the above increases to margin.
CIPS electric margin decreased $27 million in 2003, as compared with 2002, primarily because of the unfavorable weather conditions and several customers switching from CIPS to Marketing Company. Commencing in 2002, all of CIPS, CILCOs, IPs and UEs Illinois residential, commercial and industrial customers had a choice in electric suppliers according to the Illinois Customer Choice Law. CIPS continues to provide electric delivery service to these customers, and it charges them ICC-approved delivery service tariff rates for that service. Customer switching resulted in a $95 million decline in CIPS revenues which is included in the line item growth and other in the table above, offset by a related decrease of $85 million in purchased power for 2003.
Genco Gencos electric margin increased $61 million in 2004, as compared with 2003. The increase in electric margin was primarily attributable to an increase in wholesale and retail margins due to sales to new customers and increased availability of lower-cost generation. Interchange margins increased $14 million in 2004, as compared with 2003 because power prices were higher and more low-cost power was available for saledue tothe mild weather.
Gencos electric margin increased $43 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. Increases in electric margin in 2003 were primarily attributable to increased margins on interchange sales. Interchange margins on interchange sales increased $33 million in 2003 because of improved power prices in the energy markets. Fuel and purchased power increased $2 million in 2003 because of higher purchased power costs associated with higher energy prices and lower generation availability. These increased costs were partially offset by lower generation costs due to a 12% decline in megawatthour generation. The decline in generation during 2003 was primarily attributable to the timing of outages at Gencos power plants and unexpected downtime and unfavorable margins associated with Gencos CTs.
37 CILCORP and CILCO Electric margin decreased $14 million at CILCORP and $7 million at CILCO in 2004 as compared with 2003. Decreases in electric margin were primarily attributable to reduced revenues due to two large CILCO industrial customers switching to Marketing Company in July and October 2003 and transfers of other non-rate-regulated customers to Marketing Company ($168 million). Fuel and purchased power also decreased because several customers switched to Marketing Company.
CILCORPs electric margin decreased $13 million and CILCOs electric margin decreased $14 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. Decreases in electric margin in 2003 were primarily attributable to lower margin per megawatthour sold on a non-rate-regulated basis to electric customers outside CILCOs service territory, the switch of the two large CILCO customers to Marketing Company discussed above, and unfavorable weather conditions. In addition, fuel and purchased power at CILCORP increased as compared with CILCO, because of the net effect of purchase accounting fair value adjustments related to emission allowances, partially offset by those associated with coal contracts.
IP IPs electric margin increased $16 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. The increase in electric margin was principally due to lower purchased power costs as a result of purchase accounting adjustments ($26 million). Revenues were reduced because of unfavorable summer weather. Electric margin was also unfavorably affected by industrial customers who chose alternative suppliers.
The decrease in electric margin of $47 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 reflected lower residential and commercial sales volume due to cooler summer weather, the full-year impact of the 5% residential rate decrease that was effective May 1, 2002; and lower industrial sales due to the combined effect of customers who chose alternative suppliers and general economic conditions. Electricity purchases increased in 2003 as compared with 2002. A higher average cost per unit was offset by lower purchased volumes due to the cooler weather and economic conditions. Decreased interchange revenues in 2003 resulted from the favorable reversal of previously recorded litigation reserves with an interchange customer in 2002.
Gas Operations The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) variations in gas margins, defined as gas revenues less gas purchased for resale, as compared with the prior periods for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. We consider gas margin to be a useful measure to analyze the change in profitability of our gas utility operations between periods. We have included the table below as a complement to our financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, gas margin may not be a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP information we are providing elsewhere in this report.

(c) Includes       predecessor information for periods prior to September 30, 2004.
Gas margins at Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO increased in 2004 primarily because of delivery rate increases, partially offset by milder winter weather conditions. Amerens gas margin also increased $13 million because of the additional month of CILCORP results and $40 million because of the three months of IP results in 2004. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP and the three months of IP in 2004, Amerens sales were down 5% as a result of the mild winter weather conditions. IPs gas margin decreased $4 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of milder winter weather in 2004.
Amerens gas margin increased in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of $73 million added by the acquisition of CILCORP. The gas margins at UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 were comparable to 2002 as heating degree-days were consistent with 2002. Gas margin at IP was higher in 2003 as compared with 2002 because of colder weather in the first quarter of 2003 in IPs service territory.
Operating Expenses and Other Statement of Income Items Other Operations and Maintenance Ameren Amerens other operations and maintenance expenses increased $113 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. The additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in the current year accounted for $15 million and $43 million, respectively, of other operations and maintenance expense in 2004 as compared with 2003. Additionally, expenses at Ameren increased $55 million in 2004, primarily because of increased maintenance expenses stemming from 38 the refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant during the second quarter of 2004. The outage lasted 64 days and resulted in incremental maintenance costs of $39 million. Refueling and maintenance outages occur approximately every 18 months. They typically include the replacement of fuel and the performance of maintenance and inspections. The previous refueling and maintenance outage occurred in the fall of 2002. In addition to the Callaway nuclear plant outage expenses, employee benefit costs were $43 million higher, primarily because of increased pension and postretirement medical costs. The adoption in the second quarter of 2004, retroactive to January 1, 2004, of FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, resulted in the recognition of nontaxable federal subsidies expected to be provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act (the Medicare Prescription Drug Subsidy), which partially offset the employee benefit cost increases noted above ($11 million).
See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11 - Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. Expenses at Ameren, UE and CIPS were reduced in 2004 by $18 million, $13 million, and $5 million, respectively, from the refund to UE and CIPS of previously paid exit fees upon their re-entry into the MISO. Lower labor costs ($21 million) in 2004 also partially offset the above increases to other operations and maintenance expenses.
Amerens other operations and maintenance expenses increased $64 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily due to the $135 million added by the acquisition of CILCORP, transition costs related to the CILCORP acquisition, higher employee benefit costs ($17 million), and a net increase in injuries and damages costs based on claims experience ($6 million). These increases in other operations and maintenance expenses were partially offset by lower labor costs resulting primarily from the voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early 2003 and lower plant maintenance costs because of the number and timing of outages ($60 million). There was no refueling outage at the Callaway nuclear plant in 2003.
UE Other operations and maintenance expenses at UE increased $38 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of increased power plant maintenance expenses as a result of the refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant discussed above ($39 million). In addition to the Callaway outage expenses, employee benefit costs were increased by $8 million. These were primarily increased pension costs, partially offset by reduced postretirement costs due to the adoption of FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 106-2, noted above. In addition, the refund of exit fees upon UEs re-entry into the MISO as discussed above ($13 million) also partially offset the increased costs.
UEs other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $49 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of lower labor costs related to the voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early 2003 and lower plant maintenance costs ($34 million), partially offset by the higher employee benefit costs ($10 million) and an increase in injuries and damages costs ($3 million).
CIPS CIPS other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $8 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of CIPS portion of the MISO exit fee refund ($5 million) as discussed above and lower labor costs, partially offset by increased employee benefit costs ($2 million).
CIPS other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $5 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of lower labor costs related to the voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early 2003, and a decrease in environmental remediation costs ($3 million), partially offset by an increase in injuries and damages costs of $8 million.
Genco Other operations and maintenance expenses at Genco decreased $6 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of a reduction in power plant maintenance ($10 million) as a result of fewer outages and lower labor costs, partially offset by increased employee benefit costs ($5 million).
Gencos other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $21 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of a reduction in consulting costs at its coal-fired generation plants, a decrease in commitment fees for the use of UEs and CIPS electric transmission lines ($5 million), and a net decrease in injuries and damages costs ($3 million).
CILCORP and CILCO CILCORPs other operations and maintenance expenses increased by $41 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of higher employee benefit costs ($12 million), and additional injuries and damages costs ($4 million). Pursuant to an arrangement entered into between Ameren and AES in conjunction with the acquisition of CILCORP, AES indemnified CILCORP and CILCO for the $13 million after-tax cost of the $21 million settlement of a litigation claim by Enron Power Marketing Inc. As a result,other operations and maintenance expenses includes the net 39 cost of $8 million while income taxes reflect a tax benefit of $8 million, resulting in no net income statement effect. See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information on the Enron Power Marketing, Inc. litigation claim .
CILCOs other operations and maintenance expenses increased $33 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of the litigation settlement, discussed above, additional injuries and damage costs ($4 million), increased maintenance ($3 million), increased technology expenses ($3 million), and higher overhead allocations. Partially offsetting these increases to other operations and maintenance expenses at CILCORP and CILCO were reduced labor costs in 2004.
CILCORPs other operations and maintenance expenses in 2003 were comparable to 2002. CILCOs other operations and maintenance expenses increased $19 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs ($19 million) and higher bad debt expense ($5 million), substantially offset by reduced environmental costs ($9 million) for remediation of elevated boron levels at the Duck Creek power plant recycle pond in 2002.
IP IPs other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $19 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from the reimbursement of the MISO exit fee and RTO development costs ($9 million), as well as reduced labor costs and other operating efficiencies ($12 million), partially offset by higher employee benefit costs ($8 million) and costs associated with injuries and damages reserves.
The increase in other operations and maintenance expenses at IP of $12 million for 2003 over 2002 was primarily due to higher employee benefit costs ($11 million) and insurance claims and an increase in legal reserves ($16 million), partially offset by operating efficiencies and reduced technology expenditures ($14 million).
Voluntary Retirement and Other Restructuring Charges and Coal Contract Settlement See Note 7 - Restructuring Charges and Other Special Items to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
Depreciation and Amortization 2004 versus 2003 Amerens, UEs and IPs depreciation and amortization expenses increased $38 million, $10 million and $2 million, respectively, in 2004 as compared with 2003, because of capital additions. Depreciation and amortization expenses at Ameren also increased in 2004 because of the inclusion of the additional month of CILCORP expenses of $6 million and three months of IP expenses of $21 million. Amortization of regulatory assets at IP decreased $9 million in 2004 from 2003 as the transition cost regulatory asset was written off in purchase accounting in conjunction with Amerens acquisition of IP.
Depreciation and amortization expenses at CIPS and Genco in 2004 were comparable to 2003.
Depreciation and amortization expenses at CILCORP and CILCO decreased $9 million and $6 million, respectively, in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because reduced expenses as a result of property retirements at the end of 2003 exceeded the increased expense from new capital additions in 2004. CILCORP depreciation was also favorably affected by reduced purchase accounting amortization adjustments.
2003 versus 2002 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $88 million and $6 million at Ameren and Genco, respectively, in 2003 as compared with 2002. The increase at Ameren was primarily due to the inclusion of $72 million of CILCORP expense in 2003. In addition, depreciation and amortization expenses increased at Ameren and Genco because of new capital additions.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $3 million at UE in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of capital additions, partially offset by a decrease of $5 million resulting from a reduction in depreciation rates. The reduction in depreciation rates of $5 million in 2003 was based on the updated analysis of asset values, service lives, and accumulated depreciation levels that was required by UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $6 million at CILCORP in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the book value of the Duck Creek and E.D. Edwards power plants and the Sterling Avenue peaking station ($7 million).
Depreciation and amortization expenses at CIPS, CILCO and IP in 2003 were comparable to 2002. Amortization of regulatory assets at IP decreased $32 million in 2003 from 2002 primarily due to reduced amortization of the transition cost regulatory asset. In 2002, IPs increased financial performance allowed for additional recognition of amortization as compared with 2003.
40 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 2004 versus 2003 Taxes other than income taxes increased $13 million at Ameren in 2004 as compared with 2003. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP ($6 million) and the three months of IP $15 million included in the current year, taxes other than income taxes decreased $8 million. The decrease was primarily due to decreased gross receipts taxes, partially offset by increased property taxes.
UEs taxes other than income taxes increased $9 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because property taxes were higher in 2004.
Taxes other than income taxes at CIPS, Genco and IP in 2004 were comparable to 2003.
Taxes other than income taxes decreased at CILCORP and CILCO by $13 million and $14 million, respectively, in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because gross receipts taxes were down as a result of customers switching to Marketing Company.
2003 versus 2002 At Ameren, taxes other than income taxes increased $37 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because the acquisition of CILCORP added $34 million.
At UE, taxes other than income taxes decreased $5 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, because of a decrease in gross receipts taxes ($2 million) related to lower native load customer sales in milder weather and a decrease in real estate taxes resulting from lower assessments in 2003.
Taxes other than income taxes at IP increased $10 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because 2002 expenses benefited from a favorable audit conclusion on gross receipts taxes of $4 million.
At Genco, taxes other than income taxes increased $9 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of adjustments related to property tax assessments and increased property taxes associated with the four CTs added in the third and fourth quarters of 2002.
CIPS, CILCORPs and CILCOs taxes other than income taxes in 2003 were comparable to 2002.
Other Income and Deductions 2004 versus 2003 Amerens other income and deductions increased $18 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of increased interest income ($8 million) from the temporary investment of proceeds from Amerens February and July 2004 equity offerings and increased allowance for funds used during construction ($6 million). The additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in the current year had a minimal impact on other income and deductions.
Total other income at IP decreased $35 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because interest income was reduced after the elimination of IPs Note Receivable from Former Affiliate in conjunction with Amerens acquisition of IP. See Note 2 - Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the note elimination. O ther income and deductions includes interest income of $128 million for 2004 as compared with $170 million in 2003 under IPs Note Receivable from Former Affiliate.
Other income and deductions at UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO were comparable in 2004 to 2003. See Note 8 - Other Income and Deductions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information .
2003 versus 2002 Amerens and UEs net other income increased $34 million and $20 million, respectively, in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of the expensing of economic development and energy assistance programs required by the UE Missouri electric rate case settlement in 2002 ($26 million). Amerens other income also increased in 2003 because of a decrease in the minority interest related to EEIs lower earnings in 2003. The increase in UEs other income was partially offset by a net decrease in earnings from UEs ownership interest in EEI and decreased gains on derivative contracts.
CIPS other income decreased in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of a decline in intercompany interest income ($3 million) CIPS received on the Genco subordinated promissory note due to a lower outstanding principal balance. In addition, CIPS other income decreased in 2003 as compared with 2002, because of a decrease in contributions in aid of construction ($2 million).
Gencos, CILCORPs and CILCOs other income and deductions in 2003 were comparable to 2002.
IPs total other income increased $5 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, due to a gain recognized in 2003 related to an asset retirement obligation, along with reduced losses on disposal of property and a general reduction in nonoperating expenses.
41 Interest 2004 versus 2003 Interest expense for Ameren in 2004 was comparable to 2003. However, excluding the additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in the current year, interest expense decreased at Ameren by $20 million. The decrease was primarily due to the redemption of $150 million of Ameren floating rate notes at the end of 2003 and reduced short-term borrowings, as well as redemptions of long-term debt during 2004 and 2003 at its subsidiaries, as noted below.
Gencos interest expense was reduced $7 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily due to a reduction in principal amounts outstanding on intercompany promissory notes to CIPS and Ameren along with decreased borrowings from Amerens non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool. The balance of intercompany notes payable to CIPS and Ameren was $283 million at December 31, 2004, as compared to $411 million at December 31, 2003, and $462 million at December 31, 2002.
Interest expense decreased $1 million at CILCO in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of the redemption of long-term debt of $119 million in 2004 and $100 million in 2003, partially offset by increased intercompany borrowings.
Interest expense was flat at CILCORP in 2004 as compared to 2003. Redemptions of debt at CILCO, noted above, and repurchases of an aggregate of $40 million of CILCORP debt in 2004 and 2003, respectively, were offset by increased intercompany borrowings.
Interest expense decreased $32 million at IP in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to redemptions and repurchases of indebtedness of $700 million in 2004 and $190 million in 2003, reductions in the notes payable to IP SPT, and purchase accounting amortization. See Note 5 - Short-term Borrowings and Liquidity and Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information.
Interest expense at UE and CIPS in 2004 was comparable to 2003.
2003 versus 2002 Interest expense increased $63 million at Ameren in 2003 as compared to 2002, primarily because the assumption of CILCORP debt added $48 million to interest expense. In addition, interest expense was higher in 2003 because Genco issued $275 million of 7.95% senior notes in June 2002 ($10 million).
Interest expense decreased $7 million at CIPS in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of the maturity or redemption of first mortgage bonds in the third quarter of 2002 ($2 million) and in the second quarter of 2003 ($5 million).
Interest expense increased $15 million at Genco in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of increased borrowings from Amerens non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool ($9 million), partially offset by a reduction in the principal amounts outstanding on subordinated intercompany promissory notes to CIPS and Ameren in May 2003 ($4 million). In addition, Gencos interest expense increased in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because $275 million of 7.95% senior notes were issued in June 2002.
Interest expense decreased $12 million at CILCORP and $5 million at CILCO in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of the redemption of long-term debt, partially offset by expenses associated with debt redemption. In addition, CILCORP interest expense decreased $7 million from the amortization ofpurchase accounting adjustments that recorded CILCORP's debt at fair value.
Interest expense increased $51 million at IP in 2003 primarily because of the additional issuances of $150 million and $400 million 11.50% mortgage bonds in 2003 and 2002, respectively, partially offset by the reduction in IP SPT transitional funding trust notes, the redemption of IPs $100 million and $90 million mortgage bonds in August and September 2003, respectively, and the repayment of IPs $300 million term loan ($200 million repaid in December 2002 and $100 million repaid in May 2003).
UEs interest expense in 2003 was comparable to 2002.
Income Taxes 2004 versus 2003 Income tax expense was lower at Ameren in 2004 as compared with 2003, because of a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was lower primarily because of the recording in 2004 of the expected nontaxable federal Medicare Prescription Drug Subsidy and a tax benefit related to CILCOs settlement of a litigation claim.
Income tax expense increased at CIPS in 2004 as compared to 2003, primarily due to higher pretax income in 2004 and an Illinois tax settlement in the third quarter of 2003, which resulted in reduced income taxes in the prior-year period. Income tax expense increased at Genco and IP in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of higher pretax income in 2004. Income tax expense decreased at UE primarily because of lower pretax income in 2004. The recording of the nontaxable federal Medicare Prescription Drug subsidy lowered taxable income at all the Ameren companies. Income tax expense decreased at CILCORP and CILCO primarily because of a tax benefit of $8 million as a result of CILCOs settlement of a litigation claim and lower 42 pretax income in 2004. See also Note 13 - Income Taxes to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding effective tax rates.
2003 versus 2002 Income tax expense increased at Ameren, UE and Genco in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of higher pretax income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate at Ameren. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to an Illinois tax settlement ($7 million) at CIPS in the third quarter of 2003. Income tax expense decreased at CILCO and IP primarily because of lower pretax income. CILCORPs income tax expense in 2003 was comparable to 2002.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The tariff-based gross margins of Amerens rate-regulated utility operating companies (UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP) continue to be the principal source of cash from operating activities for Ameren and its rate-regulated subsidiaries. A diversified retail customer mix of primarily rate-regulated residential, commercial and industrial classes and a commodity mix of gas and electric service provide a reasonably predictable source of cash flows. For cash flow, Genco principally relies on sales to an affiliate under a contract expiring at the end of 2006 and sales to other wholesale and industrial customers under long-term contracts. In addition, we plan to use short-term borrowings to support normal operations and other temporary capital requirements.
The following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Net       Cash Provided By Operating       Activities Net       Cash Provided By (Used       In) Investing Activities Net       Cash Provided By (Used       In) Financing Activities 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Ameren (a) $ 1,129 $ 1,022 $ 827 $ (1,266 ) $ (1,181 ) $ (803 ) $ 95 $ (358 ) $ 537 UE 749 633 692 (580 ) (503 ) (454 ) (136 ) (124 ) (244 ) CIPS 73 57 95 78 12 (7 ) (165 ) (70 ) (97 ) Genco 180 211 108 (50 ) (58 ) (442 ) (131 ) (154 ) 335 CILCORP (b) 136 70 88 (120 ) (95 ) (120 ) (20 ) 4 46 CILCO 137 103 109 (125 ) (86 ) (123 ) (18 ) (31 ) 24 IP (c) 247 128 218 (272 ) (126 ) (141 ) 13 (102 ) (1 ) (a) Excludes       amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004;       excludes amounts for CILCORP prior to the acquisition date of January 31,       2003; and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant       subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.
(b) Includes       predecessor information for periods prior to January 2003. CILCORP       consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its       balances.
(c) 2004       amounts include financial information prior to the acquisition date of       September 30, 2004; all amounts prior to September 30, 2004, represent       predecessor information.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities 2004 versus 2003 Cash flows provided by operating activities increased for Ameren in 2004 as compared with the same period in 2003. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to incremental earnings from the acquisition of IP in the fourth quarter of 2004, lower cash taxes paid with the pension contribution, IP debt redemption premiums, and accelerated tax depreciation. Ameren and UE also received $36 million in 2004 as compared with $15 million in 2003, as a result of UEs settlement in 2003 of a dispute over mine reclamation issues with a coal supplier, which benefited cash flows from operating activities.
Cash flows from operating activities from all the Ameren Companies, except IP, were negatively affected in 2004 by a $295 million pension contribution made by Ameren (UE - $186 million; CIPS - $33 million; Genco - $29 million; CILCORP and CILCO - $41 million).
Cash flows provided by operating activities increased for CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of the increased earnings discussed under Results of Operations and less cash taxes paid. CILCORP and CILCO also benefited from net income tax refunds of $40 million and $20 million, respectively. IPs cash flows from operations benefited from the 2004 recovery of prepayments related to IP natural gas purchase contracts made in 2003. These benefits in 2004 were partially offset at UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, and CILCO by the pension contribution. IPs cash flows from operations were negatively affected by the timing of IPs income tax reimbursements to Dynegy and the effect of the acquisition on tax payments to Dynegy. Deferred taxes at IP in 2004 benefited from debt redemption premiums and accelerated tax depreciation resulting from the acquisition.
Gencos cash flows provided by operating activities decreased in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of the timing differences associated with income taxes and the increased pension contributions, partially offset by increased earnings.
43 2003 versus 2002 Cash flows provided by operating activities increased for Ameren and Genco and decreased for UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 as compared with 2002. The increase in c ash flows provided by operating activities for Ameren and Genco was primarily a result of the increased net earnings discussed above under Results of Operations. Amerens increase in earnings in 2003 as compared with the same period in 2002 was partially attributable to 11 months of CILCORPs earnings in 2003 associated with the acquisition. Gencos cash flows from operating activities also increased with the receipt of a $76 million tax refund. The increase at Ameren was reduced by two noncash components of net earnings. One was associated with the gain of $18 million related to the adoption of SFAS No. 143. The other was the $51 million pretax gain related to UEs settlement of the coal mine reclamation issues, of which only $15 million was received in cash during 2003.
Partially offsetting these benefits to cash flows from operating activities were increased materials and supplies inventories resulting from higher natural gas volumes put into storage and higher natural gas prices.
Cash provided by operating activities decreased for UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 as compared with 2002 primarily because of increased working capital requirements and timing differences. UEs decrease in cash flows from operating activities was attributable to increased tax payments and natural gas inventory increases, partially offset by lower operations and maintenance expenses and UEs settlement of the coal mine reclamation issues, of which $15 million was received in cash during 2003. CIPS decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to increased tax payments in 2003 as compared with 2002.
IPs cash flows provided by operating activities decreased in 2003 as compared with 2002 because of the increased earnings discussed above in Results of Operations and because of changes in working capital primarily related to timing differences in cash flows. Cash flows were positively affected in 2003 by the receipt of one additional month of interest income on IPs Note Receivable from Former Affiliate. See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the Note Receivable from Affiliate. IPs decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was partially offset by higher priced natural gas inventories and higher prepayments due to increased collateral requirements on natural gas purchases.
Pension Funding The Ameren Companies, excluding IP, and EEI made cash contributions totaling $295 million in 2004 and $27 million in 2003 to Amerens defined benefit retirement plan qualified trust. The cash contributions in 2004 and 2003 to Amerens defined benefit retirement plan qualified trusts will, among other things, provide cost savings because they will allow us to avoid paying a portion of the insurance premiums to the Pension Guarantee Trust Corporation and will mitigate future benefit cost increases. Based on our assumptions at December 31, 2004, we expect to be required under ERISA to fund an aggregate of $400 million for the period of 2005 to 2009 in order to maintain minimum funding levels for our pension plan; no minimum contribution will be required until 2008, assuming continuation of the current federal interest rate relief beyond 2005. We expect UEs, CIPS, Gencos, CILCOs and IPs portion of the future funding requirements to be approximately 50%, 9%, 9%, 11% and 21%, respectively. These amounts are estimates and may change with actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates, any pertinent changes in government regulations, and any prior voluntary contributions. See Note 11 - Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities 2004 versus 2003 Cash flows used in investing activities increased for Ameren, UE, CILCORP and CILCO and decreased for Genco i n 2004 as compared with 2003. Included in Amerens cash flows used in investing activities was $443 million of net cash paid for the acquisition of IP and Dynegys 20% interest in EEI in 2004 and $479 million of net cash paid for the acquisition of CILCORP and Medina Valley in 2003. Excluding the cash paid for acquisitions in 2004 and 2003, Amerens cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of increased capital expenditures, discussed below, at UE, CILCORP, and CILCO, and the addition of IPs capital expenditures after the acquisition date.
CIPS cash flows provided by investing activities increased in 2004 as compared with 2003 principally because of increased cash receipts related to the intercompany note receivable from Genco. The note receivable from Genco was issued in conjunction with the transfer of CIPS generating assets and liabilities to Genco in 2000. See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion of the note receivable. CIPS cash flows provided by investing activities also increased due to decreased capital expenditures incurred in 2004 as compared with 2003.
Gencos cash flows used in investing activities decreased, principally because capital expenditures were lower in 2004 than in 2003.
IPs cash flows used in investing activities increased principally because of contributions made to the money pool in 2004.
44 2003 versus 2002 Cash flows used in investing activities increased for Ameren and UE and decreased for CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 as compared with 2002.
Amerens increase in cash used in investing activities in 2003 as compared with 2002 was primarily related to $479 million in net cash paid for the acquisitions of CILCORP and Medina Valley in early 2003 and capital expenditures for CILCORP in 2003. These increased investing activities in 2003 were partially offset by lower construction expenditures at other Ameren subsidiaries and lower nuclear fuel expenditures in 2003. The increase for UE in 2003 over the prior-year period was primarily related to the 2002 receipt of $84 million UE had invested in the utility money pool, partially offset by lower construction and nuclear fuel expenditures in 2003.
The decrease in 2003 cash flows used in investing activities from the prior-year period for Genco was primarily related to lower construction expenditures as Genco completed construction of CTs in 2002. In addition, Genco paid $140 million in the first quarter of 2002 to Development Company for a CT purchased, but not yet paid for, at December 31, 2001. The decrease for CILCORP and CILCO was primarily due to lower construction expenditures related to the completed installation of pollution-control equipment at their coal-fired power plants.
The increase in cash provided by investing activities for CIPS was primarily due to principal payments received on its intercompany note receivable from Genco.
Capital Expenditures The following table presents the capital expenditures by the Ameren Companies for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002: Capital Expenditures 2004 2003 2002 Ameren (a) $ 806 $ 682 $ 787 UE 524 480 520 CIPS 46 50 57 Genco 50 58 442 CILCORP (b) 125 87 124 CILCO 125 87 124 IP (c) 135 126 144 Other (d) 26 23 (232 ) (a) Excludes       amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004;       excludes amounts for CILCORP prior to the acquisition date of January 31,       2003; and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant       subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.
(b) 2002       amounts represent predecessor information. 2003 amounts include January       2003 predecessor information of $16 million. CILCORP consolidates CILCO       and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances.
(c) 2003       and 2002 amounts represent predecessor information. 2004 includes amounts       totaling $100 million incurred prior to the acquisition date of September       30, 2004.
(d) Consists       primarily of capital expenditures by Ameren Services and includes       intercompany transactions betwee n Development       Company and Genco related to Genco's purchase of a CT in 2002.
Amerens capital expenditures for 2004 principally related to various upgrades at UEs power plants, including the replacement of condenser bundles, low-pressure rotor equipment and steam generators, and other upgrades completed during the refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant. The replacement and upgrade work at UEs Callaway plant resulted in capital expenditures of $40 million in 2004. UE also incurred capital expenditures related to the installation of new CTs at its Venice plant and replacement of turbines at its Sioux and Rush Island power plants in 2004. In addition, UEs capital expenditures included environmental and other upgrades at UE power plants and expenditures incurred for new transmission and distribution lines. CILCORPs and CILCOs capital expenditures in 2004 were primarily related to power plant upgrades made at the Edwards and Duck Creek plants in order for CILCOs non-rate-regulated subsidiary, AERG, to have more flexibility in future fuel supply for power generation.
Gencos use of cash in 2004 for capital expenditures was primarily attributed to the replacement of a turbine generator at its Coffeen power plant. Capital expenditures at IP consisted of numerous projects to upgrade and maintain the reliability of IPs electric and gas transmission and distribution systems and to add new customers to the system.
Amerens capital expenditures for 2003 principally related to various upgrades at UEs and Gencos coal-fired power plants, NO x reduction equipment expenditures at CILCOs generating plants, replacements and improvements to the existing electric transmission and distribution system and natural gas distribution system, and construction costs for CTs at UE. In 2002, UE placed into service 240 megawatts of CT capacity (approximately $135 million). In addition, Genco placed into service 470 megawatts of CT capacity (approximately $215 million). Also in 2002, Genco paid approximately $140 million to Development Company for a CT purchased but accrued for in December 2001. In addition, selective catalytic reduction technology was added on two units at one of Gencos coal-fired power plants at a cost of $42 million.
The following table estimates the capital expenditures that will be incurred by the Ameren Companies from 2005 through 2009, including construction expenditures, capitalized interest and allowance for funds used during construction (except for Genco which has no allowance for funds used during construction) and estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental standards: 2005 2006 - 2009 Total UE $ 520 $ 2,460 - $ 3,480 $ 2,980 - $ 4,000 CIPS 55 260 - 300 315 - 355 Genco 60 480 - 590 540 - 650 CILCO       (T&D) 55 180 - 200 235 - 255 CILCO (a) 80 170 - 220 250 - 300 IP 140 485 - 530 625 - 670 Other (b) 20 35 - 50 55 - 70 Total       Ameren $ 930 $ 4,070 - $ 5,370 $ 5,000 - $ 6,300 (a) AERG       capital expenditures related to CILCOs non-rate-regulated generating       business.
(b) Includes       amounts for non-Registrant Ameren subsidiaries.
45 UEs estimated capital expenditures include the replacement of steam generators at UEs Callaway nuclear plant, estimated at $70 million, and transmission, distribution and other generation-related activities, as well as for compliance with new NO x control regulations discussed below. Also included in the estimate is the addition of new CTs with approximately 330 megawatts of capacity at UEs Venice, Illinois power plant site by the end of 2005. Total costs expected to be incurred for these units at the Venice power plant are $125 million.
UE committed to make between $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion of infrastructure investments during the period January 1, 2002, to June 30, 2006, as part of UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement, including the addition of 700 megawatts of generation capacity. The new capacity requirement is expected to be satisfied by the addition of 240 megawatts in 2002 and the proposed transfer from Genco to UE, at net book value (approximately $240 million), of approximately 550 megawatts of CTs at Pinckneyville and Kinmundy, Illinois. As of December 31, 2004, UE had expended $1.5 billion toward the 2002 rate case settlement. In addition, commitments totaling at least $15 million for gas infrastructure improvements between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2006, were agreed upon as part of UEs 2003 Missouri gas rate case settlement See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion of these regulatory proceedings.
CIPS and CILCOs estimated capital expenditures are primarily for transmission and distribution-related activities. Gencos estimated capital expenditures are primarily for upgrades to existing coal and gas-fired generating facilities and other generation-related activities. CILCOs estimate also includes capital expenditures for generation-related activities, as well as for compliance with new NO x control regulations at AERGs generating facilities.
IPs estimated capital expenditures include energy infrastructure improvements of $275 million to $325 million through 2006. This commitment was made to the ICC by Ameren in conjunction with the acquisition of IP. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further explanation of IPs infrastructure commitment.
We continually review our generation port-folio and expected power needs. As a result, we could modify our plan for generation capacity, which could include changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio, the type of generation asset technology that will be employed, and whether capacity may be purchased, among other things. Any changes that we may plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred, which could be material.
Environmental Capital Expenditures Both federal and state laws require significant reductions in SO 2 and NO x emissions that result from burning fossil fuels. The Clean Air Act and NO x Budget Trading Program created marketable commodities called allowances. Each allowance gives the owner the right to emit one ton of SO 2 or NO x . All existing generating facilities have been allocated allowances that are based on past production and the statutory emission reduction goals. If additional allowances are needed for new generating facilities, they can be purchased from facilities that have excess allowances or from allowance banks. Our generating facilities comply with the SO 2 limits through the use and purchase of allowances, the use of low-sulfur fuels, and through the application of pollution control technology. The NO x Budget Trading Program limits emissions of NO x during the ozone season (May through September). The NO x Budget Trading Program applies to all electric generating units in Illinois beginning in 2004; it applies to the eastern third of Missouri, where UEs coal-fired power plants are located, beginning in 2007. Our generating facilities are expected to comply with the NO x limits through the use and purchase of allowances or through the application of pollution control technology, including low NO x burners, over fire air systems, combustion optimization, and selective catalytic reduction systems.
As of December 31, 2004, UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI held 1.6 million, 0.4 million, 0.2 million, and 0.3 million tons, respectively, of SO 2 emission allowances with vintages from 2004 to 2012. Each company possesses additional allowances for use in periods beyond 2012. As of December 31, 2004, UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI Illinois facilities held 290 tons, 22,400 tons, 6,300 tons and 8,600 tons, respectively, of NO X emission allowances with vintages from 2004 to 2007. The Illinois EPA is still determining some NO x emission allowance allocations for this period and 2008. UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI expect to use a substantial portion of the SO 2 and NO x allowances for ongoing operations. Allocations of NO x allowances for Missouri facilities will be made when rules are finalized by Missouri regulators. New environmental regulations, including the Clean Air Interstate Rule as discussed below, the timing of the installation of pollution control equipment, and the level of operations will have a significant impact on the amount of allowances actually required for ongoing operations.
In mid-December 2003, the EPA issued proposed regulations with respect to SO 2 and NO x emissions (the Clean Air Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants .
The new rules, if adopted, will require significant additional reductions in these emissions from UE, Genco and CILCO power plants in phases, beginning in 2010. The rules are currently under a public review and comment period and may change before being issued as final. We do not expect regulations to be finalized until the first half of 2005. The 46 following table presents preliminary estimated capital costs based on current technology for the Ameren systems to comply with the Clean Air Interstate Rule and mercury rules, as proposed.
The timing of estimated capital costs between periods at UE will be influenced by whether excess emission credits are used to comply with the proposed rules, thereby deferring capital investment. Amounts for 2005 and 2006 to 2009 are included in our estimated capital expenditures table above.
2005 2006 - 2009 2010       - 2015 Total Ameren $ 50 $ 510 - $ 1,360 $ 355 - $       1,130 $       1,400 - $       1,900 UE 20 160 - 880 175 - 880 840 - 1,140 Genco 10 250 - 340 140 - 200 400 - 550 CILCO 20 100 - 140 40 - 50 160 - 210 See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of environmental matters.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities 2004 versus 2003 Cash flows from financing activities increased for Ameren in 2004 as compared with 2003 principally because more proceeds were received from the issuance of common stock, short-term debt, and long-term debt; it totaled $2.2 billion in 2004 as compared with $1.1 billion in 2003. Proceeds of $1.3 billion received from the issuance of common stock in February 2004 and July 2004 were used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of IP and Dynegys 20% interest in EEI and to reduce high-cost IP debt assumed as part of the transaction and to pay related premiums. Proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in 2003 and 2002 were principally used by Ameren for the acquisition of CILCORP in January 2003. See Note 2 - Acquisitions and Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. Proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in 2004 were temporarily used to repay a $100 million term loan at CILCO and to repay short-term debt totaling $181 million pending their use for the acquisition and recapitalization of IP. A portion of the short-term debt was also used to temporarily fund UEs maturity of long-term debt totaling $85 million in December 2004.
Amerens increase in cash flows from financing activities was partially offset by increased redemptions, repurchases and maturities of short-term debt, long-term debt, and preferred stock, and by the nuclear fuel lease termination payment totaling $1.5 billion in 2004 as compared with $1.0 billion in 2003. The issuance of additional common shares and long-term debt cost Ameren an incremental $26 million in capital issuance costs in 2004 as compared with 2003. Ameren also paid an additional $69 million in common dividends because more common shares were outstanding in 2004 than in 2003.
UEs cash flows used in financing activities increased in 2004 as compared with 2003. In 2004, cash provided by borrowings from the utility money pool, short-term debt, and long-term debt issuances totaling $631 million were used for the redemption and refinancing of long-term debt. In January 2004, UE made a $67 million payment in order to terminate its nuclear fuel lease arrangement. Also contributing to UEs increase in cash used in financing activities were higher incremental dividend payments made to Ameren in 2004 than in 2003.
CIPS cash flows used in financing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003, principally because of $53 million of repayments to the utility money pool arrangement in 2004, compared with $121 million of borrowings from the money pool arrangement in 2003. Increased dividend payments of $13 million to Ameren in 2004 as compared with 2003 contributed to CIPS increase in cash used in financing activities. Proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt in 2004, along with decreased redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of long-term debt and preferred stock in 2004 as compared with 2003 partially offset CIPS increase in cash used in financing activities in 2004.
Gencos cash flows used in financing activities decreased in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of a capital contribution of $75 million received indirectly from Ameren in 2004. The capital contribution received by Genco in 2004 was used for Gencos prepayment of $75 million of the principal amount outstanding under its intercompany note payable to CIPS. The contribution and cash flows from operations allowed Genco to reduce money pool borrowings in 2004 as compared with 2003. Genco had increased dividend payments in 2004 as compared with 2003.
As of December 31, 2004, Genco had affiliate notes payables of $249 million and $34 million to CIPS and Ameren, respectively, which by their current terms have final payments of principal and interest due on May 1, 2005. The note payable to CIPS was issued in conjunction with the transfer of its electric generating assets and related liabilities to Genco. Genco and CIPS expect to renew or modify the CIPS note to extend the principal maturity, which is expected to include continued amortization of the principal amount. Genco and Ameren are currently evaluating various alternatives with respect to the note payable to Ameren. In the event that the maturities of these notes are not extended or restructured, Genco may need to access other financing sources to meet the maturity obligation to the extent it does nothave cash available from its operating cash flows. Such sources of financing could include borrowings under the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool, or infusion of equity capital, 47 or new direct borrowings from Ameren, all subject to applicable regulatory financing authorizations and provisions in Gencos senior note indenture.
CILCORPs cash flows from financing activities decreased in 2004 as compared with 2003, because of lower borrowings. CILCORPs borrowings from the utility money pool arrangement and direct intercompany borrowings from Ameren totaled $47 million in 2004 as compared with $195 million in 2003. A capital contribution from Ameren of $75 million and increased cash flows from operations allowed CILCORP to reduce borrowings from the utility money pool. Borrowings from the utility money pool in the first quarter of 2004 were the source of funds for the repayment of CILCOs $100 million secured bank term loan facility. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt were used to redeem a portion of CILCOs long-term debt in 2004.
CILCOs cash flows used in financing activities decreased in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of reduced dividend contributions made to CILCORP in 2004 as compared with 2003, and a $75 million capital contribution received indirectly from Ameren in 2004. CILCOs increase in cash flows from financing activities was partially offset by reduced borrowings from the utility money pool arrangement in 2004 as compared with 2003.
Cash flows from financing activities increased modestly for IP in 2004 as compared with 2003. Capital contributions of $871 million received from Ameren in the fourth quarter of 2004 were used to redeem and repurchase long-term debt of $700 million and to pay related premiums of $103 million; that compares with $376 million in redemptions of short-term debt and long-term debt in 2003. In 2003, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and prepaid interest received from an affiliate, which totaled $278 million, were used to redeem short-term and long-term debt.
2003 versus 2002 Cash flows from financing activities decreased for Ameren, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO and increased for UE and CIPS in 2003 as compared with 2002. The decrease in cash flows from financing activities for Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO was primarily due to an increase in redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of long-term debt. The decrease in cash flows from financing activities for Ameren was also due to the termination payment on the UE nuclear fuel lease and the incremental payment of dividends on common stock by Ameren due to increased shares outstanding. In addition, Ameren had decreased proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and common stock, which totaled $1.1 billion in 2003 as compared with $1.6 billion in 2002. Proceeds from the sale of common shares by Ameren in 2003 and 2002 were primarily used to fund the acquisition of CILCORP, which was completed in January 2003. See Note 2 - Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail. Gencos decrease in cash flows from financing activities resulted from decreased borrowings from the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool, as well as no issuances of long-term debt in 2003. The decreases in cash flows from financing activities at CILCORP and CILCO were partially offset by proceeds received from intercompany borrowing arrangements by CILCORP and CILCO in 2003.
Cash flows from financing activities increased at UE in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of additional proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt offset by increased redemptions of debt in 2003 as compared with 2002. Cash flows used in financing activities decreased at CIPS in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of increased proceeds from borrowings from the utility money pool, offset by increased long-term debt payments.
Cash flows from financing activities decreased at IP in 2003 as compared to 2002, principally due to less proceeds received from the issuances of short-term debt and long-term debt totaling $150 million in 2003 as compared with $460 million received in 2002. The proceeds received from these issuances in 2003 and 2002, along with the prepaid interest received from an affiliate totaling $128 million in 2003, and cash flows from operating activities was used to redeem short-term debt and long-term debt totaling $376 million in 2003 as compared with $420 million in 2002. Decreased redemptions of debt partially offset IPs decrease in cash flows from debt issuances in 2003 as compared with 2002.
Short-term Borrowings and Liquidity Short-term borrowings typically consist of commercial paper issuances and drawings under committed bank credit facilities with maturities generally from 1 to 45 days. See Note 5 - Short-term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
The following table presents the various committed bank credit facilities of certain of the Ameren Companies and EEI as of December 31, 2004: Credit       Facility Expiration Amount       Committed Amount       Available Ameren: (a) Multiyear       revolving July       2006 $ 235 $ 89 Multiyear       revolving July       2007 350 350 Multiyear       revolving July       2009 350 350 48 Credit       Facility Expiration Amount       Committed Amount       Available UE: Various       364-day revolving through       July 2005 154 - CIPS: Two       364-day revolving through       July 2005 15 - CILCO: Three       364-day revolving through       August 2005 60 - EEI: Two       bank credit facilities through       June 2005 45 7 Total $ 1,209 $ 796 (a) Ameren       Companies may access these credit facilities through intercompany       borrowing arrangements.
At December 31, 2004, certain of the Ameren Companies had committed bank credit facilities totaling $1,164 million, $789 million of which was available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short-term borrowing authorizations, by UE, CIPS, CILCO, IP and Ameren Services through a utility money pool agreement. At December 31, 2004, UE had $375 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, which reduced the available amounts under these facilities. All of the $789 million was available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short-term borrowing authorizations, by Ameren directly, by CILCORP through direct short-term borrowings from Ameren, and by most of the non-rate-regulated subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Resources Company, Genco, Marketing Company, AFS, AERG and Ameren Energy, through a non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool agreement. Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries to coordinate and provide for certain short-term cash and working capital requirements. Separate money pools are maintained for rate-regulated and non-rate-regulated entities. In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement among Ameren, IP, and Ameren Services enables IP to make short-term borrowings directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the utility money agreement, together with any outstanding external short-term borrowings by IP, may not exceed $500 million pursuant to authorizations from the ICC and the SEC under the PUHCA. Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration of the agreements. See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed explanation of the money pool arrangements and the unilateral borrowing agreement. The committed bank credit facilities are used to support our commercial paper programs under which $375 million was outstanding for Ameren on a consolidated basis at December 31, 2004 ($150 million in 2003). Access to our credit facilities for all Ameren Companies is subject to reduction based on use by affiliates.
The following table summarizes the expiration of amounts available under bank credit facilities that were committed at December 31, 2004: Total       Committed Less       than 1 Year 1       - 3 Years 4       - 5 Years More       than 5 Years Ameren $ 935 $ - $ 585 $ 350 $ - UE 154 154 - - - CIPS 15 15 - - - CILCO 60 60 - - - EEI 45 45 - - - Total $ 1,209 $ 274 $ 585 $ 350 $ - In addition to committed credit facilities, a further source of liquidity for Ameren from time to time is available cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2004, Ameren had $69 million of cash and cash equivalents.
Ameren and UE are authorized by the SEC under PUHCA to have an aggregate of up to of $1.5 billion and $1 billion, respectively, of short-term unsecured debt instruments outstanding at any time. In addition, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO have PUHCA authority to have an aggregate of up to $250 million each of short-term unsecured debt instruments outstanding at any time. Genco is authorized by the FERC to have up to $300 million of short-term debt outstanding at any time.
We rely on access to short-term and long-term capital markets as a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows. Our inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively impact our ability to maintain and grow our businesses. After assessing our current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings (see Credit Ratings below), we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets. Such events might cause our cost of capital to increase or our ability to access the capital markets to be adversely affected.
49 Long-term Debt and Equity The following table presents the issuances of common stock and the issuances, redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long-term debt and preferred stock (including any redemption premiums) for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002 for the Ameren Companies, Medina Valley and EEI. For additional information related to the terms and uses of these issuances and the sources of funds and terms for the redemptions, see Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

51 The following table presents the authorized amounts under Form S-3 shelf registration statements filed and declared effective for certain of the Ameren Companies as of January 31, 2005: Authorized Date Authorized Amount Issued Available Ameren (a) June       2004 $ 2,000 $ 459 $ 1,541 UE (b) September 2003 1,000 689 311 CIPS May       2001 250 150 100 (a) Ameren       issued securities totaling $875 million under the August 2002 shelf       registration statement and $459 million under the September 2003 shelf       registration statement.
(b) UE       issued securities totaling $200 million in 2003, $404 million in 2004 and       $85 million in January 2005.
In March 2004, the SEC declared effective a Form S-3 registration statement filed by Ameren in February 2004, authorizing the offering of 6 million additional shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are, at Amerens option, newly issued shares or treasury shares, or shares purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Ameren is currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Ameren is also currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under certain of its 401(k) plans pursuant to effective SEC Form S-8 registration statements. Under DRPlus and our 401(k) plans, Ameren issued 2.3 million shares of common stock in 2004 valued at $107 million. Under DRPlus and our 401(k) plans, Ameren issued 2.5 million and 2.3 million shares of common stock in 2003 and 2002, respectively, that were valued at $105 million and $93 million for the respective years.
Ameren, UE and CIPS may sell all or a portion of the remaining securities registered under the open registration statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant such a sale. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Indebtedness Provisions and Other Covenants See Note 5 - Short-term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the covenants and provisions contained in certain of the Ameren Companies bank credit facilities. Also see Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of covenants and provisions contained in certain of the Ameren Companies indenture agreements and articles of incorporation.
Dividends Common Dividends Ameren paid common stock dividends to its shareholders totaling $479 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2004, $410 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2003, and $376 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2002. This resulted in a payout rate based on net income of 90%, 78% and 98% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Dividends paid to common shareholders in relation to net cash provided by operating activities for the same periods were 42%, 40% and 44%, respectively.
The amount and timing of dividends payable on Amerens common stock are within the sole discretion of Amerens board of directors. The board of directors has so far not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends. However, the board considers various issues including Amerens historic earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, cash flow and potential cash flow requirements, dividend payout rates at other utilities, return on investments with similar risk characteristics and overall business considerations. On February 11, 2005, Amerens board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 63.5 cents per share payable on March 31, 2005, to shareholders of record on March 9, 2005.
Certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other things, restrict the Ameren Companies payment of dividends. Ameren would experience restrictions on dividend payments if it were to defer contract adjustment payments on its equity security units. UE would experience restrictions on dividend payments if it were to extend or defer interest payments on its subordinated debentures. CIPS has provisions restricting its dividend payments based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. Gencos indenture includes restrictions that prohibit making any dividend payments if debt service coverage ratios are below a defined threshold. CILCORP has restrictions if leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio thresholds are not met or if CILCORPs senior long-term debt does not have specified ratings as described in its indenture. CILCO has restrictions on dividend payments relative to the ratio of its balance of retained earnings to the annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock and amounts to be set aside for any sinking fund retirement of its 5.85% Series preferred stock. At December 31, 2004, none of the conditions described above that would restrict the payment of dividends existed. In its approval of the acquisition of IP by Ameren, the ICC issued an order that provides for the ability of IP to pay dividends on its common stock subject to certain conditions related to credit ratings of IP and Ameren and the elimination of IPs 11.5% mortgage bonds. Given the current credit ratings of IP and the amount of IPs 11.5% mortgage bonds that remain outstanding, IPs payment of dividends on its common stock is restricted to $80 million in 2005 and $160 million cumulatively through 2006. In addition, in accordance with the order issued by the ICC, IP will establish a dividend policy comparable to the dividend policy of Amerens other Illinois utilities and consistent with achieving and maintaining a common equity to total capitalization ratio between 50% and 60%.
52 The following table presents dividends paid by Ameren Corporation and by Amerens subsidiaries to their respective parents and also includes amounts retained by Ameren Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 UE $ 315 $ 288 $ 299 CIPS 75 62 62 Genco 66 36 21 CILCORP (a) 18 27 - IP (b) - (b ) (b ) Ameren       (parent) - (3 ) (7 ) Non-Registrants 5 - 1 Dividends       paid by Ameren $ 479 $ 410 $ 376 (a) Prior       to February 2003, CILCORPs dividends would have been paid to AES. These       amounts are excluded from the total dividends paid to Ameren. CILCO paid       dividends of $10 million, $62 million, and $40 million in 2004, 2003, and       2002, respectively.
(b) Prior       to October 2004, the ICC prohibited IP from paying dividends. If permitted       to be paid, IPs dividends would have been paid directly to Illinova or       indirectly to Dynegy.
Preferred Dividends Certain of the Ameren Companies have issued preferred stock on which they are obliged to make preferred dividend payments. Each company board of directors declares the preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a certain date, stating the date on which it is payable and the amount that will be paid. See Note 10 - Stockholder Rights Plan and Preferred Stock to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail concerning the preferred stock issuances.
Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding Amerens, UEs and IPs capital expenditure commitments, related to UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement, UEs 2003 Missouri gas rate case settlement, and Amerens acquisition of IP. See Note 11 - Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding expected minimum funding levels for our pension plan.

The $1 million annual obligation for these       items is included in the Less than 1 year, 1 - 3       Years, and 4 - 5       Years columns. Amounts for More than 5 Years are not included in the total       amount due to the indefinite periods.
(e) Represents       purchase contracts for coal, gas, nuclear fuel and electric capacity. Also       represents a decommissioning liability at IP.
(f) Routine       short-term purchase order commitments are not included.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2004, none of the Ameren Companies had any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business. None of the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any significant off-balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future.
Credit Ratings The following table presents the principal credit ratings by Moodys, S&P and Fitch as of December 31, 2004: Moodys S&P Fitch Ameren: Issuer/corporate       credit rating A3 A- N/A Unsecured       debt A3 BBB+ A- Commercial       paper P-2 A-2 F2 UE: Secured       debt A1 A- A+ Commercial       paper P-1 A-2 F1 CIPS: Secured       debt A1 A- A Genco: Unsecured       debt A3/Baa2 A- BBB+ CILCORP: Unsecured       debt Baa2 BBB+ BBB+ CILCO: Secured       debt A2 A- A IP: Secured       debt Baa3 A- BBB On July 8, 2004, Moodys confirmed Amerens A3 senior unsecured debt and bank loan ratings along with its A3 issuer rating. Moodys outlook for these ratings is stable.
This rating action concluded Moodys review of Ameren's long-term ratings that was initiated on February 4, 2004, in connection with Ameren's agreement to purchase IP from Dynegy. Ameren's Prime-2 rating for short-term debt, including commercial paper, was not under review, and was affirmed.
On July 30, 2004, S&P affirmed its A- long-term corporate credit ratings on Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO and removed the ratings from CreditWatch with negative implications. The A-2 short-term credit ratings for Ameren and UE were not on CreditWatch. The outlook is negative for the long-term ratings.
On October 1, 2004, S&P raised its corporate credit rating and senior secured debt rating on IP from B to A- as a result of the completed acquisition of IP by Ameren. At the same time, S&P removed the rating from CreditWatch with positive implications and assigned a negative outlook to the rating. Also on this date, Moodys upgraded the senior secured debt rating of IP from Ba3 to Baa3 also as a result of the closing of the acquisition. Moodys has a stable outlook assigned to this rating. These new ratings assigned to IP by S&P and Moodys are investment-grade.
54 Any adverse change in the Ameren Companies credit ratings may reduce access to capital and/or increase the cost of borrowings, resulting in a negative impact on earnings. At December 31, 2004, if the Ameren Companies were to receive a sub-investment-grade rating (less than BBB- or Baa3), Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP could have been required to post collateral for certain trade obligations amounting to $76 million, $27 million, $-, $4 million, $2 million, $2 million, and $25 million, respectively. In addition, the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities can increase or decrease based on credit ratings. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities; and it should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.
OUTLOOK We expect the following industrywide trends and Ameren-specific issues to affect earnings in 2005 and beyond:  Ameren,       CILCORP, CILCO and IP expect to continue to focus on realizing integration       synergies associated with these acquisitions, including lower fuel costs       at CILCORP and CILCO and reduced administrative and operating expenses at       IP.
We       expect continued economic growth in our service territory to benefit       electric demand in 2005.
In       2005, we expect natural gas and coal prices to support power prices       similar to 2004 levels. Power prices in the Midwest affect the amount of       revenues UE, Genco and AERG can generate by marketing any excess power       into the interchange markets. Power prices in the Midwest also influence       the cost of power we purchase in the interchange markets.
Amerens       coal and related transportation costs rose in 2004 and are expected to       rise 3% to 4% in 2005 and again in 2006, and to increase further beyond       2006.
Due       to recent or future regulatory proceedings, there could be changes to the       agreement between UE and Genco to dispatch electric generation jointly.       Any change would likely result in a transfer of electric margins between       Genco and UE and could ultimately affect the pricing of electric transfers       between Genco and UE. Amerens earnings could be affected if and when       electric rates for UE are adjusted by the MoPSC to reflect any such       transfers, amendments to the joint disptach agreementand other       changes in costs of providing electric service. See Note 3 - Rate and       Regulatory Matters and Note 14 - Related Party Transactions to our       financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a more       detailed description of the joint dispatch agreement and potential       impacts.
UE       is currently seeking approval from the MoPSC to add Noranda Aluminum to       its service territory. This customers load requirements represent       approximately 5% of UEs current load. UE is also seeking to transfer its       Illinois service territory to CIPS. Genco and UE are seeking to transfer       550 megawatts of CTs from Genco to UE. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory       Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this       report.
UEs       Callaway nuclear plant will have a refueling and maintenance outage in the       fall of 2005, which is expected to last 70 to 75 days. During this outage,       major capital equipment will be replaced, which means that the outage will       last longer than a typical refueling outage, which usually lasts 30 to 35       days and occurs approximately every 18 months. The delivery of some major       equipment for this outage is dependent on adequate water levels in the       Missouri River. Any delays or damage during shipment could result in       additional costs and deferral of the project. During a refueling outage,       maintenance and purchased power costs increase, so the amount of excess       power available for sale decreases versus non-outage   years.
Over       the next few years, we expect increased expenses for rising employee       benefit costs as well as higher insurance and security costs associated       with additional measures we have taken, or may have to take, at UEs       Callaway nuclear plant and our other operating plants.
We       are currently undertaking cost reduction or control initiatives associated       with the strategic sourcing of purchases and streamlining of       administrative functions. UE, Genco and CILCO are also seeking to raise       the equivalent availability and capacity factors of power plants from our       2004 levels.
Electric       rates for Ameren's operating subsidiaries have been fixed or declining for       periods ranging from 12 years to 22 years. In 2006, electric rate       adjustment moratoriums and intercompany power supply contracts expire in       Ameren's regulatory jurisdictions. Approximately 8 million       megawatthours supplied annually by Genco and 6 million megawatthours       supplied annually by AERG have been subject to contracts to provide CIPS       and CILCO, through AERG, with power. The prices in these power       supply contracts of $34.00 per megawatthour for AERG and $38.50 per       megawatthour for Genco were below estimated market prices for similar       contracts in February 2005. CIPS, CILCO and IP made a filing with       the ICC, in February 2005, outlining, among other things, a proposed       framework for generation procurement after 2006. In 2005, Ameren       will also begin the process of preparing utility cost-of-service studies       for filing in Illinois and Missouri in late 2005 or early 2006 to       determine rates for UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. Based on current       assumptions, Ameren expects the average rates for its Illinois utilities,       in a combined basis, may increase by 10% to 20% in 2007 over present       bundled rate levels, with 50% to 70% of this increase resulting from       higher power costs. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our       financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this   report.
55  The       EPA has proposed more stringent emission limits on all coal-fired power       plants. Between 2005 and 2015, Ameren expects that certain of the Ameren       Companies will be required to invest between $1.4 and $1.9 billion to       retrofit their power plants with pollution control equipment. These       investments will also result in higher ongoing operating expenses.       Approximately two-thirds of this investment will be in Amerens regulated       Missouri operations and therefore is expected to be recoverableover       time from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts expended in       non-rate-regulated operations will depend on the adjustment of market       prices for power as a result of this increased   investment.
The outcome and developments related to the above items could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to enhance our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. These strategies may include acquisitions, divestitures, and opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase Amerens shareholder value. We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed.The execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
REGULATORY MATTERS See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
ACCOUNTING MATTERS Critical Accounting Policies Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. Our application of these policies involves judgments regarding many factors which, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures. In the table below, we have outlined the critical accounting policies that we believe are most difficult, subjective or complex. A future change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial results.
Accounting       Policy Uncertainties       Affecting Application Regulatory       Mechanisms and Cost Recovery All       of the Ameren Companies, except Genco, defer costs as regulatory assets in       accordance with SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types       of Regulation, and make investments that they assume will be collected in       future rates.
Regulatory         environment, external regulatory decisions and requirements Anticipated         future regulatory decisions and their impact Impact         of deregulation, rate freezes, and competition on ratemaking         process and         ability to recover costs Basis       for Judgment We       determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by       state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other       factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. If facts       and circumstances led us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset was       probably no longer capable of being recovered, we would record a charge to       earnings, which could be material.
Environmental       Costs We       accrue for all known environmental contamination where remediation can be       reasonably estimated, but some of our operations have existed for over 100       years and previous contamination may be unknown to us.
Extent         of contamination Responsible         party determination Approved         methods for cleanup Present         and future legislation and governmental regulations and standards Results         of ongoing research and development regarding environmental         impacts Basis       for Judgment We       determine the proper amounts to accrue for known environmental       contamination by using internal and third-party estimates of cleanup costs       in the context of current remediation standards and available technology.
56 Accounting       Policy Uncertainties       Affecting Application Unbilled       Revenue At       the end of each period, we estimate, based on expected usage, the amount       of revenue to record for services that have been provided to customers,       but not billed.
Projecting         customer energy usage Estimating         impacts of weather and other usage-affecting factors for the unbilled         period Estimating         loss of energy during the process of transmission and         delivery Basis       for Judgment We       base our determination of the proper amount of unbilled revenue to accrue       each period on the volume of energy delivered as valued by a model of       billing cycles and historical usage rates and growth by customer class for       our service area, as adjusted for the modeled impact of seasonal and       weather variations based on historical results.
Valuation       of Goodwill, Long-Lived Assets and Asset Retirement       Obligations We       assess the carrying value of our goodwill and long-lived assets to       determine whether they are impaired. We also review for the existence of       asset retirement obligations. If an asset retirement obligation is       identified, we determine the fair value of the obligation and subsequently       reassess and adjust the obligation, as necessary. See Note 1 - Summary of       Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II,       Item 8, of this report.
Management's         identification of impairment indicators Changes         in business, industry, technology, or economic and market         conditions Valuation         assumptions and conclusions Estimated         useful lives of our significant long-lived assets Actions         or assessments by our regulators Identification         of an asset retirement obligation Basis       for Judgment Annually,       or whenever events indicate a valuation may have changed, we use internal       models and third parties to determine fair values. We use various methods       to determine valuations, including earnings before interest, taxes,       depreciation and amortization multiples, and discounted, undiscounted, and       probabilistic discounted cash flow models with multiple scenarios. The       identification of asset retirement obligations is conducted through the       review of legal documents and interviews.
Benefit       Plan Accounting Based       on actuarial calculations, we accrue costs of providing future employee       benefits in accordance with SFAS Nos. 87, 106 and 112, which provide       guidance on benefit plan accounting. See Note 11 - Retirement Benefits to       our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this       report.
Future         rate of return on pension and other plan assets Interest         rates used in valuing benefit obligations Health         care cost trend rates Timing         of employee retirements and mortality assumptions Basis       for Judgment We       use a third-party consultant to assist us in evaluating and recording the       proper amount for future employee benefits. Our ultimate selection of the       discount rate, health care trend rate, and expected rate of return on       pension assets is based on our review of available current, historical and       projected rates, as applicable.
Impact of Future Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES Our rates for retail electric and gas utility service are regulated by the MoPSC and the ICC. Nonretail electric rates are regulated by the FERC. Our Missouri electric and gas rates were set through June 30, 2006, as part of the settlement of our Missouri electric and gas rate cases. Our Illinois electric rates are legislatively fixed through January 1, 2007 .
Even without these moratoriums on rate changes, adjustments to rates are based on a regulatory process that primarily reviews a historical period. As a result, revenue increases will lag changing prices. Inflation affects our operations, earnings, stockholders equity, and financial performance.
The current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost. Under existing regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers. As a result, cash flows designed 57 to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years. The generation portion of our business in the Illinois jurisdiction is principally non-rate-regulated and therefore does not have regulated recovery mechanisms.
In our retail electric utility jurisdictions, there are no provisions for adjusting rates to accommodate changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the cost of purchased power. In our retail gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers through PGA clauses. UE, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO are affected by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent they must purchase natural gas to run CTs. They have structured various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins to minimize the impact to the financial statements. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk - Commodity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A, of this report for further information .
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument, derivative or non-derivative, caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates. The following discussion of our risk-management activities includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We handle market risks in accordance with established policies, which may include entering into various derivative transactions. In the normal course of business, we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks, principally business, legal and operational risks, are not represented in the following discussion.
Our risk-management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets within prudent risk parameters. Our risk-management policies are set by a Risk Management Steering Committee, which comprises senior-level Ameren officers.
Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with:  long-term       and short-term variable-rate debt;  fixed-rate       debt;  commercial       paper; and  auction-rate       long-term debt.
We manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we hold within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates.
The following table presents the estimated increase (decrease) in our annual interest expense and net income if interest rates were to increase by 1% on variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2004: Interest       Expense Net       Income (a) Ameren $ 13 $ (9 ) UE 8 (5 ) CIPS 1 (1 ) Genco 2 (1 ) CILCORP 3 (2 ) CILCO 2 (1 ) IP 4 (2 ) (a) Calculations       are based on an effective tax rate of 35%.
The model does not consider the effects of the reduced level of potential overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, management would probably take actions to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.
Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted. NYMEX-traded futures contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the NYMEX and have nominal credit risk. On all other transactions, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction.
Our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables, executory contracts with market risk exposures, and leverage lease investments. The risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base. At D ecember 31, 2004, no nonaffiliated customer represented greater than 10%, in the aggregate, of our accounts receivable. Our revenues are primarily derived from sales of electricity and natural gas to customers in Missouri and Illinois. UE, Genco and Marketing Company have credit exposure associated with accounts receivables from non-affiliated companies for interchange sales. At December 31, 2004, UEs, Gencos and Marketing Companys combined credit exposure to non-investment-grade counterparties related to interchange sales was $2 million, net of collateral (2003 - $4 million). We establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk-management program that involves daily exposure reporting to senior management, master trading and netting agreements, and credit support, such as letters of credit and parental guarantees. We also analyze each counterpartys financial condition prior to entering into sales, forwards, swaps, futures or option contracts, and we monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged leases. We are currently 58 evaluating our credit exposure associated with the expected implementation of the MISO Day Two on April 1, 2005, but we are unable to predict at this time what impact it will have, if any.
Equity Price Risk Our costs of providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, the rate of increase in health care costs and contributions made to the plans. The market value of our plan assets was affected by declines in the equity market in 2000 through 2002 for the pension and postretirement plans. As a result, at December 31, 2002, we recognized an additional minimum pension liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, which resulted in an after-tax charge to OCI and a reduction in stockholders equity of $102 million. In 2004, an after-tax charge to the minimum pension liability was increased, resulting in OCI of $ 6 million, offsetting the $46 million of OCI in 2003 from a reduction in the minimum pension liability and an increase in stockholders equity. The following table presents the minimum pension liability amounts, after taxes, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003: 2004 2003 Ameren (a) $ 62 $ 56 UE 36 34 CIPS 8 7 Genco 4 4 CILCORP (b) - - CILCO 17 13 IP (c) - 10 (a) Excludes       amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004, and       includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant subsidiaries and       intercompany eliminations.
(b) CILCORP       consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances.
(c) Represents       predecessor information in 2003.
The amount of the pension liability as of December 31, 2004, was the result of asset returns, interest rates, and our contributions to the plans during 2004. In future years, the liability recorded, the costs reflected in net income, or OCI, or cash contributions to the plans could increase materially without a recovery in equity markets in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of 8.5%. If the fair value of the plan assets were to grow and exceed the accumulated benefit obligations in the future, then the recorded liability would be reduced and a corresponding amount of equity would be restored, net of taxes.
UE also maintains trust funds, as required by the NRC and Missouri and Illinois state laws, to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning. As of December 31, 2004, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities (67%), debt securities (29%), and cash and cash equivalents (4%) and totaled $235 million at fair value (2003 - $212 million). By maintaining a portfolio that includes long-term equity investments, UE seeks to maximize the returns to be utilized to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk. However, the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. UE actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trusts to various investment options. UEs exposure to equity price market risk is, in large part, mitigated, due to the fact that UE is currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in its electric rates, which would include unfavorable investment results.
Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, and natural gas to the extent they cannot be recovered through rates. We pursue a philosophy of mitigating financial risks through structured risk-management programs and policies, structured forward-hedging programs as well as derivative financial instruments (primarily forward contracts, futures contracts, option contracts and financial swap contracts are used). A derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on, or derived from, the value of some underlying asset.
Amerens generation position is partially hedged through regulated and unregulated sales to electric customers. The regulated sales are subject to rate approval mechanisms. UE has an electric rate freeze in place in Missouri through June 30, 2006. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP have electric rate freezes in place in Illinois through January 1, 2007.
IP has contracts to purchase power that expire at the end of 2006. Should power acquired under these agreements be insufficient to meet IPs load requirements, IP will be required to buy power at market prices. Some purchased power agreements oblige the suppliers to provide power up to the reservation amount, and at the same prices, even if individual units are unavailable at various times. Purchased power agreements with other suppliers do not oblige them to acquire replacement power for us in the event of a curtailment or shutdown of their plants. Any costs not covered by rates could not be passed on to ratepayers, which could have an unfavorable impact on IPs results of operations.
With regard to our exposure to commodity price risk for purchased power and market-based electricity sales, Ameren has two subsidiaries, Ameren Energy and Marketing Company, whose primary responsibilities include managing market risks associated with changing market prices for electricity purchased and sold on behalf of UE, Genco and CILCO. Purchases are generally transacted when they are economically beneficial to serve load requirements. In addition, Genco and CILCO have sold nearly all of their available non-rate-regulated peak generation capacity for the 59 summers of 2005 and 2006 at various prices, most of which are fixed.
Similar techniques are used to manage risks associated with fuel exposures for generation. Most UE, Genco and CILCO fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts. Since UE, Genco and CILCO do not have a provision similar to the PGA clause for electric operations, UE, Genco and CILCO have entered into long-term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal and nuclear fuel in order to manage their exposure to fuel prices. The coal hedging strategy is intended to produce reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility. Price and volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through periodic bid procedures, whereby the amount of coal purchased will be determined by the current market prices and the minimum and maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year. We will generally purchase coal up to five years out, but we may purchase coal beyond five years based on favorable market conditions or deal structure. Conversely, the strategy also allows for the decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market conditions.
Transportation costs to deliver coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs. We typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and mitigate transportation price volatility. The natural gas transportation expenses for the distribution companies and the gas fired generation units are controlled by the FERC via published tariffs with rights to extend the contracts from year to year. Depending on our competitive position, we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariffs for our requirements.
The following table presents the estimated annual increase in our total fuel expense and decrease in net income if coal and coal transportation costs were to increase by 1% on any requirements currently not covered by fixed-price contracts for the five-year period 2005 through 2009: Coal Transportation Fuel       Expense Net       Income (a) Fuel       Expense Net       Income (a) Ameren $ 7 $ (5 ) $ 6 $ (4 ) UE 4 (3 ) 4 (3 ) Genco 2 (1 ) 1 - CILCORP (b) 1 - 1 - CILCO 1 - 1 - (a) Calculations       are based on an effective tax rate of 35%.
(b) CILCORP       consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its       balances.
In the event of a significant change in coal prices, UE, Genco and CILCO would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources.
With regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel, UE has fixed-priced and base price with escalation agreements and/or inventories to fulfill its Callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services through 2006. UE expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected remainder of the life of the plant, at prices which cannot now be accurately predicted. UEs strategy is to hedge at least 75% of its three-year requirements .
This strategy permits optimum timing of new forward contracts given the relatively long price cycles in the nuclear fuel markets. It also provides security of supply to protect against unforeseen market disruptions. Unlike electricity and natural gas markets, there are no sophisticated financial instruments in nuclear fuel markets, so most hedging is done via inventories and forward contracts.
With regard to our electric generating operations for UE, Genco and CILCO that are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run the CTs, the natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs. This is accomplished by optimizing transportation and storage o ptions and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins.
Through the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been granted FTRs associated with the advent of the MISO Day Two Market. Marketing Company has been granted FTRs for its participation in the PJM-Com Ed market. We sought and received FTRswith the intent to hedge (offset) expected electric transmission congestion charges related to our physicalelectricity business. Depending on the congestion on thegrid and prices at various points on the electric transmission grid,FTRs could result in either charges or credits. We use complex grid modeling tools to determine which FTRs we wish to nominate in the FTR allocation process. There is a risk that we incorrectly modeled the amount of FTRs we will need, and there is the potential that some of the FTR hedges could be ineffective.
With regard to UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs natural gas distribution businesses, exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact there are gas cost recovery mechanisms (PGA clauses) in place in both Missouri and Illinois. These gas cost recovery mechanisms allow UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred costs of natural gas. To prudently manage costs, our strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations on our regulated natural gas customers. We cannot eliminate the effects of gas price volatility. However, the gas procurement strategy utilizes similar risk management techniques and instruments outlined earlier combined with management of physical assets including storage and operator and balancing agreements.
60 The following table presents the percentages of the projected required supply of coal and coal transportation for our coal-fired power plants, nuclear fuel for UEs Callaway nuclear plant and natural gas for our gas-fired generation (CTs) and retail distribution, as appropriate, which are price-hedged over the five-year period 2005 through 2009: 2005 2006 2007 - 2009 Ameren: Coal 92 % 88 % 49 % Coal       transportation 99 96 64 Nuclear       fuel 100 100 34 Natural       gas for generation 35 8 1 Natural       gas for distribution (b) 89 9 6 UE: Coal 92 % 87 % 45 % Coal       transportation 100 99 61 Nuclear       fuel 100 100 34 Natural       gas for generation 9 6 3 Natural       gas for distribution (b) 100 13 6 CIPS: Natural       gas for distribution (b) 89 % 16 % 13 % Genco: Coal 95 % 88 % 58 % Coal       transportation 98 98 65 Natural       gas for generation 40 7 1 CILCORP: (a) Coal 93 % 92 % 46 % Coal       transportation 97 73 68 Natural       gas for distribution (b) 98 18 12 CILCO: Coal 93 % 92 % 46 % Coal       transportation 97 73 68 Natural       gas for distribution (b) 98 18 12 IP: Natural       gas for distribution (b) 80 % - - (a) CILCORP       consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its       balances.
(b) Represents       the percentage of natural gas price hedged for the peak winter season       which includes the months of November through March. The year 2005       represents the period January 2005 through March 2005. The year 2006       represents November 2005 through March 2006. This continues each       successive year through March 2009.
See Supply for Electric Power under Part I, Item 1, of this report for the percentages of our historical needs satisfied by coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydro and oil. Also see Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information.
Fair Value of Contracts Most of our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales. We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity and emission credits.
Price fluctuations in natural gas, fuel and electricity cause:  an       unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our firm commitments to       purchase or sell when purchase or sales prices under the firm commitment       are compared with current commodity prices;  market       values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power to differ       from the cost of those commodities in inventory under firm commitment; and  actual       cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities to differ from       anticipated cash outlays.
The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by risk-management policies that control the use of forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ameren Corporation : We have completed an integrated audit of Ameren Corporations 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated f inancial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ameren Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) present s fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for asset retirement costs as of January 1, 2003.
Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial 62 reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Illinois Power Company from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2004. We have also excluded Illinois Power Company from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Illinois Power Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameren Corporation whose total assets and total revenues represent 18% and 7%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004.

95 AMEREN CORPORATION (Consolidated) UNION ELECTRIC COMPANY (Consolidated) CENTRAL ILLINOIS PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY AMEREN ENERGY GENERATING COMPANY (Consolidated) CILCORP INC.
(Consolidated) CENTRAL ILLINOIS LIGHT COMPANY (Consolidated) ILLINOIS POWER COMPANY (Consolidated) COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2004 NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES General Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company registered with the SEC under the PUHCA. Amerens primary asset is the common stock of its subsidiaries. Amerens subsidiaries operate rate-regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses, rate-regulated natural gas distribution businesses and non-rate-regulated electric generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois. Dividends on Amerens common stock are dependent on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. Amerens principal subsidiaries are listed below. Also see Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations.
UE,       or Union Electric Company, also known as AmerenUE, operates a       rate-regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution       business, and a rate-regulated natural gas distribution business in       Missouri and Illinois. UE was incorporated in Missouri in 1922 and is       successor to a number of companies, the oldest of which was organized in       1881. It is the largest electric utility in the state of Missouri and       supplies electric and gas service to a 24,500 square mile area located in       central and eastern Missouri and west central Illinois. This area has an       estimated population of 3 million and includes the greater St. Louis area.       UE supplies electric service to 1.2 million customers and natural gas       service to 140,000 customers. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters for       information regarding the proposed transfer of UEs Illinois electric and       natural gas transmission and distribution businesses to CIPS and the       proposed addition of a large new electric customer.
CIPS,       or Central Illinois Public Service Company, also known as AmerenCIPS,       operates a rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and       distribution business in Illinois. CIPS was incorporated in Illinois in       1902. It supplies electric and gas utility service to portions of central       and southern Illinois having an estimated population of 1 million in an       area of 20,000 square miles. CIPS supplies electric service to 325,000       customers and natural gas service to 170,000 customers.
Genco,       or Ameren Energy Generating Company, operates a non-rate-regulated       electric generation business. Genco was incorporated in Illinois in March       2000, in conjunction with the Illinois Customer Choice Law. Genco       commenced operations on May 1, 2000, when CIPS transferred its five       coal-fired power plants representing in the aggregate approximately 2,860       megawatts of capacity and related liabilities to Genco at historical net       book value. The transfer was made in exchange for a subordinated       promissory note from Genco in the amount of $552 million and shares of       Gencos common stock. Since Genco commenced operations, it has acquired 25       CTs, which give it a total installed generating capacity of approximately       4,751 megawatts as of December 31, 2004. Genco is a subsidiary of       Development Company, a subsidiary of Resources Company, which is a       subsidiary of Ameren. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters for       information regarding the proposed transfer of Gencos CTs located in       Pinckneyville and Kinmundy, Illinois to UE.
CILCO,       or Central Illinois Light Company, also known as AmerenCILCO, is a       subsidiary of CILCORP (a holding company) and operates a rate-regulated       electric transmission and distribution business, a primarily       non-rate-regulated electric generation business, and a rate-regulated       natural gas distribution business in Illinois. CILCO was incorporated in       Illinois in 1913. It supplies electric and gas utility service to portions       of central and east central Illinois in areas of 3,700 and 4,500 square       miles, respectively, with an estimated population of 1 million. CILCO       supplies electric service to 205,000 customers and natural gas service to       210,000 customers. In October 2003, CILCO transferred its coal-fired       plants and a CT facility, representing in the aggregate approximately       1,100 megawatts of electric generating capacity, to a wholly owned       subsidiary known as AERG, as a contribution in respect of all the       outstanding stock of AERG and AERGs assumption of certain liabilities.       The net book value of the transferred assets was $378 million. No gain or       loss was recognized, as the transaction was accounted for as a transfer       between entities under common control. The transfer was made in       conjunction with the Illinois Customer Choice Law. CILCORP was       incorporated in Illinois in 1985.
IP,       or Illinois Power Company, also known as AmerenIP, operates a       rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution       business in Illinois. Ameren acquired IP on September 30, 2004, from       Dynegy, which hadacquired it as Illinova in early 2000. IP was       incorporated in 1923 in Illinois. It supplies electric and gas utility       service to portions of central, east central, and southern Illinois,       serving an estimated population of 1.4 million in an area of approximately       15,000 square miles, contiguous to our other service territories. IP       supplies electric service to 600,000 customers and natural gas service to       415,000 customers, including most of the Illinois portion of the greater       St. Louis area. In 1998, in conjunction with the impairment of the       Clinton 96 nuclear power plant, IP underwent a quasi-reorganization.       In October 1999, IP transferred its wholly owned coal-fired generating       assets and other generation-related assets and liabilities at net book       value to a non-rate-regulated subsidiary of Illinova in exchange for an       unsecured note receivable. In 1999, IP sold its Clinton nuclear power       plant to AmerGen and entered into a power purchase agreement with AmerGen,       which required IP to purchase power through December 31, 2004. AmerGen       also assumed responsibility for operating and ultimately decommissioning       the nuclear power plant. Concurrent with the sale to Dynegy in early 2000,       the fossil fuel assets and liabilities were transferred from the Illinova       non-rate-regulated subsidiary to DMG. The unsecured note receivable was       eliminated from IPs balance sheet in conjunction with Amerens       acquisition of IP. See Note 2 - Acquisitions and Note 14 - Related Party       Transactions for further information.
Ameren has various other subsidiaries responsible for the short- and long-term marketing of power, procurement of fuel, management of commodity risks and provision of other shared services. Ameren has an 80% ownership interest in EEI through UE and Resources Company, which each own 40% of EEI. This 80% ownership in EEI includes a 20% interest indirectly acquired by Resources Company from a Dynegy subsidiary on September 30, 2004. Ameren consolidates EEI for financial reporting purposes, while UE and Resources Company report EEI under the equity method.
We use the words our, we or us with respect to certain information to indicate that such information relates to all Ameren Companies. When we refer to financing or acquisition activities, or liquidity arrangements, we are defining Ameren as the parent holding company. When appropriate, subsidiaries of Ameren are named specificallyas we discuss their various business activities.
The financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its majority-owned subsidiaries. As the acquisition of IP occurred on September 30, 2004, Amerens Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows for the periods prior to September 30, 2004, and Amerens Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003, do not reflect IPs results of operations or financial position. Financial information of CILCORP and CILCO reflected in Amerens consolidated financial statements include the period from January 31, 2003, when these companies were acquired. See Note 2 - Acquisitions for further information on the accounting for the IP and CILCORP acquisitions. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, unless otherwise indicated.
In addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total, certain information is expressed in cents per share. These amounts reflect factors that directly impact Ameren's earnings. We believe this per share information is useful because it better enables readers to understand the impact of these factors on Ameren's earnings. All references in this report to earnings per share are based on diluted shares.
Our accounting policies conform to GAAP. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments (which include normal, recurring adjustments) necessary, in our opinion, for a fair presentation of our results. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain reclassifications have been made to make prior-year financial statements conform to 2004 reporting.
As part of the acquisition of IP on September 30, 2004, Ameren pushed down the effects of purchase accounting to the financial statements of IP. Accordingly, IPs postacquistion financial statements reflect a new basis of accounting, and separate financial statement amounts are presented for preacquisition (predecessor) and postacquistion (successor) periods, separated by a bold black line. As a result of the acquisition of IP, certain reclassifications have been made to make IP prior-year financial statements conform to our current presentation. Additionally, as part of the acquisition of CILCORP on January 31, 2003, Ameren pushed down the effects of purchase accounting to the financial statements of CILCORP, but not to any of CILCORPs subsidiaries. Accordingly, CILCORPs postacquistion financial statements reflect a new basis of accounting, and separate financial statement amounts are presented for predecessor and successor periods. CILCOs financial statements are presented on a historical basis of accounting for all periods presented.
Regulation Ameren is subject to regulation by the SEC. Certain Ameren subsidiaries are also regulated by the MoPSC, the ICC, the NRC, and the FERC. In accordance with SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP defer certain costs pursuant to actions of our rate regulators. These companies are currently recovering such costs in rates charged to customers. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters for further information.
97 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and temporary investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. The allowance is determined based on application of a historical write-off factor to the amount of outstanding receivables, including unbilled revenue, and a review for collectibility of certain accounts over 90 days past due.
Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the average cost method. The following table presents a breakdown of materials and supplies for each of the Ameren Companies at December 31, 2004 and 2003: Ameren (a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP CILCO IP (b) 2004: Fuel (c) $ 250 $ 61 $ - $ 64 $ 75 $ 8 $ - Gas       stored underground 191 33 44 - 40 41 74 Other       materials and supplies 182 105 12 25 19 19 11 $ 623 $ 199 $ 56 $ 89 $ 134 $ 68 $ 85 2003: Fuel (c) $ 227 $ 58 $ - $ 65 $ 94 $ 12 $ - Gas       stored underground 107 27 41 - 39 39 72 Other       materials and supplies 153 90 10 25 21 18 12 $ 487 $ 175 $ 51 $ 90 $ 154 $ 69 $ 84 (a) 2003       amounts exclude amounts for IP; includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and       non-Registrant Ameren subsidiaries as well as intercompany       eliminations.
(b) 2003       amounts represent predecessor information.
(c) Consists       of coal, oil, propane, and tire chips.
Property and Plant We capitalize the cost of additions to and betterments of units of property and plant. The cost includes labor, material, applicable taxes, and overhead. An allowance for funds used during construction, or the cost of borrowed funds and the cost of equity funds (preferred and common stockholders equity) applicable to rate-regulated construction expenditures, is also added for our rate-regulated assets. Interest during construction is added for non-rate-regulated assets. Maintenance expenditures and the renewal of items not considered units of property are expensed as incurred. When units of depreciable property are retired, the original costs, less salvage value, are charged to accumulated depreciation. Asset removal costs incurred by our non-rate-regulated operations, which do not constitute legal obligations, were expensed as incurred, beginning in 2003. Asset removal costs accrued by our rate-regulated operations, which do not constitute legal obligations, are classified as a regulatory liability. See Accounting Changes and Other Matters relating to SFAS No. 143 below and Note 4 - Property and Plant, Net for further information.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided over the estimated lives of the various classes of depreciable property by applying composite rates on a straight-line basis. The provision for depreciation for the Ameren Companies in 2004, 2003 and 2002 ranged from 3% to 4% of the average depreciable cost. Beginning in January 2003, with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, depreciation rates for our non-rate-regulated assets were reduced to reflect the discontinuation of the accrual of dismantling and removal costs. See Accounting Changes and Other Matters relating to SFAS No. 143 below for further information.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction In our rate-regulated operations, we capitalize the allowance for funds used during construction, which is a utility industry accounting practice. Allowance for funds used during construction does not represent a current source of cash funds. This accounting practice offsets the effect on earnings of the cost of financing current construction, and it treats such financing costs in the same manner as construction charges for labor and materials.
Under accepted ratemaking practice, cash recovery of allowance for funds used during construction, as well as other construction costs, occurs when completed projects are placed in service and reflected in customer rates. The following table presents the allowance for funds used during 98 construction ranges of rates that were used during 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 Ameren (a) 1%       - 9 % 3%       - 4 % 5%       - 9 % UE 5 4 5 CIPS 1 3 9 CILCORP (b) and CILCO 1 3 6 IP (b) 9 7 3 (a) Excludes       rates for CILCORP and CILCO prior to January 31, 2003, and IP prior to the       acquisition date of September 30, 2004.
(b) Represents       predecessor information for CILCORP prior to January 31, 2003, and for IP       prior to September 30, 2004.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Amerens, CILCORPs and IPs goodwill relates to the acquisitions of IP and an additional 20% ownership interest in EEI in 2004 and CILCORP and Medina Valley in 2003. See Note 2 - Acquisitions for additional information regarding the acquisitions.
Leveraged Leases Certain Ameren subsidiaries own interests in assets that have been financed as leveraged leases. Amerens investment in these leveraged leases represents the equity portion, generally 20% of the total investment, either as an undivided interest in the equipment or as a part owner through a partnership. At the time of lease inception, a debit for rents receivable and estimated residual value was recorded with a credit to unearned income. These amounts are then adjusted over time as rents are received, income is realized, and the asset is eventually sold. Ameren and CILCORP account for these investments as a net investment in these assets; they do not include the amount of outstanding debt becausethe third-party debt is nonrecourse to Ameren and the Ameren subsidiaries.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets as compared with the carrying value of the assets. If impairment has occurred, we recognize the amount of the impairment by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value.
Environmental Costs Environmental costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Estimated environmental expenditures are based on internal and third-party estimates, which are regularly reviewed and updated. Costs are expensed or deferred as a regulatory asset when it is expected that the costs will be recovered from customers in future rates. If environmental expenditures are related to facilities currently in use, such as pollution control equipment, the cost is capitalized and depreciated over the expected life of the asset.
Unamortized Debt Discount, Premium and Expense Discount, premium and expense associated with long-term debt are amortized over the lives of the related issues.
Revenue Utility Revenues Our utility operating companies (UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP) record operating revenue for electric and gas service when delivered to customers. We accrue an estimate of electric and gas revenues for service rendered, but unbilled, at the end of each accounting period.
Interchange Revenues The following table presents the interchange revenues included in Operating Revenues - Electric for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 Ameren (a)(b) $ 404 $ 351 $ 259 UE 340 320 257 CIPS 37 37 35 Genco 163 140 99 CILCORP (c) 46 19 10 CILCO 46 19 10 IP (d) - - 7 (a) Excludes       amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004;       excludes amounts for CILCORP prior to the acquisition date of January 31,       2003; and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant       subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.
(b) Includes       interchange revenues at EEI of $53 million for the year ended December 31,       2004 (2003 - $56 million; 2002 - $59 million).
(c) 2002       amounts represent predecessor information. 2003 amounts include January       2003 predecessor information, which was $3 million. CILCORP consolidates       CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its   balances.
(d) 2002       and 2003 amounts represent predecessor information. 2004 amount includes       January - September 2004 predecessor information which was less than $1       million.
99 Trading Activities We present the revenues and costs associated with certain energy contracts designated as trading on a net basis in Operating Revenues - Electric and Other.
Purchased Power The following table presents the purchased power expenses included in Operating Expenses - Fuel and Purchased Power for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions for further information on affiliate purchased power transactions.
2004 2003 2002 Ameren (a) $ 454 $ 294 $ 167 UE 203 179 229 CIPS 325 341 418 Genco 150 152 119 CILCORP (b) 43 205 155 CILCO 43 202 155 IP (c) 624 681 698 (a) Excludes       amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004;       excludes amounts for CILCORP prior to the acquisition date of January 31,       2003; and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant       subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.
(b) 2002       amounts represent predecessor information. 2003 amounts include January       2003 predecessor information, which was $12 million. CILCORP consolidates       CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its   balances.
(c) 2002       and 2003 amounts represent predecessor information. 2004 amount includes       January - September 2004 predecessor information which was $496 million.
Fuel and Gas Costs In UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs retail electric utility jurisdictions, there are no provisions for adjusting rates in response to changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation. In UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs retail gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers through PGA clauses.
UEs cost of nuclear fuel is amortized to fuel expense on a unit-of-production basis. Spent fuel disposal cost, based on net kilowatthours generated and sold, is charged to expense.
Stock-based Compensation Effective January 1, 2003, Ameren adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, by using the prospective method of adoption under SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, for all employee awards granted or with terms modified on or after January 1, 2003.
Prior to 2003, Ameren, CILCORP and IP accounted for stock options granted under long-term incentive plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. No stock-based employee compensation cost was recognized for options granted under Amerens plan, either under the AES Stock Option Plan in which CILCORPs employees participated or under the equity compensation plans of Dynegy in which IP employees participated, as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
Effective January 1, 2003, predecessor IP adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, with respect to options granted to its employees under Dynegys plans, by using the prospective method of adoption under SFAS No. 148. As a result, all stock options granted after January 1, 2003, were accounted for on a fair value basis. IP incurred compensation expense over the vesting period of the options in an amount equal to the fair value of the options. On October 1, 2004, as a result of Amerens acquisition of IP, all unvested stock options granted to IP employees became null and void.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (as revised SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which revises SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25. SFAS No. 123R will require companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The fair value of the award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date; the changes in fair value will be recognized as compensation cost in each period. The fair-value based method in this statement is similar to the fair-value based method in SFAS No. 123 in most respects. SFAS No. 123R is effective for Ameren for the quarterly period ending September 30, 2005. The statement applies to all awards granted or modified after the effective date. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity upon adoption.
100 Had compensation cost for all stock options and stock awards granted prior to 2003 been determined on a fair-value basis consistent with SFAS No. 123, net income would have approximated the following pro forma amounts for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

CILCORP       information subsequent to 2002 is not presented, as all CILCORP options       were either paid out or assumed by AES in connection with Amerens       acquisition of CILCORP. For IP, compensation expense recorded for stock       options granted after January 1, 2003, was negligible for the nine months       ended September 30, 2004, and the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.       On October 1, 2004, as a result of Amerens acquisition of IP, all       unvested stock options granted to IP employees became null and void.       Therefore, information subsequent to September 30, 2004 is not presented.
See Note 12 - Stock-based Compensation for further information.
Excise Taxes Excise taxes reflected on Missouri electric, Missouri gas, and Illinois gas customer bills are imposed on us. They are recorded gross in Operating Revenues and Taxes Other than Income Taxes. Excise taxes reflected on Illinois electric customer bills are imposed on the consumer. They are recorded as tax collections payable and included in Taxes Accrued. The following table presents excise taxes recorded in Operating Revenues and Taxes Other than Income Taxes for the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 Ameren (a) $ 134 $ 137 $ 116 UE 103 101 103 CIPS 13 14 13 Genco - - - CILCORP (b) 12 24 16 CILCO (c) 12 24 16 IP (d) 36 40 41 (a) Excludes       amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; and       excludes amounts for CILCORP and CILCO prior to the acquisition date of       January 31, 2003.
(b) 2002       amounts represent predecessor information. 2003 amounts include January       2003 predecessor information, which was $2 million. CILCORP consolidates       CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its   balances.
(c) With       the exception of taxes reflected on CILCO customer bills issued prior to       October 27, 2003, excise taxes at CILCO are recorded as tax collections       payable and are included on the Balance Sheet as Taxes       Accrued.
(d) 2002       and 2003 amounts represent predecessor information. 2004 amount includes       January - September 2004 predecessor information, which was $30 million.
101 Income Taxes Ameren uses an asset and liability approach for its financial accounting and reporting of income taxes, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for transactions that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax return purposes. These deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by statutory enacted tax rates.
We recognize that regulators will probably reduce future revenues for deferred tax liabilities initially recorded at rates in excess of the current statutory rate. Therefore,reductions in the deferred tax liability, which were recorded due to decreases in the statutory rate, were credited to a regulatory liability.A regulatory assethas been established to recognize the probable future recovery in rates of future income taxes resulting principally from the reversal of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction - Equity and temporary differences related to property, plant, and equipment acquired before 1976, which were an unrecognized temporary difference prior to the adoption of SFAS 109.
Investment tax credits used on tax returns of prior years have been deferred for book purposes; they are being amortized over the useful lives of the related properties. Deferred income taxes were recorded on the temporary difference represented by the deferred investment tax credits and a corresponding regulatory liability, which recognizes the expected reduction in rate revenue for future lower income taxes associated with the amortization of the investment tax credits, was recorded. See Note 13 - Income Taxes for the treatment of IPs unamortized investment tax credits and deferred tax liabilities upon the acquisition of IP by Ameren.
Earnings Per Share There were no differences between the basic and diluted earnings per share amounts for Ameren in 2004 and 2003. The inclusion of assumed stock option conversions in the calculation of earnings per share resulted in dilution of $0.01 per share for 2002. The assumed stock option conversions increased the number of shares outstanding in the diluted earnings per share calculation by 196,709 shares in 2004, 289,244 shares in 2003 and 332,909 shares in 2002. As only the Ameren parent company has publicly held common stock, earnings per share calculations are not relevant, so they are not presented for any of the other Ameren Companies.
Accounting Changes and Other Matters SFAS No.143 - Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143, effective January 1, 2003.
SFAS No. 143 provides the accounting requirements for asset retirement obligations associated with tangible, long-lived assets. SFAS No. 143 requires us to record the estimated fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which the liabilities are incurred and to capitalize a corresponding amount as part of the book value of the related long-lived asset. In subsequent periods, we are required to make adjustments in asset retirement obligations based on changes in estimated fair value. Corresponding increases in asset book values are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset. Uncertainties as to the probability, timing or amount of cash flows associated with an asset retirement obligation affect our estimates of fair value.
Upon adoption of the standard, Ameren and Genco recognized a net after-tax gain of $18 million in the first quarter of 2003 for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Prior to Amerens acquisition of CILCORP, predecessor CILCORP and CILCO recognized a net after-tax gain in 2003 of $4 million and $24 million, respectively, for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. In addition, in accordance with SFAS No. 143, estimated net future removal costs associated with Amerens, UEs, CIPS, CILCORPs and CILCOs rate-regulated operations that had previously been embedded in accumulated depreciation were reclassified as a regulatory liability.
Prior to Amerens acquisition of IP, predecessor IP recognized a net after-tax loss upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 of $2 million for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.
At January 1, 2004, IPs asset retirement obligation liability totaled $1 million for obligations under an operating lease. This asset retirement obligation related to the dismantling of the generation plant and remediation of the plant site at Tilton, Illinois, which IP had leased to DMG. In July 2004, IP sold the Tilton assets to DMG and eliminated the related asset retirement obligation liability as part of the accounting for that transaction. Thus, IP had no asset retirement obligation liabilities recorded at December 31, 2004.
Upon adoption of SFAS No. 143, UE recorded asset retirement obligations related to UEs Callaway nuclear plant decommissioning costs and to retirement costs for a UE river structure. Additionally, Genco recorded an asset retirement obligation for the retirement costs for a Genco power plant ash pond. CILCORP and CILCO recorded asset retirement obligations related to CILCOs power plant ash ponds (now owned by AERG).
Asset retirement obligations at Ameren and UE increased by $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, to reflect the accretion of obligations to their present value. Increases to Gencos, CILCORPs and CILCOs asset retirement obligations due to accretion were immaterial during this period. Substantially all of this accretion was recorded as an increase to regulatory assets. Additionally, Ameren and CILCOs asset retirement obligations increased by approximately $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, due to revisions in estimated future cash flows to retire CILCOs ash ponds.
102 In addition to those obligations that have been identified and valued, we determined that certain other asset retirement obligations exist. However, we were unable to estimate the fair value of those obligations because the probability, timing, or cash flows associated with the obligations were indeterminable. We do not believe that these obligations, when incurred, will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
The fair value of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund for UEs Callaway nuclear plant is reported in Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund in Amerens and UEs Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount is legally restricted: It may be used only to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. Changes in the fair value of the trust fund are recorded as an increase or decrease to the regulatory asset recorded in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 143.
In June 2004, the FASB issued an exposure draft on a proposed interpretation of SFAS No. 143. The FASB is expected to issue a final interpretation in the first quarter of 2005. Under the interpretation, a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity that is conditional on a future event is within the scope o f SFAS No. 143 .
Accordingly, an entity would be required to recognize a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation that is conditional on a future event if the liability's fair value can be estimated reasonably. The exposure draft provides examples of conditional asset retirement obligations that may need to be recognized under the provisions of the interpretation, including asbestos removal. This proposed interpretation could require accrual of additional liabilities by Ameren and its subsidiaries and could result in increased expense, which, while not yet quantified, could be material. This proposed interpretation would be effective for us no later than December 31, 2005, if issuedin its current form.
FIN No. 46 - Consolidation of Variable-interest Entities In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, which changed the consolidation requirements for special-purpose entities (SPEs) and non-special-purpose entities (non-SPEs) that meet the criteria for designation as variable-interest entities (VIEs). In December 2003, the FASB revised FIN No. 46 (FIN No. 46R) to clarify certain aspects of FIN No. 46 and to modify the effective dates of the new guidance. FIN No. 46R provides guidance on the accounting for entities that are controlled through means other than voting rights by another entity. FIN No. 46R requires a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is designated as the primary beneficiary.
The Ameren Companies do not have any interests in entities that are considered SPEs, other than IP's investment in IP LLC. FIN No. 46R was effective on March 31, 2004, for any interests the Ameren Companies held in non-SPEs. The adoption of FIN No. 46R did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Ameren Companies. However, in connection with the adoption of FIN No. 46R, we have determined that the following significant variable-interests are held by the Ameren Companies:  EEI.       Ameren has an 80% ownership interest in EEI through UEs 40% interest and       Resources Companys 40% interest. Under the FIN No. 46R model, Ameren, UE,       and Resources Company have a variable-interest in EEI, and Ameren is the       primary beneficiary. Accordingly, Ameren will continue to consolidate EEI,       and UE will continue to account for its investment in EEI under the equity       method of accounting. The maximum exposure to loss as a result of these       variable-interests in EEI is limited to Amerens, UEs, and Resources       Companys equity investments in EEI.
Tolling       agreement. CILCO has a variable-interest in Medina Valley through a       tolling agreement to purchase steam, chilled water, and electricity. We       have concluded that CILCO is not the primary beneficiary of Medina Valley.       Accordingly, CILCO does not consolidate Medina Valley. The maximum       exposure to loss as a result of this variable-interest in the tolling       agreement is not material.
Leveraged       lease and affordable housing partnership investments. Ameren, UE and       CILCORP have investments in leveraged lease and affordable housing       partnership arrangements that are variable-interests. We have concluded       that none of these companies is a primary beneficiary of any of the VIEs       related to these investments. The maximum exposure to loss as a result of       these variable-interests is limited to the investments in these       arrangements. At December 31, 2004, Ameren and CILCORP had net investments       in leveraged leases of $140 million and $113 million, respectively. At       December 31, 2004, Ameren, UE, and CILCORP had investments in affordable       housing partnerships of $19 million, $6 million, and $7 million,       respectively.
IP       SPT. Ameren acquired a variable-interest in IP SPT with the acquisition of       IP on September 30, 2004. IP has a variable-interest in IP SPT, which was       established in 1998 to issue TFNs. IP has indemnified and is liable to IP       SPT if IP does not bill the applicable charges to its customers on behalf       of IP SPT or if it does not remit the collection to IP SPT; however, the       note holders are considered the primary beneficiaries of this       special-purpose trust. Accordingly, Ameren and IP do not consolidate IP       SPT.
FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 106-1 and FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 106-2 - Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Medicare 103 Prescription Drug Act) became law. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act introduced a prescription drug benefit for retirees under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy for sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Through its postretirement benefit plans, Ameren provides retirees with prescription drug coverage that we believe is actuarially equivalent to the Medicare prescription drug benefit. In January 2004, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 106-1, which permitted a plan sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one-time election to defer the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug Act. We made this one-time election allowed by FSP SFAS 106-1.
In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 106-2, which superseded FSP SFAS 106-1. FSP SFAS 106-2 provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug Act for employers whose prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to the drug benefit under Medicare Part D. Ameren elected to adopt FSP SFAS 106-2 during the second quarter ended June 30, 2004, retroactive to January 1, 2004. See Note 11 - Retirement Benefits for additional information on the impact of adoption of FSP SFAS 106-2.
Predecessor IPs adoption of FSP SFAS 106-2 on July 1, 2004, had no impact on IPs results of operations, financial position or liquidity because its drug benefit was not actuarially equivalent to the drug benefit under Medicare Part D.
EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments In March 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-1, which provides guidance on evaluating whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. The recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1, which were to be effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2004, were delayed by the issuance of FSP EITF 03-1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,  in September 2004. During the period of delay, we will continue to evaluate our investments, which primarily constitute our Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund, as required by existing authoritative guidance.
NOTE 2 - ACQUISITIONS IP and EEI On September 30, 2004, Ameren completed the acquisition of all the common stock and 662,924 shares of preferred stock of IP (based in Decatur, Illinois) and an additional 20% ownership interest in EEI from Dynegy and its subsidiaries. Ameren acquired IP to complement its existing Illinois gas and electric operations. The purchase included IPs rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business serving 600,000 electric and 415,000 gas customers in areas contiguous to our existing Illinois utility service territories. With the acquisition, IP became an Ameren subsidiary operating as AmerenIP.
For a discussion of the regulatory agency approvals granted in connection with this acquisition, see Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters.
The total transaction value was $2.3 billion, including the assumption of $1.8 billion of IP debt and preferred stock and consideration, including transaction costs, of $443 million in cash, net of $51 million cash acquired. In February 2005, Ameren received $5 million from Dynegy representing the final working capital adjustment pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement. Ameren placed $100 million of the cash portion of the purchase price in a six-year escrow account pending resolution of certain contingent environmental obligations of IP and other Dynegy affiliates for which Ameren has been provided indemnification by Dynegy. See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies for information on the IP environmental matter to which the indemnification and escrow applies. In addition, this transaction included a fixed-price capacity power supply agreement for IPs annual purchase in 2005 and 2006 of 2,800 megawatts of electricity from DYPM. The contract was marked to fair value at closing of the acquisition. This agreement is expected to supply about 70% of IPs electric customer requirements during those two years. The remaining 30% of IPs power needs in 2005 and 2006 will be supplied by other companies. In the event that any of these suppliers are unable to supply the electricity required by these agreements, IP would be forced to find alternative suppliers to meet its load requirements, thus exposing itself to market price risk, which could have a material impact on Amerens and IPs results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
Amerens financing plan for funding this acquisition included the issuance of new Ameren common stock. Ameren issued an aggregate of 30 million common shares in February 2004 and July 2004, which generated net proceeds of $1.3 billion. Proceeds from these issuances were used to finance the cash portion of the purchase price and to reduce IP debt assumed as part of this transaction and to pay related premiums. See Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings for information on redemptions and repurchases of certain IP indebtedness after the acquisition.
The following table presents the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of Amerens acquisition of IP and the additional 20% ownership interest in EEI.
Ameren is completing its valuations of the net assets and liabilities of IP and EEI acquired, including third-party valuations of property and plant, intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, and contingent obligations. As a result, the allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject to further adjustment.
We expect to finalize purchase accounting in 2005. The fair value of IPs 104 power supply agreements including the fixed-price capacity power supply agreement with DYPM, discussed above recorded at the acquisition date resulted in a net liability of $109 million. In addition, we recorded a fair value adjustment, resulting in a net asset of $24 million, for IPs power supply agreement with EEI that expires at the end of 2006.
T he excess of the purchase price for IPs common stock and preferred stock over tangible net assets acquired has been allocated preliminarily to goodwill in the amount of $320 million, net of future tax benefits. For income tax purposes, we expect that a portion of the purchase price will be allocated to goodwill and that such portion will be deducted ratably over a 15-year period. No specifically identifiable intangible assets have been identified.
Current       assets $ 374 Property       and plant 1,967 Investments       and other noncurrent assets 387 Goodwill 320 Total       assets acquired 3,048 Current       liabilities 234 Long-term       debt, including current maturities 1,982 Other       noncurrent liabilities 450 Total       liabilities assumed 2,666 Preferred       stock assumed 13 Net       assets acquired $ 369 The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents a summary of Amerens consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, as if the acquisition of IP had been completed at the beginning of 2003, including pro forma adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to reflect the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired net assets. The pro forma financial information does not include cost savings that may result from the combination of Ameren with IP.
For       the years ended December 31, 2004 2003 Operating       revenues $ 6,320 $ 6,123 Income       before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 677 663 Cumulative       effect of change in accounting principle, net of taxes - 16 Net       income $ 677 $ 679 Earnings       per share - basic $ 3.49 $ 3.55 -       diluted $ 3.48 $ 3.55 This pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations as they would have been had the transaction been effected on the assumed date, nor is it an indication of trends for future results.
IPs Note Receivable from Former Affiliate of $2.3 billion was eliminated as of September 30, 2004, and prior to Amerens acquisition of IP to meet the conditions of the closing. Steps to eliminate the Note were made: (1) reducing the principal balance by offsetting certain payables owed by IP to Illinova and other Dynegy entities; (2) offsetting the principal balance by the amount of interest that had been paid by Illinova to IP, but not yet earned; and (3) eliminating a portion in consideration of Illinovas assumption of IPs net deferred tax obligation and IPs contemporaneous repurchase (and cancellation immediately thereafter) of 39,892,213 of IP common shares. The 12,751,724 IP treasury shares held as of December 31, 2003, were canceled in 2004. The remaining principal balance of IPs Note Receivable from Former Affiliate was eliminated, as part of IPs overall recapitalization, with a corresponding reduction to IPs retained earnings. The elimination of IPs Note Receivable from Former Affiliate had no impact on IPs predecessor results of operations.
The portion of the total transaction value attributable to Amerens acquisition of Dynegys 20% ownership interest in EEI now held by Resources Company was $125 million. This transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition. T he excess of the purchase price for this ownership interest over 20% of the fair value of EEIs net assets acquired has been preliminarily allocated to property and plant ($80 million) and emission allowances ($41 million), partially offset by a net liability for power supply agreements ($24 million) and a reduction to net deferred tax assets ($38 million). The remaining excess was allocated to goodwill in the amount of $54 million, subject to change based on our final valuation.
CILCORP and Medina Valley On January 31, 2003, Ameren completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of CILCORP from AES.
CILCORP is the parent company of CILCO (based in Peoria, Illinois). With the acquisition, CILCO became an indirect Ameren subsidiary, but it remains a separate utility company, operating as AmerenCILCO .
On February 4, 2003, Ameren also completed the acquisition from AES of Medina Valley, which indirectly owns a 40-megawatt, gas-fired electric generation plant. The results of operations for CILCORP and Medina Valley were included in Amerens consolidated financial statements effective with the respective January and February 2003 acquisition dates.
The total acquisition cost was $1.4 billion and included the assumption by Ameren of CILCORP and Medina Valley debt of $895 million and consideration of $479 million in cash, net of $38 million cash acquired. The purchase price allocation for the acquisition of CILCORP and Medina Valley was finalized in January 2004, resulting in an $8 million decrease in goodwill primarily due to January 2004 adjustments to property and plant, income tax accounts, and accrued severance expenses. The following table presents the final estimated fair values of the assets acquired and 105 liabilities assumed at the dates of our acquisitions of CILCORP and Medina Valley.
Current       assets $ 323 Property       and plant 1,162 Investments       and other noncurrent assets 154 Specifically       identifiable intangible assets 6 Goodwill 561 Total       assets acquired 2,206 Current       liabilities 190 Long-term       debt, including current maturities 937 Other       noncurrent liabilities 521 Total       liabilities assumed 1,648 Preferred       stock assumed 41 Net       assets acquired $ 517 Specifically identifiable intangible assets of $6 million compriseretail customer contracts, which are subject to amortization with an average life of 10 years. Goodwill of $561 million (CILCORP - $554 million; Medina Valley - $7 million) was recognized in connection with the CILCORP and Medina Valley acquisitions. None of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
NOTE 3 - RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS Below is a summary of significant regulatory proceedings. With respect to pending matters, we are unable to predict theultimate outcome of these regulatory proceedingsthe timing of the final decisions of the various agencies or the impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
IP and EEI Acquisition Ameren received all the regulatory agency approvals necessary to acquire IP and a 20% interest in EEI from Dynegy on September 30, 2004.
The principal ongoing condition of the FERCs approval of the acquisition was that 125 megawatts of EEIs power be sold to a nonaffiliate of Ameren. The Missouri Office of Public Counsel and a group of electric industrial customers of UE, both interveners in the FERC proceeding, have asked the FERC to reconsider its order deferring to the MoPSC on the question of whether UE should be required to preserve its current entitlement to the output of EEIs Joppa power plant facility. These appeals, which are pending, did not impede the completion of the acquisition on September 30, 2004. IP joined the MISO on September 30, 2004, satisfying an additional condition of the FERCs approval of the acquisition.
The ICC order approving Amerens acquisition of IP contains several important provisions, including the following:  The       order requires IP to submit quarterly reports in 2005 and 2006 on certain       milestones regarding IPs progress in achieving an estimated $33 million       in annual synergies by the beginning of 2007, and provides for adjustments       in IPs next electric and gas rate cases if IP fails to achieve those       milestones.
Commencing       in 2007, IP will recover over four years, through rates, $67 million in       reorganization costs related to the integration of IP into the Ameren       system and the restructuring of IP. As of December 31, 2004, $59 million       of reorganization costs were incurred and deferred as a regulatory       asset.
The       order approves a tariff rider to recover the costs of asbestos-related       litigation claims, subject to the following terms: beginning in 2007, 90%       of cash expenditures in excess of the amount included in base electric       rates will be recovered by IP from a $20 million trust fund established by       IP and financed with contributions of $10 million each by Ameren and       Dynegy; if cash expenditures are less than the amount in base rates, IP       will contribute 90% of the difference to the fund; once the trust fund is       depleted, 90% of allowed cash expenditures in excess of base rates will be       recovered through charges assessed to customers under the tariff       rider.
Ameren       commits to cause an aggregate of at least $750 million principal amount of       IPs long-term debt, including IPs $550 million principal amount of       mortgage bonds 11.50% Series due 2010, to be redeemed, repurchased or       retired on or before December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2004, $700       million principal amount of IP debt was retired in accordance with this       provision.
The       order provides IP with the ability to declare and pay $80 million of       dividends on its common stock in 2005 and $160 million of dividends on its       common stock cumulatively through 2006, provided IP has achieved an       investment grade credit rating from S&P or Moodys. If, however, IPs       $550 million principal amount of mortgage bonds 11.50% Series mortgage       bonds due 2010 are not eliminated by December 31, 2006, IP may not       thereafter declare or pay common dividends without seeking authority from       the ICC. As of December 31, 2004, less than $1 million of the 11.50%       Series mortgage bonds due 2010 were outstanding.
IP       will establish a dividend policy comparable to the dividend policy of       Amerens other Illinois utilities consistent with achieving and       maintaining a common equity to total capitalization ratio between 50% to       60%.
Ameren       will commit IP to make between $275 million and $325 million in energy       infrastructure investments over its first two years of       ownership.
Intercompany Transfer of Electric Generating Facilities and Illinois Service Territory In July 2004, the FERC approved the transfer from Genco to UE, at net book value ($240 million) of 550 megawatts of CTs, but the transfer remains subject to SEC approval under the PUHCA. Approval by the ICC is not required, contingent upon prior approval and execution of UEs transfer of its Illinois public utility operations to CIPS, as discussed below. Approval by the MoPSC is not required in order for this transfer of generating capacity to occur.
106 However, the MoPSC has jurisdiction over UEs ability to recover the cost of the transferred generating facilities from its electric customers in its rates.
In May 2003, UE announced its plan to limit its public utility operations to the state of Missouri and to discontinue operating as a public utility subject to ICC regulation. UE is seeking to accomplish this by transferring its Illinois-based electric and natural gas businesses, including its Illinois-based distribution assets and certain of its transmission assets, at net book value, to CIPS. In 2004, UEs Illinois electric and gas service territory generated revenues of $165 million and had a net book property and plant value of $126 million at December 31, 2004. UE's electric generating facilities and a certain minor amount of its electric transmission facilities in Illinois would not be part of the transfer. UE proposes to transfer about half of the assets directly to CIPS in consideration for a CIPS subordinated promissory note, and approximately half of the assets by means of a dividend in kind to Ameren, followed by a capital contribution by Ameren to CIPS. The transfer was approved by the FERC in December 2003. In September 2004, the ICC authorized the transfer of UEs Illinois-based natural gas utility business. The ICC had already authorized the transfer of UEs Illinois-based electric utility business to CIPS in 2000. In February 2005, the MoPSC issued an order that approved the transfer subject to various conditions described below. The transfer of UE's Illinois-based utility businesses will also require the approval of the SEC under the provisions of the PUHCA. A filing seeking approval of both the transfer of UEs Illinois-based utility businesses and Gencos CTs was made with the SEC in October 2003. If completed, the transfers will be accounted for at book value with no gain or loss recognition, which is the appropriate treatment for transactions of this type between two entities under common control.
The MoPSC order approving UEs transfer of its Illinois-based utility businesses to CIPS included the following principal conditions:  The       order prevents UE from recovering in rates up to 6% of unknown UE       generation-related liabilities associated with the generation that was       formerly allocated to UEs Illinois service territory unless UE can show       the benefits of the transfer of the Illinois service territory outweigh       these costs in future rate cases.
The       order requires an amendment to the jointdispatch agreement among UE,       Genco and CIPS, to declare that margins on short-term power sales will be       divided based on generation output as opposed to load. This amendment is       expected to provide UE with additional annual margins and Genco with       reduced annual margins of $7 million to $24 million. However, this       reduction to Gencos margins is expected to be mitigated by margins       received from additional power sales by Genco (through Marketing Company)       to CIPS to serve the transferred UE Illinois-based electric power business       through the end of 2006 under the current power supply contracts.
The       order requires that, in a future rate case, revenues UE could have       received for incremental energy transfers under the joint dispatch       agreement resulting from the service territory transfer be imputed based       on market prices unless UE can show the benefits of the transfer of the       Illinois service territory outweigh the difference between the market       prices and the actual cost-based charges for such incremental energy       transfers.
Although not expressing dissatisfaction with the MoPSC order, UE, in February 2005, moved the MoPSC to clarify its order to provide that UE may complete the transfer prior to receipt of all regulatory approvals necessary to effectuate the required amendment to the joint dispatch agreement and also to provide that for rate-making purposes, the joint dispatch agreement amendment should be deemed to be made by UE as of the date the transfer is closed. This clarification of the MoPSC order is needed, according to UEs motion, to facilitate timely electric service to Noranda Aluminum, Inc. as discussed below. Also in February 2005, the Missouri Office of Public Counsel filed an application for rehearing of the MoPSC order asserting that the order is unlawful, unjust, unreasonable and arbitrary in various ways.
See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions for a more detailed discussion of the joint dispatch agreement.
Missouri Electric In August 2002, a stipulation and agreement resolved an excess earnings complaint brought against UE by the MoPSC staff following the expiration of UE's experimental alternative regulation plan. The resolution became effective following agreement by all parties to the case and approval by the MoPSC. The stipulation and agreement includes the following principal features.
Missouri Electric  The       phase-in of $110 million of electric rate reductions through April 2004,       $50 million of which was retroactively effective as of April 1, 2002, $30       million of which became effective on April 1, 2003, and $30 million of       which became effective on April 1, 2004.
A       rate moratorium providing for no changes in rates before July 1, 2006,       subject to certain statutory and other exceptions.
A       commitment to contribute $14 million to programs for low-income energy       assistance and weatherization, promotion of energy efficiency and economic       development in UEs service territory in 2002, with additional payments of       $3 million made annually on June 107 30,       2003 through June 30, 2006. This entire obligation was expensed in       2002.
A       commitment to make $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion in critical energy       infrastructure investments from January 1, 2002 through June 30, 2006,       including, among other things, the addition of more than 700 megawatts of       new generation capacity and the replacement of steam generators at UEs       Callaway nuclear plant. The 700 megawatts of new generation is expected to       be satisfied by UEs addition of 240 megawatts in 2002 and the proposed       transfer at net book value to UE of approximately 550 megawatts of       generation assets from Genco, which is subject to receipt of necessary       regulatory approvals. See Intercompany Transfer of Electric Generating       Facilities and Illinois Service Territory within this Note for additional       information on the proposed transfer.
An       annual reduction in UEs depreciation rates by $20 million, retroactive to       April 1, 2002, based       on an updated analysis of asset values, service lives, and accumulated       depreciation levels.
A       one-time credit of $40 million that was accrued during the plan period.       The entire amount was paid to UEs Missouri retail electric customers in       2002 for settlement of the final sharing period under the alternative       regulation plan that expired June 30, 2001.
A       cost of service study must be filed by January 1, 2006.
Gas In January 2004, a stipulation and agreement resolved a request by UE to increase annual natural gas rates. The resolution became effective following agreement by all parties to the case and approval by the MoPSC. The stipulation and agreement authorized an increase in annual gas delivery rates of $13 million, effective February 15, 2004. Other principal features of the stipulation and agreement include:  A       rate moratorium prohibiting changes in gas delivery rates before July 1,       2006, absent the occurrence of a significant, unusual event that has a       major impact on UE.
A       commitment to make $15 million to $25 million in infrastructure       improvement investments from July 1, 2003, through December 31, 2006,       including replacement of cast iron main and unprotected steel service       lines. UE agreed not to propose rate adjustments to recover infrastructure       costs through a statutory infrastructure system replacement surcharge       prior to January 1, 2006.
Commitments       to contribute an aggregate of $310,000 annually to programs for low-income       weatherization, energy assistance, and energy-efficient equipment in UEs       service territory.
Authority to Serve Noranda UE filed in December 2004 with the MoPSC for authority to extend its Missouri electric service territory to include the area where Noranda Aluminum, Inc. (Noranda) is located. Earlier in December, Noranda and UE signed a 15-year agreement to supply up to approximately 470 megawatts (peak load) electric service (or approximately 5% of UEs generating capability, including purchases) to Norandas primary aluminum smelter in southeast Missouri. The supply agreement would become effective June 1, 2005, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The conditions include the MoPSC granting UE authority to extend its service territory to include the Noranda facility; completion of the transfer to UE of 550 megawatts of CTs at Pinckneyville and Kinmundy, Illinois, by Genco, as discussed above in this Note under Intercompany Transfer of Electric Generating Facilities and Illinois Service Territory; completion of the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory, also as discussed under that caption in this Note; and approval by the MoPSC of a proposed large customer transmission service rate. In February 2005, UE and other parties executed and filed a stipulation resolving all of the outstanding issues pending before the MoPSC. The stipulation is consistent in all material respects with UEs application filed in December 2004. The MoPSCis expected to issue an order by the end of March 2005. The transmission arrangements to allow for UE to serve Noranda are subject to FERC approval. In February 2005, the MJMEUC filed a protest at the FERC as to UEs filing made in January 2005 to amend the Interchange Agreeement. In its protest, the MJMEUC recommended that the FERC approve UEs proposed amendment, but requested that the FERC condition its approval on UE being required to comply, after the fact, with the MISO Study Process.In early March 2005, UE filed its responsecontending that the FERC should not impose any conditions on the filing. A decision by the FERC is expected in late March 2005.
Illinois Electric In 2002, all of the Illinois residential, commercial and industrial customers of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP had a choice in electric suppliers under the provisions of 1997 Illinois legislation related to the restructuring of the Illinois electric industry (the Illinois Customer Choice Law).
Under the Illinois Customer Choice Law, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP rates initially were frozen through January 1, 2005.
Due to an amendment to the Illinois Customer Choice Law, the rate freeze was extended through January 1, 2007. As a result of this extension, and pursuant to orders of the ICC, CIPS and Marketing Company and CILCO and AERG extended their respective power supply agreements through December 31, 2006.
See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions for a discussion of these affiliate power supply agreements.
108 The Illinois Customer Choice Law contains a provision requiring that half of excess earnings from the Illinois jurisdiction for the years 1998 through 2006 be refunded to UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs Illinois customers. Excess earnings are defined by the Illinois Customer Choice Law as the portion of the two-year average annual rate of return on common equity in excess of 1.5% of the two-year average of the Index. The Index is defined as the sum of the average for the 12 months ended September 30 of the average monthly yields of the Treasury long-term average plus 7% for both UE and CIPS, 11% for CILCO and 8.5% for IP. Estimated refunds totaling less than $1 million to UEs Illinois customers are expected to be made during the period from April 1, 2004, through March 31, 2005, resulting from excess earnings during the year ended December 31, 2003. No refunds to CIPS, CILCOs or IPs Illinois customers are expected to be made during that period.
On December 31, 2006, the current Illinois electric rate freeze expires, as do supply contracts for generation to serve the power requirements of CIPS, CILCO and IP expire. Prior to December 31, 2006, determinations must be made as to how all Illinois distribution companies will procure their generation needs and how they will set future rates for the generation components and delivery service components of customer rates.
During 2004, the ICC conducted workshops to seek input from interested parties on the framework for retail electric rate determination and generation procurement after the current Illinois electric rate freeze and supply contracts expire on December 31, 2006. A report issued by the ICC in late 2004 outlines a process that received strong support in the workshops: It would have CIPS, CILCO and IP procure power through an auction monitored by the ICC. The form of power supply would meet the full requirements of the utility and the risk of fluctuations in power requirements would be borne by the supplier. In addition, the report noted that many stakeholders, including Ameren, supported a process whereby the price of power resulting from the auction would be the price used to determine the generation component of customer rates. This purchased power would be charged to customers through a pass-through mechanism. With regard to the delivery service component of customer rates, it is expected that all Illinois delivery service companies will file rate cases, at which time the delivery service component of customer rates will be updated. Genco and AERG would probably participate in the auction, but there may be a limit imposed by the ICC on the maximum amount of power they could supply CIPS, CILCO and IP. In February 2005, CIPS, CILCO and IP filed with the ICC a proposed format for the generation procurement auction, a rate mechanism to pass generation costs through to customers, and a process to update the delivery service portion of rates, among other things. These proposals are subject to review and approval by the ICC within eleven months of the filings. In addition, the Illinois legislature began hearings regarding the framework for retail rate determination and generation procurement in February 2005. We cannot predict what actions, if any, the Illinois legislature will take, or whether the ICC will approve our proposals for generation procurement or electric rate determination.
Gas In June 2004, IP filed with the ICC seeking authority to raise its natural gas delivery rates. In supplemental testimony, IP revised its requested rate increase to $25 million annually. The ICC staff in its rebuttal testimony recommended an increase in rates of $10.5 million. In January 2005, IP and the other parties in the proceeding submitted a partial settlement. If approved by the ICC, it will permit a rate increase of $11 million to $14 million. Issues relating to the proposed disallowance of costs associated with IPs Hillsboro storage field were not resolved by the parties settlement; they were the subject of hearings held in January 2005. By law, the ICC is required to issue its decision about the partial settlement and the contested issues by May 2005. In the order approving Amerens acquisition of IP, the ICC prohibits IP from filing for any proposed increase in gas delivery rates to be effective prior to January 1, 2007, beyond IPs pending request for a gas delivery rate increase. The ICC staff has proposed a disallowance of $7.6 millions part of IPs 2003 PGA reconciliation proceeding related to the Hillsboro storage field.
In October 2003, the ICC issued orders awarding CILCO, CIPS and UE increases in annual natural gas delivery rates of $9 million, $7 million and $2 million, respectively. These new rates went into effect in November 2003.
Federal Regional Transmission Organization In December 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000, which required all utilities subject to the FERC jurisdiction to state their intentions for joining a RTO. The MoPSC issued an order in early 2004 authorizing UE to participate in the MISO for a five-year period, with participation after that period subject to further approvals by the MoPSC. Subsequently, the FERC issued a final order allowing UEs and CIPS participation in the MISO. Under these orders, the MoPSC continues to set the transmission component of UEs rates to serve its bundled retail load. CILCO was already a member of the MISO; it transferred functional control of its transmission system to the MISO prior to our acquisition of CILCO. Genco does not own transmission assets, but pays the MISO to use the transmission system to transmit power from the Genco generating plants.
109 On May 1, 2004, functional control, but not ownership, of UEs and CIPS transmission systems was transferred to the MISO through GridAmerica LLC. On September 30, 2004, prior to the completion of Amerens acquisition of IP as required by the FERCs order approving the acquisition, IP transferred functional control, but not ownership, of its transmission system to the MISO. The transfers had no accounting impact on UE, CIPS and IP because they continue to own the transmission system assets. The participation by UE, CIPS and IP in the MISO is expected to increase annual costs by $10 million to $25 million in the aggregate. This could also result in a decrease in annual revenues of between $5 million and $15 million in the aggregate, depending upon the MISOs tariff structure. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP may also be required to expand their transmission systems according to decisions made by the MISO rather than according to their internal planning process.
As a part of the transfer of functional control of UEs and CIPS transmission systems to the MISO, Ameren received $26 million, which represented the refund of the $13 million exit fee paid by UE and the $5 million exit fee paid by CIPS, both of which were expensed when they left the MISO in 2001, plus $1 million interest on the exit fees and the reimbursement of $7 million that was invested in the proposed Alliance RTO. These refunds resulted in after-tax gains of $11 million, $8 million, and $3 million for Ameren, UE, and CIPS, respectively, which were recorded in other operations and maintenance expenses during the quarter ended June 30, 2004. As part of the transfer of functional control of IPs transmission system to the MISO at the end of September 2004, IP also received a refund of its MISO exit fee, plus interest on the exit fee, and RTO development costs resulting in after-tax gains of $9 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2004.
During late 2003 and early 2004, the FERC had ordered the elimination of regional through-and-out rates assessed by the MISO on transmission service between the MISO and PJM regions, to be effective May 1, 2004. However, in March 2004, the FERC accepted an agreement among affected transmission owners that retained the regional through-and-out rates until December 1, 2004. It also provided for continued negotiations aimed at developing a long-term transmission pricing structure based on specified principles to eliminate seams between the PJM and the MISO regions. In November 2004, the FERC announced that it had approved the new pricing structure to eliminate the seams between the MISO and PJM. The new rate structure applies for a fixed period ending January 31, 2008, and is based on the license plate rate design currently in place in both the MISO and PJM, under which payment of a single fee applicable to the transmission pricing zone in which the transmission customers load is located entitles that customer to transmission service over the entire combined system. However, to avoid an abrupt cost shift as a result of the elimination of pancaked rates between the MISO and PJM, the FERC also ordered the adoption of Seams Elimination Cost Adjustments (SECA). In late November 2004, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP made SECA filings with the FERC. Numerous comments were filed in January 2005. In February 2005, the FERC accepted for filing the SECA filings submitted in the proceeding to become effective December 1, 2004, subject to refund and surcharge as appropriate, and it established hearing procedures. Until the SECA filings have finally been approved by the FERC, we cannot predict the ultimate impact that such rate structure will have on UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs costs and revenues.
In March 2004, the MISO tendered for filing at the FERC a proposed Open Access Transmission and Energy Markets Tariff (the Energy Markets Tariff), which is intended to supersede its existing OATT. The Energy Markets Tariff establishes rates, terms and conditions necessary for implementation of a centralized economic dispatch platform, including locational marginal-cost pricing and FTRs for transmission service within the MISO region. The Energy Markets Tariff also establishes market monitoring and mitigation procedures and codifies existing resource adequacy requirements placed on the MISO members by their states or applicable RRO. The MISO initially proposed to make the Energy Markets Tariff effective on December 1, 2004, subject to its ability to implement the Energy Markets Tariff. However, implementation of the Energy Markets Tariff is now expected to be effective on April 1, 2005. On August 6, 2004, the FERC accepted the MISOs Energy Markets Tariff, subject to further compliance filings. On November 8, 2004, the FERC issued an order denying the requests for rehearing that were filed by a number of the MISO stakeholders including Ameren. However, a final order from the FERC on the compliance filings made by the MISO in response to the FERCs August 6 order is still pending. At this time, Ameren is unable to determine the full impact that the Energy Markets Tariff will have until further information is available regarding the implementation of the Energy Markets Tariff.
Until UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP achieve some degree of operational experience participating in the MISO, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that such participation or ongoing RTO developments at the FERC or other regulatory authorities will have on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
Hydroelectric License Renewal In November 2004, the FERC formally accepted UEs February 2004 license renewal application, and it solicited terms and conditions from the U.S. Department of Interior and various state agencies to renew the license for its Osage hydroelectric plant for an additional 50-year term. The current FERC license expires on February 28, 2006. The license application proposes to continue operations at the Osage 110 plant as a peaking facility, to upgrade four turbine units, and to maximize the hydroelectric capacity of the plant.
New Market Power Analysis Screen Order In an order issued in April 2004, the FERC replaced the Supply Margin Assessment Screen previously used to review the applications by sellers of electricity at wholesale for authorization to sell power at market-based rates. The new system uses two alternative measures of market power: (1) a pivotal supplier analysis and (2) a market share analysis, which is to be prepared on a seasonal basis. Applicants located in a RTO with sufficient market structure and a single energy market were permitted to base these measures of market power on the size of the market in the geographic region under the control of the RTO. Other applicants were required to base these measures of market power on the size of the market in the control area in which they operate. If the applicant passes both screens, a rebuttable presumption will exist that it lacks generation market power. If the applicant fails either screen, a rebuttable presumption will exist that it has market power. Under such circumstances, the applicant may either seek to rebut the presumption by preparing a delivered price test (identifying the amount of economic capacity from neighboring areas that can be delivered to the control area) or propose mitigation measures. Unless some other mitigation measure is adopted, the applicants authority to sell power at market-based rates in areas where it has market power will be revoked, and the applicant will be required to sell at cost-based rates in those areas.
UE, Genco, CIPS, CILCO, AERG, Development Company, Marketing Company, and Medina Valley currently have authorization from the FERC to sell power at market-based rates. As required, these Ameren companies filed an updated market power analysis with the FERC in December 2004. All of the Ameren companies pass both screen measures for the market consisting of the entire MISO footprint. In their December filing, they wrote that because MISOs Day Two Markets, at such date, were scheduled to begin March 1, 2005, the MISO footprint was the only relevant market for measuring whether any of the Ameren companies possess market power as defined by the FERC. Also in their December filing, they offered to submit supplemental information that applies the new tests to smaller markets consisting of the control areas in which the Ameren companies sell power, if the MISO Day Two Markets did not begin on March 1, 2005, as originally scheduled. In January 2005, the effective date of the MISO Day Two was moved to April 1, 2005; however, with only a one-month delay, we still believe that applying the new screens on the basis of the entire MISO footprint is inappropriate. In January 2005, the Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility Commission (MJMEUC) filed a protest to our December filing. The MJMEUC is an association of Missouri municipal customers, that purchase transmission service from Ameren. In its protest, the MJMEUC contends that the Ameren companies have not shown they lack market power, that the MISO footprint is not the relevant market, and that the MISO's energy markets will not be sufficient to protect consumers from market power abuses, especially with respect to long-term markets. In February 2005, the Ameren companies filed a response to the MJMEUCs protest, responding to each of these claims. We are unable to anticipate how or when the FERC will respond to our December filing and to any supplemental filing. Therefore, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact the new screens will have on our ability to sell power at market-based rates.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities In accordance with SFAS No. 71, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP defer certain costs pursuant to actions of regulators and are currently recovering such costs in rates charged to customers.
The following table presents our regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003: Ameren (a) UE CIPS CILCORP (b) CILCO IP (c) 2004: Regulatory       assets: Income       taxes (d)(e) $ 335 $ 332 $ 2 $ 1 $ 1 $ - Asset       retirement obligation (e)(f) 124 124 - - - - Callaway       costs (g) 73 73 - - - - Unamortized       loss on reacquired debt (e)(h) 89 37 6 5 5 41 Recoverable       costs - contaminated facilities (e)(i) 87 1 25 4 4 57 IP       integration (j) 59 - - - - 59 Recoverable       costs - debt fair value adjustment (k) 40 - - - - 40 Other (e)(l) 22 18 - 1 1 1 Total       regulatory assets $ 829 $ 585 $ 33 $ 11 $ 11 $ 198 Regulatory       liabilities: Income       taxes (m) $ 219 $ 189 $ 13 $ 17 $ 17 $ (1) Removal       costs (n) 823 587 138 21 159 77 Total       regulatory liabilities $ 1,042 $ 776 $ 151 $ 38 $ 176 $ 76 111 Ameren (a) UE CIPS CILCORP (b) CILCO IP (c) 2003: Regulatory       assets: Income       taxes (d)(e) $ 431 $ 425 $ - $ 6 $ 6 $ - Asset       retirement obligation (e)(f) 122 122 - - - - Callaway       costs (g) 77 77 - - - - Unamortized       loss on reacquired debt (e)(h) 46 36 5 5 5 47 Recoverable       costs - contaminated facilities (e)(i) 27 - 23 4 4 39 Transition       period cost-recovery (o) - - - - - 117 Clinton       decommissioning cost-recovery (p) - - - - - 5 Other (e)(l) 26 25 - 1 1 - Total       regulatory assets $ 729 $ 685 $ 28 $ 16 $ 16 $ 208 Regulatory       liabilities: Income       taxes (m) $ 127 $ 96 $ 14 $ 17 $ 17 $ 57 Removal       costs (n) 697 556 131 7 150 72 Total       regulatory liabilities $ 824 $ 652 $ 145 $ 24 $ 167 $ 129 (a) Excludes       amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004;       includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant subsidiaries and       intercompany eliminations.
(b) CILCORP       consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances.
(c) 2003       amounts represent predecessor information.
(d) Amount       represents SFAS No. 109 deferred tax asset. See Note 13 - Income Taxes for       amortization period.
(e) These       assets do not earn a return.
(f) Represents       recoverable costs for asset retirement obligations at our rate-regulated       operations. See SFAS No. 143 discussion in Note 1 - Summary of Significant       Accounting Policies.
(g) Represents       UEs Callaway nuclear plant operations and maintenance expenses, property       taxes, and carrying costs incurred between the plant in-service date and       the date the plant was reflected in rates. These costs are being amortized       over the remaining life of the plants current operating license through       2024.
(h) Represents       losses related to repaid debt. These amounts are being amortized over the       lives of the related new debt issues or the remaining lives of the old       debt issues if no new debt was issued.
(i) Represents       the recoverable portion of accrued environmental site liabilities       primarily collected from electric and gas customers through ICC approved       revenue riders in Illinois.
(j) Represents       reorganization costs related to the integration of IP into the Ameren       system and the restructuring of IP. Per the ICC order approving Amerens       acquisition of IP, these costs are recoverable over four years after 2006       through rates.
(k) Represents       a portion of IPs unamortized debt fair value adjustment recorded upon       Amerens acquisition of IP at September 30, 2004. This portion will be       amortized over the remaining life of the related debt upon expiration of       the electric rate freeze in Illinois in 2006.
(l) Represents       Y2K expenses being amortized over six years starting in 2002, in       conjunction with the 2002 settlement of UEs Missouri electric rate case       and a DOE decommissioning assessment being amortized over 14 years through       2007. In addition, this amount includes the portion of merger-related       expenses applicable to the Missouri retail jurisdiction, which are being       amortized through 2007 based on a MoPSC order.
(m) Represents       unamortized portion of investment tax credit and federal excess taxes. See       Note 13 - Income Taxes for amortization period.
(n) Represents       estimated funds collected for the eventual dismantling and removing plant       from service, net of salvage value, upon retirement related to our       rate-regulated operations. See SFAS No. 143 discussion in Note 1 - Summary       of Significant Accounting Policies.
(o) Represents       potentially noncompetitive investment costs (stranded costs) that IP was       allowed to recover from retail customers during the transition period       (until December 31, 2006) through frozen bundled rates and transition       charges from customers who select other electric suppliers.
(p) Represents       ICC-allowed decommissioning costs associated with IPs former nuclear       plant. The regulatory asset for the probable future collections from rate       payers of decommissioning costs was amortized as the decommissioning costs       are collected. See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies for further       discussion.
UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP continually assess the recoverability of their regulatory assets. Under current accounting standards, regulatory assets are written off to earnings when it is no longer probable that such amounts will be recovered through future revenues. Electric industry restructuring legislation may affect the recoverability of electric regulatory assets in the future.
IPs predecessor financial statements included a cost-recovery asset related to the recovery of certain stranded costs during the Illinois Customer Choice Law transition period, which extends until December 31, 2006. IP had recorded a regulatory asset of $341 million in 1998 for the portion of its stranded costs it expected to recover during the transition period. The transition-period cost-recovery asset amortization reflected in IPs predecessor statement of income was $29 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2004, $39 million in 2003, and $71 million in 2002. No value was assigned to the transition-period cost-recovery asset in the allocation of the purchase price for IP upon the acquisition by Ameren on September 30, 2004. See Note 2 - Acquisitions for more information regarding the purchase price allocation.
112 NOTE 4 - PROPERTY AND PLANT, NET The following table presents property and plant, net for each of the Ameren Companies at December 31, 2004 and 2003: Ameren (a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP CILCO IP (b) 2004: Property       and plant, at original cost: Electric $ 18,050 $ 11,082 $ 1,314 $ 2,538 $ 1,008 $ 1,560 $ 1,490 Gas 1,248 312 302 - 176 455 458 Other 262 39 5 - 48 2 1 19,560 11,433 1,621 2,538 1,232 2,017 1,949 Less:       Accumulated depreciation and amortization 6,994 4,885 673 831 105 904 30 12,566 6,548 948 1,707 1,127 1,113 1,919 Construction       work in progress: Nuclear       fuel in process 90 90 - - - - - Other 641 437 5 42 52 52 65 Property       and plant, net $ 13,297 $ 7,075 $ 953 $ 1,749 $ 1,179 $ 1,165 $ 1,984 2003: Property       and plant, at original cost: Electric $ 16,050 $ 10,715 $ 1,289 $ 2,530 $ 981 $ 1,475 $ 2,279 Gas 743 282 295 - 166 445 770 Other 211 37 5 - 2 2 - 17,004 11,034 1,589 2,530 1,149 1,922 3,049 Less:       Accumulated depreciation and amortization 6,591 4,688 642 777 58 857 1,199 10,413 6,346 947 1,753 1,091 1,065 1,850 Construction       work in progress: Nuclear       fuel in process 66 66 - - - - - Other 441 346 8 21 36 36 99 Property       and plant, net $ 10,920 $ 6,758 $ 955 $ 1,774 $ 1,127 $ 1,101 $ 1,949 (a) 2003 amounts exclude amounts for IP; includes amounts for non-Registrant Ameren subsidiaries as well as intercompany eliminations.

NOTE 5 - SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LIQUIDITY Short-term borrowings typically consist of commercial paper issuances and drawings under committed bank credit facilities with maturities generally within 1 to 45 days.
The following table summarizes the short-term borrowing activity and relevant interest rates for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively: Ameren (a) UE IP (b) 2004: Short-term       borrowings at December 31, 2004 $ 417 $ 375 $ - Average       daily borrowings outstanding during the year 47 33 - Weighted       average interest rate during 2004 2.19% 1.56% 0.0% Peak       short-term borrowings during 2004 419 375 - Peak       interest rate during 2004 2.97% 2.40% 0.0% 2003: Short-term       borrowings at December 31, 2003 $ 161 $ 150 $ - Average       daily borrowings outstanding during the year 24 24 33 Weighted       average interest rate during 2003 1.10% 1.10% 2.60% Peak       short-term borrowings during 2003 228 228 100 Peak       interest rate during 2003 2 .08% 1.20% 2.60% (a) Excludes       amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004;       excludes amounts for CILCORP prior to the acquisition date of January 31,       2003; and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant       subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.
(b) 2003       represents predecessor information.
At December 31, 2004, certain of the Ameren Companies had committed bank credit facilities totaling $1,164 million, $789 million of which was available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short-term borrowing authorizations, by UE, CIPS, CILCO, IP, and Ameren Services through a utility money pool arrangement. At December 31, 2004, UE had $375 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, which reduced the available amounts under these facilities. All of the $789 million was available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short-term borrowing authorizations, by Ameren directly, by CILCORP through direct short-term borrowings from Ameren, and by most of the non-rate-regulated subsidiaries including, but not limited to, Resources Company, Genco, Marketing Company, AFS, 113 AERG, and Ameren Energy, through a non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool agreement. Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries to coordinate and provide for certain short-term cash and working capital requirements. Separate money pools are maintained between rate-regulated and non-rate-regulated entities. In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement exists between Ameren, IP and Ameren Services, which enables IP to make short-term borrowings directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the utility money agreement, together with any outstanding external short-term borrowings by IP, may not exceed $500 million pursuant to authorizations from the ICC and the SEC under the PUHCA. Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration of the agreements. See Note 14 - Related Party Transactions for a detailed explanation of the money pool arrangements and the unilateral borrowing agreement. The committed bank credit facilities are used to support our commercial paper programs under which $375 million was outstanding for Ameren on a consolidated basis at December 31, 2004 (2003 - $150 million). Access to our credit facilities for all Ameren Companies is subject to reduction based on use by affiliates.
In April 2004, UE renewed, for an additional one-year term, its $75 million 364-day committed credit facility, which is to be used for general corporate purposes, including support of its commercial paper program. This facility makes borrowings available at various interest rates based on London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), agreed rates, and other options. CIPS, CILCO and IP can access this facility through the utility money pool agreement.
In July 2004, Ameren entered into two new revolving credit facilities totaling $700 million to be used for general corporate purposes, including support of Ameren and UE commercial paper programs. The $700 million in new facilities includes a $350 million three-year revolving credit facility and a $350 million five-year revolving credit facility. These new credit facilities replaced Amerens existing $235 million 364-day revolving credit facility, which matured in July 2004, and a $130 million multiyear revolving credit facility, which would have matured in July 2005. In September 2004, an existing Ameren $235 million multiyear revolving facility, which matures in July 2006, was amended and restated to accommodate Amerens acquisition of IP and to conform with the two credit facilities entered into in July 2004.
EEI has two bank credit agreements totaling $45 million with maturities through June 2005. At December 31, 2004, $7 million was available under these committed credit facilities.
Borrowings under Amerens non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool agreement by Genco, Development Company, and Medina Valley, each an exempt wholesale generator, are considered investments for purposes of the 50% SEC aggregate investment limitation. Based on Amerens aggregate investment in these exempt wholesale generators as of December 31, 2004, the maximum permissible borrowings under Amerens non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool pursuant to this limitation for these entities totaled $507 million.
Indebtedness Provisions and Other Covenants Certain of the Ameren Companies bank credit agreements contain provisions which, among other things, place restrictions on the ability to incur liens, sell assets, and merge with other entities. Certain of these credit agreements also contain a provision that limits Amerens, UEs, CIPS and CILCOs total indebtedness to 60% of total capitalization pursuant to a calculation defined in the agreement. Exceeding these debt levels would result in a default under the credit arrangements. As of December 31, 2004, the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization (calculated in accordance with this provision) for Ameren, UE, CIPS and CILCO was 50%, 44%, 53% and 43%, respectively (2003 - 52%, 44%, 54%, 53%). From and after March 31, 2005, IPs total indebtedness will also be limited by this provision. In addition, certain of these credit agreements contain indebtedness cross-default provisions and material adverse change clauses that could trigger a default under these facilities in the event that any of Amerens subsidiaries (subject to the definition in the underlying credit agreements), other than certain project finance subsidiaries, defaults in indebtedness in excess of $50 million. The credit agreements also require us to meet minimum ERISA funding rules.
None of the Ameren Companies credit agreements or financing arrangements contain credit rating triggers. One of EEIs credit agreements contains a credit rating trigger under which a default can occur in the event any of the sponsors (as defined in the credit agreements) credit rating falls below Baa3 or BBB- by Moodys and S&P and the sponsor does not cover a payment default. A $100 million CILCO bank term loan containing a credit rating trigger was repaid in February 2004. At December 31, 2004, the Ameren Companies and EEI were in compliance with their credit agreement provisions and covenants .

The following table presents the authorized amounts under Form S-3 shelf registration statements filed and declared effective for certain of the Ameren Companies as of January 31, 2005: Authorized Date Authorized Amount Issued Available Ameren (a) June       2004 $ 2,000 $       459 $ 1,541 UE (b) September       2003 1,000 689 311 CIPS May       2001 250 150 100 (a) Ameren       issued securities totaling $875 million under the August 2002 shelf       registration statement and $459 million under the September 2003 shelf       registration statement.
(b) UE       issued securities totaling $200 million in 2003, $404 million in 2004 and       $85 million in January 2005.
117 Ameren In February 2004, Ameren issued, pursuant to an August 2002 SEC Form S-3 shelf registration statement, 19.1 million shares of its common stock at $45.90 per share, for net proceeds of $853 million. This issuance substantially depleted all of the capacity under the August 2002 shelf registration statement. In June 2004, the SEC declared effective a Form S-3 shelf registration statement filed by Ameren and its subsidiary trusts covering the offering from time to time of up to $2 billion of various types of securities, including long-term debt, trust preferred securities, and equity securities. In July 2004, Ameren issued, pursuant to the June 2004 Form S-3 shelf registration statement, 10.9 million shares of its common stock at $42.00 per share, for net proceeds of $445 million. The proceeds from both of these offerings were used to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of IP and Dynegy's 20% interest in EEI and, as described below under IP, to reduce IP debt assumed as part of the acquisition and to pay related premiums.
The purchase of IP on September 30, 2004, included the assumption of IP debt and preferred stock at closing of $1.8 billion. The assumed debt and preferred stock included $936 million of mortgage bonds, $509 million of pollution control indebtedness supported by mortgage bonds, $352 million of TFNs issued by IP SPT, and $13 million of preferred stock not acquired and owned by Ameren. Upon acquisition, total IP debt was increased to fair value by $191 million. The adjustment to the fair value of each debt series is being amortized over its remaining life, or to the expected redemption date, to interest expense.
In March 2004, the SEC declared effective a Form S-3 registration statement filed by Ameren in February 2004, authorizing the offering of 6 million additional shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are, at Amerens option, newly issued shares or treasury shares, or shares purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Ameren is currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under DRPlus. In December 2001, Ameren began issuing new shares of common stock in connection with certain of our 401(k) plans pursuant toeffective Form S-8 registration statement. Under DRPlus and our 401(k) plans, Ameren issued a total of 2.3 million shares of common stock in 2004 valued at $107 million. Under the DRPlus and our 401(k) plans, Ameren issued 2.5 million and 2.3 million shares of common stock in 2003 and 2002, respectively, which were valued at $105 million and $93 million for the respective years.
In March 2002, Ameren issued $345 million of adjustable conversion-rate equity security units and $227 million (gross proceeds) of common stock (5 million shares at $39.50 per share and 750,000 shares, pursuant to the exercise of an option granted to the underwriters, at $38.865 per share). The $25 adjustable conversion-rate equity security units each consisted of an Ameren senior unsecured note with a principal amount of $25 and a contract to purchase, for $25, a fraction of a share of Ameren common stock on May 15, 2005. The senior unsecured notes were recorded at their fair value of $345 million and will mature on May 15, 2007. Total distributions on the equity security units were originally made at an annual rate of 9.75%, consisting of quarterly interest payments on the senior unsecured notes at the initial annual rate of 5.20% and contract adjustment payments under the stock purchase contracts at the annual rate of 4.55%. In February 2005, the annual interest rate on $375 million principal amount of Amerens senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2007, was reset from 5.20% to 4.263%. The stock purchase contracts require holders to purchase 8.7 million to 7.4 million shares of Ameren common stock on May 15, 2005, at the market price at that time, subject to a minimum share purchase price of $39.50 and a maximum of $46.61. The stock purchase contracts included a pledge of the related senior unsecured notes as collateral for the stock purchase obligation. As a result of the February 2005 remarketing of the senior unsecured notes, treasury securities were substituted for the senior unsecured notes and are currently pledged as collateral for the stock purchase obligation and the senior unsecured notes were released from the pledge. In 2002, we recorded the net present value of the stock purchase contract adjustment payments of $46 million as an increase in Other Deferred Credits and Liabilities to reflect our obligation and a decrease in Other Paid-in Capital to reflect the fair value of the stock purchase contract. The liability for the stock purchase contract adjustment payments (December 31, 2004 - $6 million; December 31, 2003 - $21 million) will be reduced as such payments are made through May 15, 2005.
As discussed above, in February 2005, the annual interest rate on the $345 million principal amount of Amerens senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2007 was reset from 5.20% to 4.263%. These senior unsecured notes were originally issued in March 2002 as a component of Amerens publicly traded adjustable conversion-rate equity security units. As required by the original terms of the agreement, the interest rate was reset because Ameren remarketed these senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the remarketing of the senior unsecured notes were used by the former holders of the adjustable conversion-rate equity security units to purchase treasury securities to secure their obligations to purchase Ameren common stock pursuant to the stock purchase contracts in May 2005. As part of this remarketing, Ameren also repurchased $95 million in principal amount of the senior unsecured notes; it has subsequently retired these notes.
UE In 2004, UE received a capital contribution from Ameren totaling $16 million, as a result of an allocation of income tax benefit in 2004 and 2003, pursuant to the tax-allocation agreement among the Ameren Companies.
118 UE had a lease agreement, scheduled to expire on August 31, 2031, that provided for the financing of a portion of its nuclear fuel that was processed for use or was consumed at UEs Callaway nuclear plant. In February 2004, UE terminated this lease with a final payment of $67 million made in January 2004.
In February and March 2004, in connection with the delivery of bond insurance policies to secure the environmental improvement and pollution control revenue bonds (Series 1991, 1992, 1998A, 1998B, 1998C, 2000A, 2000B and 2000C) previously issued by the Missouri Environmental Authority, UE delivered separate series of its first mortgage bonds (which are subject to fallaway provisions, as defined in the related financing agreements, similar to those included in its first mortgage bonds that secure UEs senior secured notes) to secure its respective obligations under the existing loan agreements with the Missouri Environmental Authority relating to such environmental improvement and pollution control revenue bonds. As a result, the environmental improvement and pollution control revenue bonds were rated Aaa, AAA, and AAA by Moodys, S&P, and Fitch, respectively.
In May 2004, UE issued, pursuant to its September 2003 SEC Form S-3 shelf registration statement, $104 million of 5.50% senior secured notes due May 15, 2014, with interest payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year beginning in November 2004. UE received net proceeds of $103 million, which were used to redeem its $100 million 7.00% first mortgage bonds due 2024.
In September 2004, UE issued, pursuant to its September 2003 SEC Form S-3 shelf registration statement, $300 million of 5.10% senior secured notes due October 1, 2019, with interest payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning in April 2005. UE received net proceeds of $298 million, which were used to repay short-term debt temporarily incurred to fund the maturity of UEs $188 million 6.875% first mortgage bonds on August 1, 2004, and to repay other short-term debt, which consisted of borrowings under the utility money pool arrangement.
In January 2005, UE issued, pursuant to its September 2003 SEC Form S-3 shelf registration statement, $85 million of 5.00% senior secured notes due February 1, 2020, with interest payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year beginning in August 2005. UE received net proceeds of $83 million, which were used to repay short-term debt temporarily incurred to fund the maturity of UEs $85 million 7.375% 2004 first mortgage bonds.
In December 2002, upon receipt of all necessary federal and state regulatory approvals, UE, pursuant to Missouri economic development statutes, conveyed most of its Peno Creek CT facility to the city of Bowling Green, Missouri in exchange for the issuance by the city of a taxable industrial development revenue bond in the amount of $103 million. Concurrently, the city leased back the facility to UE for a term of 20 years. The lease term is the same as the final maturity of the bond purchased by UE. Although the lease is a capital lease, no capital was raised in the transaction. UE is responsible for making rental payments under the lease in an amount sufficient to pay the debt service of the bond. The city's ownership of the facility during the term of the bond and the lease will result in property tax savings to UE. Under the terms of the lease, UE retains all operation and maintenance responsibilities for the facility and ownership of the facility is returned to UE at the expiration of the lease.
CIPS In November 2004, CIPS issued, through the Illinois Finance Authority, $35 million of Series 2004 environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds due in 2025, currently in a variable-rate Dutch auction interest rate mode. These bonds are insured by a bond insurance policy and secured by first mortgage bonds (which are subject to fallaway provisions, as defined in the related financing agreements, similar to those which secure CIPS senior secured notes). As a result, the environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds were rated Aaa, AAA, and AAA by Moodys, S&P, and Fitch, respectively. The proceeds received from the issuance of the $35 million Series 2004 bonds were used to redeem, at par, CIPS $35 million 6.375% 1993 Series A due 2028 pollution-control revenue bonds.
In December 2004, CIPS redeemed prior to maturity, $18 million of its 5.90% 1993 Series B-2 pollution control bonds due 2028 and $17 million of its $25 million 5.70% 1993 Series C-2 pollution control bonds due 2026. These redemptions were made with available cash and borrowings from the utility money pool agreement.
Ameren, UE and CIPS may sell all, or a portion of, the remaining securities registered under their open SEC registration statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and its rules and regulations.
CILCORP In conjunction with Amerens acquisition of CILCORP, CILCORPs long-term debt was recorded at fair value. This resulted in recognition of fair-value adjustment increases of $71 million related to CILCORPs 9.375% senior bonds due 2029 and $40 million related to its 8.70% senior notes due 2009. Amortization related to these fair value adjustments was $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 (2003 - $7 million), and was included in interest expense in the 119 Consolidated Statements of Income of Ameren and CILCORP.
In May 2004, CILCORP repurchased $15 million in principal amount of its 9.375% senior bonds. In July 2004, it repurchased an additional $2 million in principal amount of these bonds. In conjunction with these debt repurchases, the fair-value adjustment on these bonds was reduced by $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.
CILCO In February 2004, CILCO repaid its secured bank term loan totaling $100 million with borrowings from the utility money pool agreement.
In November 2004, CILCO issued, through the Illinois Finance Authority, $19 million of Series 2004 environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds due in 2039, currently in a variable-rate Dutch auction interest rate mode. These bonds are insured by a bond insurance policy and are secured by first mortgage bonds (which are subject to fallaway provisions, as defined in the related financing agreements, similar to those included in the first mortgage bonds which secure UEs and CIPS' senior secured notes). As a result, the environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds were rated Aaa, AAA, and AAA by Moodys, S&P, and Fitch, respectively. The Series 2004 bonds are subject to a mandatory sinking fund redemption totaling $5 million at par on October 1, 2026, with the remainder of $14 million in principal amount due October 1, 2039. The proceeds received from the issuance were used to redeem CILCOs $14 million 6.50% Series 1992 A due 2018 and $5 million 6.50% Series 1992 C due 2010 pollution control revenue bonds.
IP In conjunction with Amerens acquisition of IP, IPs long-term debt was increased to fair value by $195 million. Amortization related tofair-value adjustments was $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 (2003 - $1 million) and was included in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income of Ameren and IP.
In November 2004, pursuant to an equity clawback provision in the related bond indenture, IP redeemed $192.5 million principal amount of its 11.50% Series mortgage bonds due 2010. The redemption price was equal to $1,115 per $1,000 principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Also in November 2004, IP completed a cash tender offer for $351 million of these bonds. The tender offer consideration paid was $1,214 per $1,000 principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the settlement date. This tender offer satisfied IPs indenture obligation to offer to purchase the bonds resulting from the change of control of IP upon its acquisition by Ameren. In December 2004, IP repurchased an additional $6.5 million principal amount of these bonds at a redemption price of $1,207 per $1000 principal amount plus accrued unpaid interest. At December 31, 2004, only $33,000 principal amount of these bonds remained outstanding.
In December 2004, IP redeemed $66 million principal amount of its 7.50% Series mortgage bonds due 2025 at a redemption price of 103.105% of the principal amount plus accrued interest and $84 million in principal amount of its 7.40% Series 1994 B pollution control bonds due 2024 at a redemption price of 102% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. This indebtedness, along with the redemption and repurchase of the 11.50% Series mortgage bonds due 2010 described above, were funded by IP through equity contributions made by Ameren in the fourth quarter of 2004 totaling $871 million. In conjunction with these debt repurchases, the fair value adjustment on IPs long-term debt was reduced by $103 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.
In December 1998, the IP SPT issued $864 million of TFNs as allowed under the Illinois Electric Utility Transition Funding Law. In accordance with the Transitional Funding Securitization Financing Agreement, IP must designate a portion of the cash received from customer billings to fund payment of the TFNs. The amounts received are remitted to the IP SPT and are restricted for the sole purpose of paying down the TFNs. Due to the adoption of FIN No. 46R and resulting deconsolidation of IP SPT, certain amounts of restricted cash are netted against the current portion of IPs long-term debt payable to IP SPT on IPs December 31, 2004 and 2003, consolidated balance sheets.
In September 1999, IP entered into an operating lease on four gas turbines located in Tilton, Illinois and a separate land lease at the Tilton site. IP sublet the turbines to a predecessor of DMG in October 1999.
In July 2004, subsequent to the expiration of a statutory notice period after a filing at the ICC, IP terminated its lease with the original lessor.
DMG then executed a transfer agreement under which the original lessor sold the turbine assets to DMG for the full contract price of $81 million. Additionally, IP assigned its associated land lease on the Tilton site to a predecessor of DMG. For additional information relating to the Tilton capital lease and related asset retirement obligation liability and remeasurement, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
EEI In June 2004, EEI repaid its $40 million bank term loan at maturity with proceeds received from EEIs credit facilities.
120 In December 2004, EEI repaid $6 million of its 8.60% medium-term notes and $8 million of its 6.61% medium-term notes with proceeds received from EEIs credit facilities.
Indenture Provisions and Other Covenants UE UEs indenture agreements and articles of incorporation include covenants and provisions related to the issuances of first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. For the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds, earnings coverage of twice the annual interest charges on first mortgage bonds outstanding and to be issued is required. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, UE had a coverage ratio of 8.2 times the annual interest charges on the first mortgage bonds outstanding, which would permit UE to issue an additional $3.7 billion of first mortgage bonds at an assumed interest rate of 7%. For the issuance of additional preferred stock, earnings coverage of at least 2.5 times the annual dividend on preferred stock outstanding and to be issued is required under UEs articles of incorporation. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, UE had a coverage ratio of 63 times the annual dividend requirement on preferred stock outstanding, which would permit UE to issue an additional $2 billion in preferred stock at an assumed dividend rate of 7%. The ability to issue such securities in the future will depend on such tests at that time.
In addition, UEs mortgage indenture contains certain provisions that restrict the amount of common dividends that can be paid by UE. Under this mortgage indenture, $31 million of total retained earnings was restricted against payment of common dividends, except those dividends payable in common stock, which left $1.7 billion of free and unrestricted retained earnings at December 31, 2004.
CIPS CIPS indenture agreements and articles of incorporation include covenants that must be complied with before first mortgage bonds and preferred stock are issued. For the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds, earnings coverage of twice the annual interest charges on first mortgage bonds outstanding and to be issued is required, except in certain cases when additional first mortgage bonds are issued on the basis of retired bonds. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, CIPS had a coverage ratio of 3.1 times the annual interest charges for one year on the aggregate amount of bonds outstanding. Consequently, the most restrictive test under the indenture agreements would allow CIPS to issue an additional $134 million of first mortgage bonds, assuming an interest rate of 7%. For the issuance of additional preferred stock, earnings coverage of 1.5 times annual interest charges on all long-term debt and the annual preferred stock dividends is required under CIPS articles of incorporation. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, CIPS had a coverage ratio of 2.1 times the sum of the annual interest charges and dividend requirements on all long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2004, and consequently had the availability to issue an additional $182 million of preferred stock, assuming a dividend rate of 7%. The ability to issue such securities in the future will depend on such coverage ratios at that time.
Genco Gencos senior note indenture includes provisions that require it to maintain a senior debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.75 to 1 (for both the prior four fiscal quarters and for the succeeding four six-month periods) in order to pay dividends or to make payments of principal or interest under certain subordinated indebtedness, excluding amounts payable under its intercompany note payable to CIPS. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, this ratio was 5.0 to 1. In addition, the indenture also restricts Genco from incurring any additional indebtedness, with the exception of certain permitted indebtedness defined in the indenture, unless its senior debt service coverage ratio equals at least 2.5 to 1 for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters and its senior debt to total capital ratio would not exceed 60% - both after giving effect to the additional indebtedness on a pro-forma basis. This debt incurrence restriction is to be disregarded if both Moodys and S&P reaffirm the ratings of Genco in place at the time of debt incurrence after considering the additional indebtedness. As of December 31, 2004, Gencos senior debt to total capital ratio was 53%.
CILCORP Covenants in CILCORP's indenture governing its $475 million (original issuance amount) senior notes and bonds require CILCORP to maintain a debt-to-capital ratio no greater than 0.67 to 1 and an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.2 to 1 in order to make any payment of dividends or intercompany loans to affiliates other than to its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including CILCO. However, in the event CILCORP is not in compliance with these tests, CILCORP may make such payments of dividends or intercompany loans if its senior long-term debt rating is at least BB+ from S&P, Baa2 from Moodys, and BBB from Fitch. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, CILCORP's debt-to-capital ratio was 0.58 to 1 and its interest coverage ratio was 2.3 to 1, calculated in accordance with applicable provisions of this indenture. At December 31, 2004, CILCORPs senior long-term debt ratings from S&P, Moodys, and Fitch were BBB+, Baa2, and BBB+, respectively. The common stock of CILCO is pledged as security to the holders of these senior notes and bonds.
CILCO CILCOs indenture agreement and articles of incorporation include covenants that must be compiled with before CILCO may issue first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. For the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds, an 121 earnings coverage of twice the annual interest requirements on first mortgage bonds outstanding and to be issued, or earnings of at least 12% of the principal amount of all bonds outstanding and to be issued is required, except in certain cases when additional first mortgage bonds are issued on the basis of retired bonds. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, CILCO had an earnings coverage ratio of 7.5 times the annual interest charges for one year on the aggregate amount of bonds outstanding or at least 53% of the principal amount of all mortgage bonds outstanding under the mortgage. Accordingly, the most restrictive test under the indenture agreement would allow CILCO to issue an additional $47 million of first mortgage bonds. For the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock, the articles of incorporation would allow CILCO to issue an additional $47 million of first mortgage bonds. For the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock, the articles of incorporation provide that no class of shares with rights superior to the currently issued preferred stock as to payment of dividends or as to assets shall be issued, unless the net income available for the payment of the dividends for a period of 12 consecutive calendar months within the 15 months immediately preceding the issuance shall be at least 2  times the annual dividend requirements of all then-outstanding shares of preferred stock. Consequently, the most restrictive test under which CILCO could issue additional shares of preferred stock would allow CILCO to issue additional preferred stock in the amount of $155 million.
IP IPs indenture agreements and articles of incorporation include covenants and provisions related to the issuance of first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. For the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds based on property additions, earnings coverage of twice the annual interest charges on first mortgage bonds outstanding and to be issued is required. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, IP had a coverage ratio of 1.88 times the annual interest charges on the first mortgage bonds outstanding, which would not permit IP to issue any additional first mortgage bonds based on property additions. However, as of December 31, 2004, IP had the ability to issue $1.3 billion of bonds based upon retired bond capacity, for which no earnings coverage test is required. For the issuance of additional preferred stock, earnings coverage of at least 1.5 times the annual dividend on preferred stock outstanding and to be issued is required under IPs articles of incorporation. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, IP had a coverage ratio of 1.37 times the annual dividend requirement on preferred stock outstanding, which would not permit IP to issue any additional preferred stock. The ability to issue such securities in the future will depend on such tests at that time.
The IP SPT TFNs contain restrictions that prohibit IP LLC from making any loan or advance to, or certain investments in, any other person. Also, as long as the TFNs are outstanding, the IP SPT shall not, directly or indirectly, pay any dividend or make any distribution (by reduction of capital or otherwise) to any owner of a beneficial interest in the IP SPT.
See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters for restrictions on IPs ability to declare and pay common stock dividends imposed by the ICC order approving Amerens acquisition of IP.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2004, none of the Ameren Companies had any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business. None of the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any significant off-balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future.
NOTE 7 - RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS Ameren and UE recorded a pretax coal contract settlement gain of $51 million in 2003. This gain represented a return of coal costs plus accrued interest accumulated by a coal supplier for reclamation of a coal mine that supplied a UE power plant. UE entered into a settlement agreement with the coal supplier to return the accumulated reclamation funds, which were paid to UE ratably through December 2004.
CILCO recorded $2 million and $21 million in acquisition integration costs in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2004 costs primarily represented severance and relocation amounts. The 2003 costs represented write-offs of software without future benefit as of the acquisition date ($13 million), severance and relocation costs ($5 million), and an increase in the bad debt reserve related to one customer for which there was significant collection concern at the acquisition date ($3 million). These amounts were offset against goodwill at CILCORP through purchase accounting and, therefore, there was no impact to Amerens Consolidated Statement of Income.
Ameren recorded voluntary employee retirement and other restructuring charges of $92 million in 2002. These charges included a voluntary retirement program charge of $75 million based on voluntary retirements of approximately 550 employees. Of the $75 million charge, UE recorded $51 million, CIPS recorded $14 million, Genco recorded $8 million, and other Ameren companies recorded $2 million. These charges related primarily to special termination benefits associated with our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Most of the employees who voluntarily retired accepted retirement in 2002 and left Ameren in early 2003.
In addition, in 2002, Ameren recorded a charge of $17 million primarily associated with the retirement of 343 megawatts of rate-regulated generating capacity at UEs Venice, Illinois plant and temporary suspension of operations of two coal-fired generating units (126 megawatts) at Gencos Meredosia, Illinois plant.

(b) 2002       amounts represent predecessor information. January 2003 predecessor       amounts were zero. CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO       amounts in its balances.
(c) 2003       and 2002 amounts represent predecessor information. January through       September 2004 predecessor miscellaneous income and expense amounts were       $144 million and $1 million, respectively.
NOTE 9 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity and emission credits. Price fluctuations in natural gas, fuel, and electricity cause:  an       unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our firm commitments to       purchase or sell when purchase or sale prices under the firm commitment       are compared with current commodity prices;  market       values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power to differ       from the cost of those commodities in inventory under firm commitment; and  actual       cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities to differ from       anticipated cash outlays.
The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are approved by risk management policies that control the use of forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine if new or offsetting transactions are required. The goal of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements.
Certain derivative contracts are entered into on a regular basis as part of our risk management program but do not qualify for hedge accounting or the normal purchase and sale exceptions under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Accordingly, these contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in the fair value charged or credited to the income statement in the period in which the change occurred. Contracts we enter into as part of our risk management program may be settled financially, by physical delivery, or net settled with the counterparty.
Cash Flow Hedges Our risk management processes identify the relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The mark-to-market value of cash flow hedges will continue to fluctuate with changes in market prices up to contract expiration.
We monitor and value derivative positions daily as part of our risk management processes. We use published sources for pricing when possible to mark positions to market. We rely on modeled valuations only when no other method exists.
The following table presents balances in certain accounts for cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2004 and 2003: Ameren (a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP CILCO 2004: Balance       Sheet: Other       assets $ 35 $ 4 $ 6 $ 6 $ 14 $ 14 Other       deferred credits and liabilities 14 14 - - - - Accumulated       OCI: Power       forwards (b) - - - - - - Interest       rate swaps (c) 4 - - 4 - - Gas       swaps and future contracts (d) 26 4 6 - 11 11 Call       options (e) - - - - - - 2003: Balance       Sheet: Other       assets $ 16 $ 2 $ 1 $ 6 $ - $ 6 Other       deferred credits and liabilities 4 3 - 1 - - 124 Ameren (a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP CILCO Accumulated       OCI: Power       forwards (b) $ 3 $ - $ - $ 3 $ - $ - Interest       rate swaps (c) 5 - - 5 - - Gas       swaps and futures contracts (d) 6 - 1 - - 5 Call       options (e) 2 2 - - - - (a) Excludes       amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004;       excludes amounts for CILCORP prior to the acquisition date of January 31,       2003; and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant       subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.
(b) Represents       the mark-to-market value for the hedged portion of electricity price       exposure for periods generally less than one year. Certain contracts       designated as hedges of electricity price exposure have terms up to three       years.
(c) Represents       a gain associated with interest rate swaps at Genco that were a partial       hedge of the interest rate on debt issued in June 2002. The swaps cover       the first 10 years of debt that has a 30-year maturity and the gain in OCI       is amortized over a 10-year period that began in June   2002.
(d) Represents       a gain associated with natural gas swaps and futures contracts. The swaps       are a partial hedge of our natural gas requirements through March 2008.
(e) Represents       the mark-to-market gain of two call options to purchase coal that are       accounted for as cash flow hedges. One of these options to purchase coal       expired in October 2003 and the other option expires in July 2005.
The pretax net gain or loss on power forward derivative instruments included in Other Income and (Deductions) at Ameren, UE and Genco, which represents the impact of discontinued cash flow hedges, the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges, and the reversal of amounts previously recorded in OCI due to transactions going to delivery or settlement, was less than $1 million loss for Ameren, UE and Genco for the year ended December 31, 2004 (2003 - less than a $1 million loss for Ameren, UE, and Genco).
Other Derivatives The following table represents the net change in market value of option transactions, which are used to manage our positions in SO 2 allowances, coal, heating oil, and electricity or power. Certain of these transactions are treated as nonhedge transactions under SFAS No. 133. The net change in the market value of SO 2 options is recorded in Operating Revenues - Electric, while the net change in the market value of coal, heating oil and electricity or power options is recorded as Operating Expenses - Fuel and Purchased Power.

(c) 2002       amounts represent predecessor information. January 2003 predecessor       amounts were zero.
Through the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been granted FTRs associated with the advent of the MISO Day Two Market. Marketing Company has been granted FTRs for its participation in the PJM-Com Ed market. We sought and received FTRs with the intent to hedge (offset) congestion charges related to our physical electricity business. Depending on the congestion on the transmission grid and prices at various points on the grid, FTRs could result in either charges or credits. We use complex grid modeling tools to determine which FTRs we wish to nominate in the FTR allocation process. There is risk that we may incorrectly model the amount of FTRs we need, and there is the potential that some of the FTR hedges could be ineffective.
125 NOTE 10 - STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN AND PREFERRED STOCK Stockholder Rights Plan Amerens board of directors has adopted a share purchase rights plan designed to assure stockholders of fair and equal treatment in the event of a proposed takeover. The rights are exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15% or more of Amerens outstanding common stock or announces a tender offer, which would result in ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the Ameren common stock. Each right will entitle the holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a newly issued preferred stock at an exercise price of $180. If a person or group acquires 15% or more of Amerens outstanding common stock, each right will entitle its holder (other than such person or members of such group) to purchase, at the rights then-current exercise price, a number of Amerens common shares having a market value of twice such price. In addition, if Ameren is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person or group has acquired 15% or more of Amerens outstanding common stock, each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the rights then-current exercise price, a number of the acquiring companys common shares having a market value of twice such price. The acquiring person or group will not be entitled to exercise these rights. These rights expire in 2008. One right will accompany each new share of Ameren common stock prior to such expiration date.
Preferred Stock All classes of UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs preferred stock are entitled to cumulative dividends and have voting rights. Ameren has 100 million shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock authorized, with no shares outstanding. CIPS has 2.6 million shares of no par value preferred stock authorized, with no shares outstanding. UE has 7.5 million shares authorized of $1 par value preference stock and CILCO has 2 million shares authorized of no par value preference stock, with no such preference stock outstanding. IP has 5 million shares authorized of no par value serial preferred stock and 5 million shares authorized of no par value preference stock, with no such serial preferred stock and preference stock outstanding. No shares of preference stock have been issued by any of the Ameren Companies.
The following table presents the outstanding preferred stock of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP that is not subject to mandatory redemption and is entitled to cumulative dividends and is redeemable, at the option of the issuer, at the prices presented as of December 31, 2004 and 2003: Redemption       Price (per       share) 2004 2003 UE: Without       par value and stated value of $100 per share, 25 million shares       authorized $3.50       Series 130,000       shares $ 110.00 $ 13 $ 13 $3.70       Series 40,000       shares 104.75 4 4 $4.00       Series 150,000       shares 105.625 15 15 $4.30       Series 40,000       shares 105.00 4 4 $4.50       Series 213,595       shares 110.00 (a) 21 21 $4.56       Series 200,000       shares 102.47 20 20 $4.75       Series 20,000 shares 102.176 2 2 $5.50       Series       A 14,000       shares 110.00 1 1 $7.64       Series 330,000       shares 103.82 (b) 33 33 Total $ 113 $ 113 CIPS: With       par value of $100 per share, 2 million shares authorized 4.00%       Series 150,000       shares $ 101.00 $ 15 $ 15 4.25%       Series 50,000       shares 102.00 5 5 4.90%       Series 75,000       shares 102.00 8 8 4.92%       Series 50,000       shares 103.50 5 5 5.16%       Series 50,000       shares 102.00 5 5 6.625%       Series 125,000       shares 100.00 12 12 Total $ 50 $ 50 CILCO: With       par value of $100 per share, 1.5 million shares authorized 4.50%       Series 111,264       shares $ 110.00 $ 11 $ 11 4.64%       Series 79,940       shares 102.00 8 8 Total $ 19 $ 19 126 Redemption       Price (per       share) 2004 2003 IP: (c) With       par value of $50 per share, 5 million shares authorized 4.08%       Series 225,510       shares $ 51.50 $ 12 $ 12 4.20%       Series 143,760       shares 52.00 7 7 4.26%       Series 104,280       shares 51.50 5 5 4.42%       Series 102,190       shares 51.50 5 5 4.70%       Series 145,170       shares 51.50 7 7 7.75%       Series 191,765       shares 50.00 10 10 Total $ 46 $ 46 Less:       IP balances prior to acquisition date - (46) Less:       Shares of IP preferred stock owned by Ameren (d) (33 ) - Total       Ameren $ 195 $ 182 (a) In       the event of voluntary liquidation, $105.50.

The following table presents the outstanding preferred stock of CILCO that is subject to mandatory redemption, is entitled to cumulative dividends and is redeemable, at a determinable price on a fixed date or dates, at the prices presented as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively: Redemption       Price (per       share) 2004 2003 CILCO: (a) Without       par value and stated value of $100 per share, 3.5 million shares       authorized: 5.85%       Series 200,000       shares $ 100.00 (b) ) $ 20 $ 21 (a) Beginning       July 1, 2003, this preferred stock became redeemable, at the option of       CILCO, at $100 per share. A mandatory redemption fund was established on       July 1, 2003. The fund provides for the redemption of 11,000 shares for       $1.1 million on July 1 of each year through July 1, 2007. On July 1, 2008,       the remaining shares outstanding will be retired for $16.5 million.
(b) In       the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, the stockholder       receives $100 per share plus accrued dividends.
NOTE 11 - RETIREMENT BENEFITS We have defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees of UE, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP, EEI and Ameren Services and certain employees of Resources Company and its subsidiaries, including Genco. Ameren uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and postretirement benefit plans.
IP merged into the Ameren pension and postretirement plans during the fourth quarter of 2004. Previously, IP had been part of the Dynegy benefit plans, so the IP predecessor amounts below represent the components of IPs participation in the Dynegy plans prior to Amerens acquisition of IP. Plan participants included not only employees of IP, but certain Illinova and DMG employees. IP was reimbursed by participating Dynegy subsidiaries for their respective shares of the expenses of these benefit plans. Effective with Amerens acquisition of IP, employees of the other Dynegy subsidiaries were not transferred into the Ameren plans and, therefore, are not included in successor information presented.
Investment Strategy and Return on Asset Assumption The primary objective of the Ameren Retirement Plan and postretirement benefit plans is to provide eligible employees with pension and postretirement health care benefits. Ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the prudent investor guidelines contained in the ERISA. Amerens goal is to earn the highest possible return on plan assets consistent with its tolerance for risk. Ameren delegates investment management to specialists in each asset class. Where appropriate, Ameren provides the investment manager with specific guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment types. Ameren regularly monitors manager performance and compliance with investment guidelines.
The expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio. Assumed projected rates of return for each asset class were selected after an analysis of historical experience and future expectations of the returns and the volatility of the various asset classes. Depending on the target asset allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio was adjusted for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared to benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets.
Pension Pension benefits are based on the employees years of service and compensation. Our plans are funded in compliance with income tax regulations and federal funding requirements.
127 The following table presents the cash contributions made to our defined benefit retirement plan qualified trusts during 2004 and 2003. The current-year contribution provided cost savings to us by eliminating the need to pay a portion of insurance premiums to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation.

(b) CILCORP       consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its       balances.
A minimum pension liability was recorded at December 31, 2002, which resulted in an after-tax charge to OCI and a reduction in stockholders equity of $102 million. In 2003, the minimum pension liability was reduced, resulting in OCI of $46 million and an increase in stockholders equity. In 2004, the minimum pension liability was increased, resulting in a charge to OCI of $6 million and a decrease in stockholders equity.

Based on our assumptions at December 31, 2004, we expect to be required under ERISA to fund an aggregate of $400 million for the period of 2005 to 2009, in order to maintain minimum funding levels for our pension plan with no minimum contribution required until 2008, assuming continuation of the current interest rate relief beyond 2005. We expect UEs, CIPS, Gencos, CILCOs, and IPs portion of the future funding requirements to be approximately 50%, 9%, 9%, 11%, and 21%, respectively. These amounts are estimates and may change with actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates, any pertinent changes in government regulations, and any prior voluntary contributions.

Ameren adopted FSP SFAS 106-2 during the second quarter of 2004, retroactive to January 1, 2004, which resulted in the recognition of a federal subsidy for postretirement benefit costs related to prescription drug benefits. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The effect of this subsidy was a reduction of various components of Amerens and principally UEs net periodic postretirement benefit costs. Interest costs were reduced by $4 million and amortization of losses were reduced by $7 million. The impact of the subsidy on the expected return on plan assets was minimal.
UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP are responsible for their proportional share of the postretirement benefit costs.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. In addition, we have plan limits on the amount Ameren will contribute to future postretirement benefits. The following table presents the effects of a 1% change in assumed health care cost trend rates: 1%       Increase 1%       Decrease Ameren: Effect       on net periodic cost $ 3 $ (3 ) Effect       on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 47 (46 ) Other Ameren and CIPS sponsor 401(k) plans for eligible employees. An IP plan was merged into the Ameren plan during the fourth quarter of 2004. The CILCO plan was merged into the Ameren plan at the beginning of 2004. The plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their base pay in accordance with specific guidelines. Ameren, CIPS and IP (predecessor) match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. Amerens and IPs matching contributions to the 401(k) plans totaled $15 million and $2 million (predecessor), respectively, in 2004. Matching contributions to the Ameren, previous IP, and previous CILCO plans were $14 million, $2 million, and $1 million, respectively, in each of the years 2003 and 2002. CIPS matching contributions to its 401(k) plan were less than $1 million annually in 2004, 2003 and 2002.
NOTE 12 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Ameren has a long-term incentive plan for eligible employees called the Long-term Incentive Plan of 1998, which provides for the grant of options, performance awards , restricted stock, dividend equivalents, and stock appreciation rights. Restricted stock awards were granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 as a component of our compensation programs. We applied APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for our stock-based compensation for years prior to 2003. There have not been any stock options granted since December 31, 2000. Effective January 1, 2003, we prospectively adopted accounting for our stock-based compensation plans using the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.
Restricted Stock Restricted stock awards in Ameren common stock may be granted under our long-term incentive plan. Upon the achievement of certain performance levels, the restricted 135 stock award vests over a period of seven years, beginning at the date of grant, and includes provisions requiring certain stock ownership levels based on position and salary. An accelerated vesting provision included in this plan reduces the vesting period from seven years to three years. During 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, 135,340, 152,956, and 154,678 restricted stock awards were granted. The weighted-average fair value for restricted stock awards granted in 2004, 2003, and 2002 was $46.34, $39.74, and $42.50 per share, respectively. We record unearned compensation (as a component of stockholders equity) equal to the market value of the restricted stock on the date of grant and charge the unearned compensation to expense over the vesting period.
Stock Options Ameren Options in Ameren common stock may be granted under our long-term incentive plan at a price not less than the fair-market value of the common shares at the date of grant. Granted options vest over a period of five years , beginning at the date of grant, and provide for accelerated exercising upon the occurrence of certain events, including retirement.

Upon Amerens acquisition of IP, IPs net accumulated deferred income tax liabilities and unamortized accumulated investment tax credits were eliminated. Subsequent to the acquisition, IP began recording new accumulated deferred tax assets and liabilities and had recorded net deferred income tax assets of $65 million as of December 31, 2004.
NOTE 14 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Ameren Companies have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, affiliate transactions in the normal course of business. These transactions primarily consist of gas and power purchases and sales, services received or rendered, and borrowings and lendings. Transactions between affiliates are reported as intercompany transactions on their financial statements, but are eliminated in consolidation for Amerens financial statements. Below are the material related-party agreements.
Electric Power Supply Agreements Under two electric power supply agreements, Genco is obliged to supply to Marketing Company, and Marketing Company, in turn, is obliged to supply to CIPS with all of the energy and capacity CIPS needs to offer service for resale to 139 its native load customers at ICC-related rates and to fulfill its other obligations under all applicable federal and state tariffs or contracts. Any power not used by CIPS is sold by Marketing Company under various long-term wholesale and retail contracts. For native load, CIPS pays an annual capacity charge per megawatt (the greater of its forecasted peak demand or actual demand), plus an energy charge per megawatthour to Marketing Company. For fixed-price retail customers outside of the tariff, CIPS pays Marketing Company the price it receives under these contracts. The fees paid by CIPS to Marketing Company for native load and fixed-price retail customers and any other sales by Marketing Company under various long-term wholesale and retail contracts are passed through to Genco. In addition, under the power supply agreement between Genco and Marketing Company, Genco bears all generation-related operating risks, including plant performance, operations, maintenance, efficiency, employee retention, and other matters. There are no guarantees, bargain purchase options, or other terms that may convey to CIPS the right to use the property and plant of Genco. The expiration date for the agreement between CIPS and Marketing Company has been extended to December 31, 2006. The agreement between Genco and Marketing Company can be terminated by either party upon one years notice. This extension was required by the ICC in its order approving Amerens acquisition of CILCORP and CILCO.
In October 2003, in conjunction with CILCOs transfer to AERG of substantially all of its generating assets, AERG entered into an electric power supply agreement to supply CILCO with sufficient power to meet its native load requirements. CILCO pays a monthly capacity charge per megawatt based on its system capacity requirements, plus an energy charge per megawatthour. The expiration date for this agreement has been extended to December 31, 2006. The ICC required this extension in its order approving Amerens acquisition of CILCORP and CILCO. Also in conjunction with CILCOs generating asset transfer, a bilateral power supply agreement was entered into between AERG and Marketing Company. This agreement provides for AERG to sell excess power to Marketing Company for sales outside the CILCO control area, and it also allows Marketing Company to sell power to AERG to fulfill CILCOs native load requirements.
CILCO had an agreement with CIPS for the purchase of 100 megawatts of capacity and firm energy for the months of January and June through September under a contract that commenced in January 2000 and expired in September 2003. This power was supplied by Genco through the Marketing Company, CIPS, and Genco electric power supply agreements discussed above.
UE, CIPS, IP and a nonaffiliated company are parties to a power supply agreement with EEI to purchase and sell capacity and energy. This agreement expires on December 31, 2005. Under a separate agreement that expires on December 31, 2005, CIPS resold its entitlements under the power supply agreement with EEI to Marketing Company. Marketing Company and certain nonaffiliated companies are parties to a power supply agreement with Midwest Electric Power, Inc., a subsidiary of EEI, to purchase capacity and energy. This agreements term is year to year on a calendar basis unless the purchasing parties unanimously agree to terminate their participation.
UE has a 150-megawatt power supply agreement with Marketing Company that expires December 31, 2005. UE also had a one-year 450-megawatt power supply agreement with Marketing Company that expired in May 2002 and another one-year 200 megawatt power supply agreement with Marketing Company that expired in May 2003. Power supplied by Marketing Company to UE through these agreements is being obtained from Genco.
In December 2003, the SEC approved an agency agreement between AERG and Marketing Company that authorizes Marketing Company, on behalf of AERG, to sell AERGs excess generation or to purchase power needed to supply AERG customers.
In December 2004, Marketing Company and IP entered into an agency agreement that authorizes Marketing Company, on behalf of IP, to sell or purchase, as necessary, electric energy and capacity in the wholesale market for 2005 and 2006.
IP had a contract with a former affiliate, DMG, to supply power via purchase agreements that expired at the end of 2004. The purchased power agreement with DMG obliged DMG to provide power to IP up to the reservation amount, and at the same prices, even if DMG had individual units unavailable at various times.
IP is party to several commercial and industrial electric and gas sales agreements with DMG, which were entered into prior to Amerens acquisition of IP. These are typically yearly contracts that renew automatically unless cancelled by either party pursuant to a 30-day written notice.
Also prior to Amerens acquisition, IP purchased natural gas from Dynegy to serve its gas distribution business under a Gas Industry Standards Board master base contract that terminated October 1, 2004. Under this agreement, IP executed multiple transactions in 2002 and 2003 that covered deliveries for the yearly winter peak season from November through March. One transaction was executed in 2004 to provide deliveries from January to March 2004.
Interconnection and Transmission Agreements UE, CIPS and IP are parties to an interconnection agreement for the use of their respective transmission lines and other facilities for the distribution of power. In addition, CILCO and IP are parties to a similar interconnection agreement. These agreements have no contractual expiration 140 date but may be terminated by either party with three years notice.
IP is party to transmission and interconnection sales agreements withDYPM, a former affiliate,for the use of IPs transmission lines and other facilities. The transmission sale agreements expire in April and June 2005. The interconnection sales agreements expire January 1, 2006. On October 1, 2004, pursuant to the sale of IP to Ameren, all continuing contracts with Dynegy and its affiliates became third-party agreements.
Joint Dispatch Agreement UE and Genco jointly dispatch electric generation under a joint dispatch agreement among UE, Genco and CIPS. Under the agreement, each affiliate is permitted to use the cheapest generation available first, whether it be from UE or Genco. Each affiliate has the option to serve its load requirements from its own generation first, and then to allow access to any available generation to its affiliate. The joint dispatch agreement can be terminated by either party upon one years notice. In an order approving the transfer of UEs Illinois-based utility businesses to CIPS (see Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters), the MoPSC ordered UE to amend the joint dispatch agreement so that margins on short-term power sales will be determined by generation output as opposed to load. This will provide UE with a larger share of the margins on short-term sales of power from the combined generation of UE and Genco. Such an amendment is expected to provide to UE with additional annual margins ranging from $7 million to $24 million for UEs share of short-term power sales. Such an amendment is expected to result in a corresponding reduction in Gencos margins from its share of short-term power sales. However, this reduction is expected to be mitigated by margins received from additional power sales by Genco (through Marketing Company) to CIPS to serve the transferred UE Illinois-based electric utility business through the end of 2006 under the current power supply contracts.
The termination of the joint dispatch agreement, or modifications to it, could have a material effect on Ameren, UE or Genco. Modifications to or termination of the agreement would not have an immediate impact on Ameren because of UEs Missouri electric rate moratorium, which ends June 30, 2006.
Any excess generation not used by UE or Genco through the joint dispatch agreement is sold to third parties through Ameren Energy, serving as each affiliates agent. Ameren Energy also acts as agent on behalf of UE and Genco to purchase power when they require it.
Support Services Agreements Costs of support services provided by Ameren Services, Ameren Energy, and AFS to their affiliates, including wages, employee benefits, professional services, and other expenses are based on, or are an allocation of, actual costs incurred. Effective September 30, 2004, IP was added to the support services agreements with Ameren Services and AFS.
Prior to this, IP operated under Dynegys consolidated groups Services and Facilities Agreement, whereby other Dynegy affiliates exchanged with IP services such as financial, legal, information technology, and human resources, as well as shared facility space. IP services were exchanged at fully distributed costs and revenues were not recorded under this agreement. This agreement was terminated in conjunction with IPs sale to Ameren.
Executory Tolling, Gas Sales, and Transportation Agreements Under an executory tolling agreement, CILCO purchases steam, chilled water, and electricity from Medina Valley. In connection with this agreement, Medina Valley purchases gas to fuel its generating facility from AFS under a fuel supply and services agreement. Prior to September 2003, Medina Valley purchased gas from CILCORP Energy Services, Inc., a subsidiary of CILCORP that operated gas management services including commodity procurement and redelivery to retail customers, and gas transportation from CILCO.
Under a gas transportation agreement, Genco acquires gas transportation service from UE for its Columbia, Missouri CTs. This agreement expires in February 2016.
Notes Receivable from Former Affiliate At December 31, 2004, there was no principal outstanding under IPs $2.3 billion Note Receivable from Former Affiliate, as it was eliminated in connection with the sale of all of IPs common stock and approximately 73% of its preferred stock to Ameren.
Due to the prepayments described below, IP had no accrued interest at December 31, 2004 or 2003.
In July, September, October and December 2003, Dynegy made interest payments totaling $256 million on its $2.3 billion intercompany note payable to Illinova, which in turn made interest payments totaling $256 million to IP under the Note Receivable from Former Affiliate. These interest payments represented accrued interest on the notes for the months of April through December 2003 and prepaid interest for the months of January 2004 through September 2004. In January 2004, IP received an additional interest prepayment of $43 million. These notes contained payment provisions pursuant to which semi-annual interest payments of $86 million were due on April 1 and October 1 of each year. See Note 2 - Acquisitions for further information.
141 Transitional Funding Securitization Financing Agreement IP's financial statements include related-party transactions with the IP SPT, its wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary, which was deconsolidated in accordance with the adoption of FIN No. 46R effective on December 31, 2003.
In accordance with the Transitional Funding Securitization Financing Agreement, IP must designate a portion of the cash received from customer billings to fund payment of the TFNs. The amounts received are remitted to the IP SPT and are restricted for the sole purpose of paying down the TFNs. Due to the adoption of FIN No. 46R and resulting deconsolidation of IP SPT,these amountsare netted against the current portion of IPs long-term debt payable to IP SPT on IPs December 31, 2004 consolidated balance sheet. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.
Money Pools Utility UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP have the ability to borrow from Ameren and from each other through a utility money pool agreement. Ameren Services administers the utility money pool and tracks internal and external funds separately. Ameren Services also participates in the utility money pool. Ameren and AERG may participate in the utility money pool only as lenders. Internal funds are surplus funds contributed to the utility money pool from participants. The primary source of external funds for the utility money pool is the UE commercial paper program. Through the utility money pool, the pool participants can access committed credit facilities at Ameren that totaled $935 million at December 31, 2004. These facilities are in addition to UEs $154 million, CIPS $15 million, and CILCOs $60 million in committed credit facilities, which are also available to the utility money pool participants. Based on outstanding UE commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2004, $789 million was available for borrowing under Ameren credit facilities through the utility money pool agreement. The total amount available to the pool participants from the utility money pool at any given time is reduced by the amount of borrowings by their affiliates, but increased to the extent the pool participants have surplus funds or other external sources are used to increase the available amounts. The availability of funds is also determined by funding requirement limits established by the SEC under the PUHCA. UE, CIPS, CILCO, IP and Ameren Services rely on the utility money pool to coordinate and provide for certain short-term cash and working capital requirements. Borrowers receiving a loan under the utility money pool agreement must repay the principal amount of such loan, together with accrued interest. The rate of interest depends on the composition of internal and external funds in the utility money pool. The average interest rate for borrowing under the utility money pool for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 1.38% (2003 - 1.14%).
On September 30, 2004, in conjunction with the completion on that date of Amerens acquisition of IP, a unilateral borrowing agreement was entered into between Ameren, IP, and Ameren Services that enables IP to make short-term borrowings directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the utility money pool agreement, together with any short-term borrowings by IP, may not exceed $500 million, pursuant to authorization from the ICC and the SEC under the PUHCA. Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration of the agreement. At December 31, 2004, IP had loaned $140 million to the utility money pool.
Non-state-regulated subsidiaries Genco and other non-state-regulated Ameren subsidiaries have the ability to borrow up to $935 million in total from Ameren through a non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool agreement. However, the total amount available to the pool participants at any time is reduced by the amount of borrowings from Ameren by its subsidiaries and is increased to the extent that other pool participants advance surplus funds to the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool or external sources are used to increase the available amounts. At December 31, 2004, $789 million was available through the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool, excluding additional funds available through excess cash balances. The non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool was established to coordinate and provide for short-term cash and working capital requirements of Amerens non-state-regulated activities. It is administered by Ameren Services.
Borrowers receiving a loan under the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool agreement must repay the principal amount of such loan, together with accrued interest.
The rate of interest depends on the composition of internal and external funds in the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool. These rates are based on the cost of funds used for money pool advances. Ameren and CILCORP are authorized to act only as lenders to the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool. In October 2003, AERG received the required regulatory approval necessary to participate in the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool.
The average interest rate for borrowing under the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool for year ended December 31, 2004 was 8.84% (2003 - 8.84%).
CILCORP has been granted authority by the SEC under the PUHCA to borrow up to $250 million directly from Ameren in a separate arrangement unrelated to the money pools. At December 31, 2004, CILCORP had notes payable under this agreement of $72 million (2003 - $46 million) at an average interest rate of 8.84% for the year ended December 31, 2004.
142 Intercompany Promissory Notes As of December 31, 2004, Genco has affiliate notes payable of $249 million and $34 million to CIPS and Ameren, respectively, which, by their current terms, have final payments of principal and interest due on May 1, 2005. These notes bear interest at 7%. In November 2004, Genco made a $75 million principal prepayment under its note payable to CIPS. The note payable toCIPSwas issued in conjunction with thetransfer ofits electric generating assets and related liabilities to Genco. Genco and CIPS plan to renew or modify the CIPS note to extend the principal maturity to May 1, 2010, which is expected to include continued amortization of the principal amount. Genco and Ameren are currently evaluating various alternatives with respect to the note payable to Ameren. In the event the maturities of these notes are not extended or restructured, Genco may need to access other financing sources to meet the maturity obligation to the extent it does nothave cash available from its operating cash flows. Such sources of financing could include borrowings under the non-state-regulated subsidiary money pool, or infusion of equity capital or new direct borrowings from Ameren, all subject to applicable regulatory financing authorizations and provisions in Gencos senior note indenture.
Operating Leases Under an operating lease agreement, Genco is leasing certain CTs at a Joppa, Illinois site to its parent, Development Company for a minimum term of 15 years, expiring September 30, 2015. Under an electric power supply agreement with Marketing Company, Development Company supplies the capacity and energy from these leased units to Marketing Company, which in turn supplies the energy to Genco.
In September 1999, IP entered into an operating lease on four gas turbines located in Tilton, Illinois and a separate land lease at the Tilton site. IP sublet the turbines to its former affiliate, DMG, in October 1999.
In July 2004, subsequent to the expiration of a statutory notice period after a filing at the ICC, IP terminated its lease with the original lessor.
DMG then executed a transfer agreement under which the original lessor sold the turbine assets to DMG for the full contract price of $81 million. Additionally, IP assigned its associated land lease on the Tilton site to DMG. For IP, the Tilton lease was a complete pass-through, with no revenue or expense to IP, as DMG made all of the payments on IP's behalf. The receivable from DMG was offset by a corresponding payable to the lessor. For additional information relating to the Tilton capital lease and related asset retirement obligation liability and remeasurement, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

NOTE 15 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES As a result of issues generated in the course of daily business, we are involved in legal, tax and regulatory proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions, and governmental agencies, some of which involve substantial amounts of money. We believe that the final disposition of these proceedings, except as otherwise disclosed in these notes to our financial statements, will not have an adverse material effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
Capital Expenditures See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters for information regarding Amerens capital expenditure commitment with respect to IP, which was included in the ICC order approving Amerens acquisition of IP, as well as for information regarding Amerens and UEs capital expenditure commitments, which were agreed upon in relation to UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement and UEs 2003 Missouri gas rate case settlement. Additionally, UEs future estimated capital expenditures include the addition of new CTs with approximately 330 megawatts of capacity at its Venice, Illinois plant site by the end of 2005. Total costs expected to be incurred for these units are $125 million, of which $82 million was committed as of December 31, 2004.
Callaway Nuclear Plant The following table presents insurance coverage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant at December 31, 2004: Type       and Source of Coverage Maximum       Coverages Maximum       Assessments for Single Incidents Public       liability: American       Nuclear Insurers $ 300 $ - Pool       participation 10,461 101 (a) $ 10,761 (b) $ 101 Nuclear       worker liability: American       Nuclear Insurers $ 300 (c) $ 4 Property       damage: Nuclear       Electric Insurance Ltd.
$ 2,750 (d) $ 21 Replacement       power: Nuclear       Electric Insurance Ltd.
$ 490 (e) $ 7 (a) Retrospective       premium under the Price-Anderson liability provisions of the Atomic Energy       Act of 1954, as amended (Price-Anderson). This is       subject to retrospective assessment with respect to loss from an incident       at any U.S. reactor, payable at $10 million per year. Price-Anderson       expired in August 2002 and the temporary extension expired December 31,       2003. Until Price-Anderson is renewed, its provisions continue to apply to       existing nuclear plants.
(b) Limit       of liability for each incident under Price-Anderson.
(c) Industry       limit for potential liability from workers claiming exposure to the       hazards of nuclear radiation.
(d) Includes       premature decommissioning costs.
(e) Weekly       indemnity of $4.5 million for 52 weeks, which commences after the first       eight weeks of an outage, plus $3.6 million per week for 71.1 weeks       thereafter.
Price-Anderson limits the liability for claims from an incident involving any licensed U.S. nuclear facility. The limit is based on the number of licensed reactors and is adjusted at least every five years to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. Utilities owning a nuclear reactor cover this exposure through a combination of private insurance and mandatory participation in a financial protection pool, as established by Price-Anderson.
If losses from a nuclear incident at the Callaway nuclear plant exceed the limits of, or are not subject to, insurance, or if coverage is not available, we self-insure the risk. Although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident, if one did occur, it could have a material but indeterminable adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
147 Leases The following table presents our lease obligations at December 31, 2004: Total Less       than 1 Year 1       - 3 Years 3       - 5 Years After       5 Years Ameren: (a) Capital       leases (b) $ 96 $ 3 $ 8 $ 8 $ 77 Operating       leases (c) 208 29 48 28 103 Total       lease obligations $ 304 $ 32 $ 56 $ 36 $ 180 UE: Capital       leases (b) $ 96 $ 3 $ 8 $ 8 $ 77 Operating       leases (c) 119 10 18 17 74 Total       lease obligations $ 215 $ 13 $ 26 $ 25 $ 151 CIPS: Operating       leases (c) $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - Genco: Operating       leases (c) $ 38 $ 2 $ 5 $ 4 $ 27 CILCORP: Operating       leases (c) $ 3 $ 1 $ 2 $ - $ - CILCO: Operating       leases (c) $ 3 $ 1 $ 2 $ - $ - IP: Operating       leases $ 28 $ 7 $ 13 $ 5 $ 3 (a) Includes       amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrantsubsidiaries and       intercompany eliminations.
(b) See       Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings for further discussion.
(c) Amounts       related to certain real estate leases and railroad licenses have       indefinite payment periods. The amounts for these items are included in       the Less than 1 Year, 1 - 3 Years and 3 - 5 Years columns. Amounts for       After 5 Years are not included in the total amount due to the indefinite       periods. Amerens estimated obligation for after five years is $1 million       annually for both the real estate leases and the railroad       licenses.
We lease various facilities, office equipment, plant equipment, and rail cars under operating leases. We also have a capital lease relating to UEs Peno Creek CT facility. We also had a capital lease relating to nuclear fuel for UEs Callaway nuclear plant, which was terminated early in February 2004. See Note 6 - Long-term Debt and Equity Financings for further information on this nuclear fuel lease. In September 1999, IP entered into an operating lease on four gas turbines located in Tilton, Illinois and a separate land lease at the Tilton site. IP sublet the turbines to a predecessor of DMG in October 1999.
In July 2004, subsequent to the expiration of a statutory notice period after a filing at the ICC, IP terminated the lease with the original lessor.
DMG then executed a transfer agreement under which the original lessor sold the turbine assets to DMG for the full contract price of $81 million. Additionally, IP assigned its associated land lease on the Tilton site to DMG. The following table presents total rental expense, included in Other Operations and Maintenance expenses, as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 Ameren (a) $ 21 $ 61 $ 21 UE 25 59 24 CIPS 8 9 10 Genco 2 2 2 CILCORP (b) 5 5 5 CILCO 5 5 5 IP (c) 5 6 7 (a) Excludes       amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004;       excludes amounts for CILCORP and CILCO prior to the acquisition date of       January 31, 2003; and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and       non-Registrant subsidiaries and intercompany   eliminations.

148 Other Obligations To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of our generating plants, we have entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of coal, natural gas, and nuclear fuel. In addition, we have entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase of electricity and natural gas for distribution. The following table presents the total estimated fuel, power purchase, and natural gas commitments at December 31, 2004: Coal Gas Nuclear Electric       Capacity (c) Total Ameren: (a) 2005 $ 702 $ 478 $ 11 $ 167 $ 1,358 2006 671 249 9 167 1,096 2007 535 100 1 23 659 2008 409 43 10 23 485 2009 223 13 9 1 246 Thereafter (b) 36 16 - - 52 Total $ 2,576 $ 899 $ 40 $ 381 $ 3,896 UE: 2005 $ 361 $ 77 $ 11 $ 49 $ 498 2006 335 40 9 22 406 2007 264 15 1 22 302 2008 189 5 10 22 226 2009 83 2 9 - 94 Thereafter (b) 18 2 - - 20 Total $ 1,250 $ 141 $ 40 $ 115 $ 1,546 CIPS: 2005 $ - $ 81 $ - $ 122 $ 203 2006 - 55 - 122 177 2007 - 22 - - 22 2008 - 3 - - 3 2009 - - - - - Thereafter (b) - - - - - Total $ - $ 161 $ - $ 244 $ 405 Genco: 2005 $ 191 $ 18 $ - $ - $ 209 2006 175 14 - - 189 2007 165 5 - - 170 2008 143 3 - - 146 2009 105 2 - - 107 Thereafter (b) 10 3 - - 13 Total $ 789 $ 45 $ - $ - $ 834 CILCORP: (d) 2005 $ 71 $ 156 $ - $ 5 $ 232 2006 82 95 - 5 182 2007 44 51 - 5 100 2008 32 26 - 5 63 2009 14 5 - 5 24 Thereafter (b) 3 - - - 3 Total $ 246 $ 333 $ - $ 25 $ 604 CILCO: 2005 $ 71 $ 156 $ - $ 5 $ 232 2006 82 95 - 5 182 2007 44 51 - 5 100 2008 32 26 - 5 63 2009 14 5 - 5 24 Thereafter (b) 3 - - - 3 Total $ 246 $ 333 $ - $ 25 $ 604 IP: 2005 $ - $ 126 $ - $ 155 $ 281 2006 - 40 - 144 184 2007 - 6 - - 6 2008 - 4 - - 4 2009 - 4 - - 4 Thereafter (b) - 11 - - 11 Total $ - $ 191 $ - $ 299 $ 490 (a) Includes       amounts for Ameren Registrant and non-Registrant subsidiaries and       intercompany eliminations.

(d) CILCORP       consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO in its       amounts.
149 IP paid the $5 million in remaining decommissioning obligations associated with its former Clinton nuclear plant in December 2004. Other obligations also include decontamination and decommissioning charges associated with IPs use of a DOE facility that enriched uranium for the Clinton nuclear plant. IP was assessed an amount to be paid over 15 years that would be used by the DOE for decontamination and decommissioning of its facility. The remaining obligation is $2 million and the final payment is due in 2006.
Environmental Matters We are subject to various environmental regulations by federal, state and local authorities. From the beginning phases of siting and development to the ongoing operation of existing or new electric generating, transmission and distribution facilities, and natural gas storage plant, transmission and distribution facilities, our activities involve compliance with diverse laws and regulations. These address noise, emissions, and impacts to air and water, protected and cultural resources (such as wetlands, endangered species, and archeological/historical resources), chemical and waste handling. Our activities often require complex and often lengthy processes as we obtain approvals, permits or licenses for new, existing or modified facilities. Additionally, the use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials (including wastes) requires preparation of release prevention plans and emergency response procedures. As new laws or regulations are promulgated, we assess their applicability and implement the necessary modifications to our facilities or their operations, as required. The more significant matters are discussed below.
Clean Air Act The EPA issued a rule in October 1998 that required 22 eastern states and the District of Columbia to reduce emissions of NO x in order to reduce ozone in the eastern United States. Among other things, the EPAs rule establishes an ozone season, which runs from May through September, and a NO x emission budget for each state, including Illinois. The EPA rule required states to implement controls sufficient to meet their NO x budget by May 31, 2004. In the spring of 2004, the EPA issued similar rules for Missouri. The compliance date for the Missouri rules is May 1, 2007.
As a result of these requirements, affected Ameren Companies have installed a variety of NO x control technologies on power plant boilers over the past several years. Amerens and UEs future estimated capital expenditures to comply with the final NO x regulations in Missouri between 2005 and 2008 are $15 million to $20 million.
In mid-December 2003, the EPA issued proposed regulations with respect to SO 2 and NO x emissions (the Clean Air Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The new rules, if adopted, will require significant additional reductions in these emissions from UE, Genco and CILCO power plants in phases, beginning in 2010. The rules are currently under a public review and comment period; they may change before being issued as final. We do not expect regulations to be finalized until the first half of 2005. The following table presents preliminary estimated capital costs based on current available technology to comply with the Clean Air Interstate Rule and mercury rules, as proposed: 2005 2006       - 2009 2010       - 2015 Total Ameren $ 50 $ 510       - $ 1,360 $       355 - $       1,130 $       1,400 -$ 1,900 UE 20 160 - 880 175 - 880 840 - 1,140 Genco 10 250 - 340 140 - 200 400 - 550 CILCO 20 100 - 140 40 - 50 160 - 210 IP and DMG are the subject of a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA and a complaint filed in 1999 by the United States in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois (Court) alleging violations of the Clean Air Act and certain related federal and Illinois regulations. Similar notices and complaints were filed against other owners of coal-fired power plants in what we refer to as the Utility Enforcement Initiative. Both the NOV and the complaint allege that certain equipment repairs, replacements, and maintenance activities at the three Baldwin Power Station generating units, currently owned by DMG and formerly owned by IP, constituted major modifications under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations, the New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) regulations and the applicable Illinois regulations. It is further alleged that the defendants failed to obtain required operating permits under the applicable Illinois regulations. When activities meeting the definition of major modifications occur, the Clean Air Act and related regulations generally subject those activities to PSD review and permit requirements; the generating facilities where the activities occur must meet more stringent emissions standards, which may entail the installation of potentially costly pollution control equipment.
Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement covering Amerens acquisition of IP from Dynegy, Dynegy agreed to fully indemnify Ameren and IP in the event of an adverse ruling and in any settlement arising from or out of this litigation. To secure payment of the indemnification obligations 150 of Dynegy, Ameren, pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, has deposited $100 million of the cash portion of the purchase price into an escrow account with the funds to be released to Dynegy on the sooner of (1) December 31, 2010; (2) the date on which the senior unsecured debt of Dynegy Holdings Inc., a Dynegy subsidiary, achieves an investment grade rating from S&P or Moodys; or (3) the occurrence of specified events relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with IPs former generating facilities, including the Baldwin Power Station.
DMG has entered into a comprehensive settlement with the EPA, the U.S. and other intervening parties that resolves this litigation. The settlement agreement is set forth in a consent decree and resolves all claims in the litigation as well as similar claims that may have been brought with respect to other generation facilities owned by DMG and formerly owed by IP. If approved by the Court, this consent decree will relieve IP of any civil liability under the Clear Air Act and related federal and Illinois regulations with respect to IP's former ownership of the Baldwin Power Station and other generation assets now owned by DMG. The consent decree, upon its approval by the Court, is also expected to satisfy the conditions for the release to Dynegy of the $100 million of the IP purchase price that is held in an escrow account as discussed above.
Multipollutant Legislation The United States Congress has been working on legislation to consolidate the numerous air pollution regulations facing the utility industry. Continued deliberation on this Clear Skies legislation is expected in 2005. Our cost to comply with such legislation, if it is enacted, is expected to be covered by the modifications to our facilities required by combined mercury and Clean Air Interstate rules described above.
Global Climate Future initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global warming are the subjects of much debate. As a result of our diverse fuel portfolio, our contribution to greenhouse gases varies. Coal-fired power plants, however, are significant sources of carbon dioxide emissions, a principal greenhouse gas. The related Kyoto Protocol was signed by the United States but has since been rejected by the president, who instead has asked for an 18% decrease in carbon intensity on a voluntary basis. In response to the administrations request, six electric power sector trade associations, including the Edison Electric Institute, of which Ameren is a member, and the Tennessee Valley Authority signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the DOE in December 2004 calling for a 3% - 5% decrease in carbon intensity from the utility sector between 2002 and 2012 on a voluntary basis. Currently, Ameren is considering various initiatives to comply with the MOU, including enhanced generation at our nuclear and hydro power plants, increased efficiency measures at our coal-fired units, and investments in renewable energy and carbon sequestration projects.
Ameren has already taken actions to address the global climate issue. These include implementing efficiency improvements at our power plants; participating in the PowerTree Carbon Company, LLC, whose purpose is to reforest acreage in the lower Mississippi valley to sequester carbon; using coal combustion by-products as a direct replacement for cement, thereby reducing carbon emissions at cement kilns; participating in "Missouri Schools Going Solar," a project that will install photovoltaic solar arrays on school grounds; and partnering with other utilities, the Electric Power Research Institute, and the Illinois Geological Survey in the DOE Illinois Basin Initiative, which will examine methods and the feasibility of storing carbon dioxide within deep, uneconomic coal seams, mature oil fields, and saline reservoirs.
Future initiatives related to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming and the ultimate effects of the Kyoto Protocol on us are unknown. Although compliance costs are unlikely in the near future, our costs of complying with any mandated federal greenhouse gas program could have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
Clean Water Act In July 2004, the EPA issued rules under the Clean Water Act that require that cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. These rules pertain to existing generating facilities that currently employ a cooling water intake structure whose flow exceeds 50 million gallons per day. The rules may require us to install additional intake screens or other protective measures, and to do extensive site-specific study and monitoring. There is also the possibility that the rules may lead to the installation of cooling towers on some of our facilities. Our compliance costs associated with conducting field studies and installing fish collection systems to determine the aquatic impact of our intake structures will be in the range of a few million dollars over the next few years. These studies will determine what, if any, additional technology must be applied at nine of our existing power plants. At this time, we are unable to estimate the costs of complying with these rules. Such costs will not be incurred prior to 2008.
151 Remediation We are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous waste sites as required by federal and state law. Such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal, or ownership of a disposal site. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP have each been identified by the federal or state governments as a potentially responsible party at several contaminated sites. Several of these sites involve facilities that were transferred by CIPS to Genco in May 2000 and were transferred by CILCO to AERG in October 2003. As part of each transfer, the transferor (CIPS or CILCO) has contractually agreed to indemnify the transferee (Genco or AERG) for remediation costs associated with preexisting environmental contamination at the transferred sites.
UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP own or are otherwise responsible for one, 13, four, and 25 former MGP sites, respectively, in Illinois. All of these sites are in various stages of investigation, evaluation and remediation. Under its current schedule, Ameren anticipates that remediation at these sites should be completed by 2015. The ICC permits each company to recover remediation and litigation costs associated with their former MGP sites located in Illinois from their Illinois electric and natural gas utility customers through environmental adjustment rate riders. To be recoverable, such costs must be prudently and properly incurred; costs are subject to annual reconciliation review by the ICC. The total costs deferred, net of recoveries from insurers and through environmental adjustment rate riders, at December 31, 2004, were $1 million, $25 million, $4 million, and $64 million for UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP, respectively.
In addition, UE owns or is otherwise responsible for 10 MGP sites in Missouri and one in Iowa. Unlike Illinois, UE does not have in effect in Missouri a rate rider mechanism which permits remediation costs associated with MGP sites to be recovered from utility customers. UE does not have any retail utility operations in Iowa. Because of the unknown and unique characteristics of each site (such as amount and type of residues present, physical characteristics of the site and the environmental risk), and uncertain regulatory requirements, we are not able to determine the maximum liability for the remediation of these sites. UE has recorded a $16 million liability as of December 31, 2004, to represent its estimated minimum obligation. At this time, we are unable to determine what portion of these costs, if any, will be eligible for recovery from insurance carriers.
In June 2000, the EPA notified UE and numerous other companies that former landfills and lagoons in Sauget, Illinois, may contain soil and groundwater contamination. These sites are known as Sauget Area 1 and Sauget Area 2. From approximately 1926 until 1976, UE operated a power generating facility adjacent to Sauget Area 2; UE currently owns and operates electric transmission and distribution facilities in or near Sauget Areas 1 and 2.
In September 2000, the DOJ was granted leave by the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Illinois to add numerous additional parties, including UE, to a pre-existing lawsuit between the government and others. The government seeks recovery of response costs under CERCLA (Superfund), incurred in connection with the remediation of Sauget Area 1. In October 2003, the government dismissed UE as a party to the lawsuit. UE considers the Sauget Area 1 litigation closed.
In September 2001, the EPA proposed in the Federal Register that Sauget Area 1 and Sauget Area 2 be listed on the National Priorities List. The inclusion of a site on this list allows the EPA to access Superfund trust monies to fund site remediations. With respect to Sauget Area 2 and under the terms of an Administrative Order and Consent, UE has joined with other potentially responsible parties to evaluate the extent of potential contamination. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Sauget Area 2 site on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
In October 2002, UE was included in a Unilateral Administrative Order list of potentially liable parties for groundwater contamination for a portion of the Sauget Area 2 site. The Unilateral Administrative Order encompasses the groundwater contamination releasing to the Mississippi River adjacent to Monsanto Chemical Companys (now known as Solutia) former chemical waste landfill and the resulting impact area in the Mississippi River. UE is being asked to participate in response activities that involve the installation of a barrier wall around a chemical waste site with three recovery wells to divert groundwater flow. The projected cost for this remedy method is $26 million. In November 2002, UE sent a letter to the EPA asserting its defenses to the Unilateral Administrative Order and requested its removal from the list of potentially responsible parties under the Unilateral Administrative Order. Solutia agreed to comply with the Unilateral Administrative Order. However, in December 2003, Solutia filed for bankruptcy protection; it is now seeking to discharge its environmental liabilities. In March 2004, Pharmacia Corporation, the former parent company of Solutia, confirmed its intent to comply with the EPAs Unilateral Administrative Order. As the status of future remediation at Sauget Area 2 or compliance with the Unilateral Administrative Order is uncertain, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Sauget Area 2 site on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. In December 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court in the case Cooper Industries, Inc. vs. Availl Services Inc. limited the circumstances under which potentially responsible parties could assert cost-recovery claims against other potentially responsible parties. As a result of this ruling, UE may not be able to recover from other potentially responsible parties the costs it incurs in complying with EPA orders.
152 In October 2002, CILCO submitted a corrective action plan to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (Illinois EPA) in accordance with permit conditions to address groundwater issues associated with the recycle pond and ash ponds at the Duck Creek power plant facility. In January 2003, the Illinois EPA accepted portions of the plan but rejected other portions. Additional discussions with the Illinois EPA will be necessary to develop an acceptable plan. CILCORP and CILCO both have a liability of $5 million at December 31, 2004, included on their Consolidated Balance Sheets for the estimated cost of the remediation effort to treat and discharge the recycle system water in order to address these groundwater issues. Future CILCO capital expenditures at Duck Creek will include construction of a dry fly ash collection system, a landfill, and a new pond. CILCO estimates that future capital expenditures for the indicated activities could be approximately $15 million by 2008.
In addition, our operations or those of our predecessor companies, involve the use, disposal and, in appropriate circumstances, the cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws. We are unable to determine the impact these actions may have on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
Waste Disposal On July 30, 2002, the Illinois Attorney Generals Office advised us that it would be commencing an enforcement action concerning an inactive waste disposal site near Coffeen, Illinois. This is the location of a disposal facility that is permitted by the Illinois EPA to receive fly ash from Gencos Coffeen power plant. The Illinois Attorney General also notified the disposal facilitys current and former owners about the proposed enforcement action. The Attorney Generals Office advised us that it may initiate an action under CERCLA (Superfund) to recover past costs incurred at the site ($0.3 million) and to obtain a declaratory judgment as to liability for future costs. Neither Genco, the current owner of the Coffeen power plant, nor CIPS, the prior owner of the Coffeen power plant, owned or operated the disposal facility. We do not expect that this matter will have a material adverse effect on Amerens, CIPS' or Gencos results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
Emission Credits Both federal and state laws require significant reductions in SO 2 and NO x emissions from burning fossil fuels. The Clean Air Act and NO x Budget Trading Program created marketable commodities called allowances. Each allowance gives the owner the right to emit one ton of SO 2 or NO x . All existing generating facilities have been allocated allowances that are based on past production and the statutory emission reduction goals. UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI have recorded these allowances at no cost. If additional allowances are needed for new generating facilities, they can be purchased from facilities having excess allowances or from allowance banks. Our generating facilities comply with the SO 2 limits through the use and purchase of allowances, the use of low-sulfur fuels, or the application of pollution control technology. The NO x Budget Trading Program limits emissions of NO x during the ozone season (May through September). The NO x Budget Trading Program applies to all electric generating units in Illinois beginning in 2004 and in the eastern third of Missouri, where UEs coal-fired power plants are located, beginning in 2007. Our generating facilities are expected to comply with the NO x limits through the use and purchase of allowances or through the application of pollution control technology, including low NO x burners, over-fire air systems, combustion optimization, and selective catalytic reduction systems.
As of December 31 2004, UE, Genco, CILCO, and EEI held 1.6 million, 0.4 million, 0.2 million, and 0.3 million tons, respectively, of SO 2 emission allowances with vintages from 2004 to 2012. Each company possesses additional allowances for use in periods beyond 2012. As of December 31, 2004, UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI Illinois facilities held 290, 22,400, 6,300 and 8,600 tons, respectively, of NO X emission allowances with vintages from 2004 to 2007. The Illinois EPA is still determining some NO x emission allowance allocations for this period and 2008. UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI expect to use a substantial portion of the SO 2 and NO x allowances for ongoing operations. Allocations of NO x allowances for Missouri facilities are pending the finalization of rules by Missouri regulators. New environmental regulations, including the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the timing of the installation of pollution control equipment, and level of operations will have a significant impact on the amount of allowances actually required for ongoing operations.
Asbestos-Related Litigation Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been named, along with numerous other parties, in a number of lawsuits that have been filed by certain plaintiffs claiming varying degrees of injury from asbestos exposure. Most have been filed in the Circuit Court of Madison County, Illinois. The number of total defendants named in each case is significant; as many as 235 parties are named in some cases and as few as five in others. However, the average number of parties is 61 in the cases that were pending as of December 31, 2004.
The claims filed against Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP allege injury from asbestos exposure during the plaintiffs activities at our present or former electric generating plants. Former CIPS plants are now owned by Genco, and most former CILCO plants are now owned by AERG. Most of IPs plants were transferred to a Dynegy subsidiary prior to Amerens acquisition of IP. As a part of the transfer of ownership of the CIPS and CILCO generating plants, the transferor (CIPS or CILCO) has contractually agreed to 153 indemnify the transferee (Genco or AERG) for liabilities associated with asbestos-related claims arising from activities prior to the transfer. Each lawsuit seeks unspecified damages in excess of $50,000, which, if proved, typically would be shared among the named defendants.
From September 30, 2004, through December 31, 2004, 24 additional asbestos-related lawsuits were filed against UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP, mostly in the Circuit Court of Madison County, Illinois; three lawsuits were dismissed and one was settled. The following table presents the status as of December 31, 2004, of the asbestos-related lawsuits that have been filed against the Ameren Companies: Specifically       Named as Defendant Total (a) Ameren UE CIPS Genco CILCO IP Filed 266 22 145 99 2 19 114 Settled 57 - 35 20 - 2 26 Dismissed 100 9 60 29 - 3 45 Pending 109 13 50 50 2 14 43 (a) Addition       of the numbers in the individual columns does not equal the total column       because some of the lawsuits name multiple Ameren entities as defendants.
In January 2005, UE filed suit in the Circuit Court of Madison County, Illinois, alleging that four of its historic liability insurers have failed to pay more than $2 million in fees and costs relating to the defense and investigation of more than 120 asbestos lawsuits filed against UE. The defendant insurers are American Automobile Insurance Co., Pacific Insurance Co., Royal Insurance Co. of America and Royal Indemnity Co. These insurers insured UE from the late 1940s through the early 1970s for liability arising out of the work of independent contractors working at UEs facilities. We are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit.
As of December 31, 2004, five asbestos-related lawsuits were pending against EEI. The general liability insurance maintained by EEI provides coverage with respect to liabilities arising from asbestos-related claims.
The Ameren Companies believe that the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters - IP and EEI Acquisition for information on the ICCs approval of a tariff rider through which asbestos-related litigation claims will be allowed to be recovered from IPs electric customers, subject to certain terms, commencing in 2007.
Other Matters Enron Litigation Settlement In May 2001, CILCO and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI), a subsidiary of Enron Corporation (Enron), entered into a master agreement for electric purchases and sales, which covered energy transactions scheduled for deliveries during the period of 2001 to 2003. In November 2001, EPMI demanded that CILCO post $28 million in collateral based on mark-to-market exposure of open transactions. Also in November 2001, CILCO notified EPMI that events of default had occurred under the master agreement. Therefore, pursuant to the termination provisions of the master agreement it declared the master agreement terminated effective December 20, 2001. Enron and EPMI filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions in December 2001 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. In December 2002, EPMI filed a complaint against AES, Constellation New Energy, Inc., formerly known as AES New Energy Inc., and CILCO in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court seeking $31 million. As a result of court-ordered mediation of this matter, a settlement agreement was reached among the parties and approved by the Bankruptcy Court on September 30, 2004. This settlement agreement and court order settled the outstanding claims by requiring CILCO to pay $20.9 million to an Enron subsidiary. This settlement payment was made during October 2004. The payment also settled an unrelated dispute between CILCO and another Enron subsidiary, Enron North America Corporation (ENA), over ENAs failure to deliver natural gas to CILCO pursuant to transactions entered into in May and October 2001. AES, in conjunction with its sale of CILCORP to Ameren in 2003, agreed to indemnify Ameren against the after-tax cost of all liabilities, which includes the settlement payment, legal fees, and expenses incurred by CILCO relating to the Enron claim. Ameren assigned its indemnification rights to CILCO. The indemnification payment from AES to CILCO also took place in October 2004. As a result of the income tax treatment afforded the settlement and related indemnification, this settlement had no earnings impact on Ameren, CILCORP or CILCO.
Retiree Medical Plan Litigation In June 2003, 20 retirees and surviving spouses of retirees of various Ameren companies (the plaintiffs) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Illinois, against Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco and Ameren Services, and against our Retiree Medical Plan and by an amended complaint, our Group Medical Plan (the defendants). The retirees were members of various local labor unions of the IBEW and the IUOE. The complaint, referred to as Barnett et al. vs. Ameren Corporation, et al., alleged, among other things, that the defendants recent actions relating to requiring retirees to pay a portion of their own health care premiums or 154 increasing the premiums paid by dependents or surviving spouses of retirees violate the ERISA and Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 and constitute a breach of the defendants fiduciary duties.
In July 2004, the District Court denied the plaintiffs motion to certify this lawsuit as a class action and in September 2004, the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals denied the plaintiffs application to appeal the District Courts decision. In January 2005, the District Court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment, which dismisses the plaintiffs complaint against the defendants with prejudice. In February 2005, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the District Courts ruling with the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. We do not believe the final resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
IP Litigation Kemerer vs. IP was brought against IP in the Circuit Court of Mercer County, Illinois, by the wife of a man who died in 2000 when he backed his aluminum ladder into overhead power lines and was electrocuted. In the lawsuit, the plaintiff sought to recover on allegations of wrongful death (including lost wages and pain and suffering), negligent infliction of emotional distress (to the decedents wife), and punitive damages. The case was tried before a jury in January 2004, and the jury awarded the plaintiff $1.6 million in actual damages and $3 million in punitive damages. In January 2005, IP entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff resolving all outstanding matters; the terms of the settlement are confidential. This settlement will not have a material adverse effect upon IPs results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
Another case involved plaintiffs Lucash and Johnson, who were killed in an automobile accident in February 2001 when their car struck an IP guy wire and utility pole and caught fire. The plaintiffs families filed lawsuits against IP in the Circuit Court of Madison County, Illinois, which asserted wrongful death and survivorship causes of action alleging that IP failed to properly maintain its electrical equipment and did not have authority for the location of the pole. The lawsuit sought unspecified damages in excess of $50,000. In February 2005, IP entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs that resolved all outstanding matters; the terms of those settlements are confidential. Those settlements will not have a material adverse effect upon IPs results of operation, financial position, or liquidity.
Leveraged Leases Ameren owns interests in assets that have been financed as leveraged leases. One of these leveraged leases is a $10 million investment at December 31, 2004, in an aircraft leased to Delta Air Lines. Delta Air Lines reported significant operating losses and disclosed in its Form 10-Q filing for the three months ended September 30, 2004, that these results are unsustainable and underscore the urgent need to reduce its cost structure. Ameren could lose all or a portion of its investment in the Delta Air Lines lease in the event of a bankruptcy or default by Delta Air Lines or any voluntary restructuring of the lease. As of December 31, 2004, Delta Air Lines was current on its payments on this lease.
Regulation Regulatory changes enacted and being considered at the federal and state levels continue to change the structure of the utility industry and utility regulation, as well as to encourage increased competition. At this time, we are unable to predict the impact of these changes on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters for further information.
NOTE 16 - CALLAWAY NUCLEAR PLANT Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is responsible for the permanent storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE currently charges one mill, or 1 / 10 of one cent, per nuclear-generated kilowatthour sold for future disposal of spent fuel. Pursuant to this act, UE collects one mill from its electric customers for each kilowatthour of electricity that it generates from its Callaway nuclear plant. Electric utility rates charged to customers provide for recovery of such costs. The DOE is not expected to have its permanent storage facility for spent fuel available until at least 2010. UE has sufficient storage capacity at its Callaway nuclear plant until 2020. It has the capability for additional storage capacity through the licensed life of the plant. The delayed availability of the DOEs disposal facility is not expected to adversely affect the continued operation of the Callaway nuclear plant through its currently licensed life.
Electric utility rates charged to customers provide for the recovery of the Callaway nuclear plants decommissioning costs, which include decontamination, dismantling, and site restoration costs, over an assumed 40-year life of the plant, ending with the expiration of the plants operating license in 2024. The Callaway nuclear plant site is assumed to be decommissioned based on immediate dismantlement method and removal from service. Ameren and UE have recorded an asset retirement obligation for the Callaway nuclear plant decommissioning costs at fair value, which represents the present value of estimated future cash outflows. See the discussion of SFAS No.143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Decommissioning costs are charged to cost of services used to establish electric rates for UEs customers. These costs amounted to $7 million in each of the years 2004, 2003 and 2002. Every three years, the MoPSC and ICC 155 require UE to file updated cost studies for decommissioning its Callaway nuclear plant. Electric rates may be adjusted at such times to reflect changed estimates.
The latest studies were filed in 2002; updated cost studies are expected to be filed in September 2005.
Costs collected from customers are deposited in an external trust fund to provide for the Callaway nuclear plants decommissioning. If the assumed return on trust assets is not earned, we believe that it is probable that any such earnings deficiency will be recovered in rates. The fair value of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund for UEs Callaway nuclear plant is reported in Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund in Amerens and UEs Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount is legally restricted. It may be used only to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. Changes in the fair value of the trust fund are recorded as an increase or decrease to the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and to the regulatory asset recorded in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 143. Upon the completion of UEs transfer of its Illinois electric and gas utility businesses to CIPS, which is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals, the assets and liabilities related to the Illinois portion of the decommissioning trust fund will be transferred to Missouri. See Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters for further information.
NOTE 17 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value: Cash, Temporary Investments and Short-term Borrowings The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
Marketable Securities The fair value is based on quoted market prices obtained from dealers or investment managers.
Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund The fair-value estimate is based on quoted market prices for securities.
Preferred Stock of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP The fair-value estimate is based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues.
Long-term Debt The fair-value estimate is based on the quoted market prices for same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Ameren Companies for debt of comparable maturities.
Derivative Financial Instruments Market prices used to determine fair value are primarily based on published indices and closing exchange prices. In addition, valuations must also rely on managements estimates, which take into account time value of money and volatility factors.
The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial instruments at December 31, 2004 and 2003: 2004 2003 Carrying       Amount Fair       Value Carrying       Amount Fair       Value Ameren: (a) Long-term       debt and capital lease obligations (including current     portion) $ 5,444 $ 5,747 $ 4,568 $ 4,903 Preferred       stock 215 176 203 186 UE: Long-term       debt and capital lease obligations (including current     portion) $ 2,062 $ 2,107 $ 2,102 $ 2,117 Preferred       stock 113 95 113 110 CIPS: Long-term       debt (including current portion) $ 450 $ 483 $ 485 $ 539 Preferred       stock 50 34 50 39 Genco: Long-term       debt (including current portion) $ 698 $ 836 $ 698 $ 832 CILCORP: (b) Long-term       debt (including current portion) $ 639 $ 708 $ 769 $ 827 Preferred       stock 39 36 40 37 CILCO: Long-term       debt (including current portion) $ 138 $ 143 $ 238 $ 256 Preferred       stock 39 36 40 37 IP: (c) Long-term       debt (including current portion) $ 1,134 $ 1,138 $ 1,925 $ 2,105 Preferred       stock 46 37 46 44 (a) Excludes       amounts for IP for 2003; and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and       non-Registrant subsidiaries and intercompany   eliminations.

156 UE has investments in debt and equity securities that are held in trust funds for the purpose of funding the nuclear decommissioning of its Callaway nuclear plant. See Note 16 - Callaway Nuclear Plant for further information. We have classified these investments in debt and equity securities as available for sale and have recorded all such investments at their fair market value at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Investments by the nuclear decommissioning trust fund are allocated 60% to 70% to equity securities, with the balance invested in fixed-income securities. Fixed-income investments are limited to U.S. government or agency securities, municipal bonds, or investment-grade corporate securities. The proceeds from the sale of investments were $131 million in 2004 (2003 - $123 million; 2002 - $141 million). Using the specific identification method to determine cost, the gross realized gains on those sales were $1 million for 2004 (2003 - $1 million; 2002 - less than $1 million). Net realized and unrealized gains and losses are reflected in regulatory assets on Amerens and UEs Consolidated Balance Sheets. This reporting is consistent with the method we use to account for the decommissioning costs recovered in rates. Gains or losses on assets in the trust fund could result in lower or higher funding requirements for decommissioning costs, which we believe would be reflected in electric rates paid by UEs customers.
The following table presents the costs and fair values of investments in debt and equity securities in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund at December 31, 2004, and 2003: Security       Type Cost Gross       Unrealized Gain Gross       Unrealized Loss Fair       Value 2004: Debt       securities $ 65 $ 2 $ - $ 67 Equity       securities 99 65 7 157 Cash       equivalents 11 - - 11 Total $ 175 $ 67 $ 7 $ 235 2003: Debt       securities $ 62 $ 2 $ - $ 64 Equity       securities 96 56 9 143 Cash       equivalents 5 - - 5 Total $ 163 $ 58 $ 9 $ 212 The following table presents the costs and fair values of investments in debt securities according to their contractual maturities at December 31, 2004: Cost Fair       Value Less       than 5       years $ 26 $ 26 5       years to 10 years 21 22 Due       after 10 years 18 19 Total $ 65 $ 67 NOTE 18 - SEGMENT INFORMATION Amerens reportable segment Utility Operations comprises its electric generation and electric and gas transmission and distribution operations.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.
None.
15 9 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Only Ameren as an accelerated filer, with respect to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act was required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations as to managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the 2004 fiscal year. UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP are not accelerated filers and were not required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations as to managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the 2004 fiscal year.
(a) Evaluation       of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December 31, 2004, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each of the Ameren Companies have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of such Registrants disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each of the Ameren Companies have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to any material information relating to such Registrant that is required in such Registrants reports filed or submitted to the SEC under the Exchange Act.
(b) Managements       Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules13a - 15(f) and 15d - 15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation ofmanagement, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation was conducted of the effectiveness of Amerens internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation under the framework in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by the COSO , management concluded that Amerens internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2004. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of Amerens internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report herein under Part II, Item 8.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management has excluded IP from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, because it was acquired by Ameren in a purchase business combination on September 30, 2004. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Amerens independent registered public accounting firm, also excluded IP from its audit of internal control over financial reporting. IP is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameren whose total assets and total revenues represented 18% and 7%, respectively, of Amerens consolidated financial statement amounts as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2004.
(c) Change       in Internal Controls There has been no change in the Ameren Companies internal control over financial reporting during their most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, their internal control over financial reporting, except for the modification of certain of the internal controls of IP to make them consistent with the internal controls of the other Ameren Companies, and the application of Amerens existing controls to include the operations of IP.
ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION.
The Ameren Companies have no information reportable under this item that is required to be disclosed in a report on SEC Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of 2004, which has not previously been reported on an SEC Form 8-K.
160 PART III ITEM 10. DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANTS.
Information required by Items 401 and 405 of SEC Regulation S-K for Ameren will be included in its definitive proxy statement for its 2005 annual meeting of shareholders filed pursuant to SEC Regulation 14A and is incorporated herein by reference. Information required by these SEC Regulation S-K items for UE, CIPS and CILCO will be included in each companys definitive information statement for its 2005 annual meetings of shareholders filed pursuant to Regulation 14C and is incorporated herein by reference. With respect to Genco and CILCORP, this information is omitted in reliance on General Instruction I(2) of Form 10-K. Information required by SEC Regulation S-K Items 401 and 405 for IP is set forth at the conclusion of this Item 10.
Information concerning executive officers of the Ameren Companies required by Item 401 of SEC Regulation S-K is reported under a separate caption entitled Executive Officers of the Registrants in Part I of this report.
As controlled companies of their ultimate parent, Ameren, as defined by the NYSE listing standards, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP do not have separately designated standing audit committees of their own, but instead use Amerens Audit Committee to perform such committee functions for their boards of directors as permitted under exemptions provided in the NYSE listing standards. Harvey Saligman serves as chairman of Amerens Audit Committee and Richard A. Liddy, Richard A. Lumpkin, Paul L. Miller Jr., and Douglas R. Oberhelman serve as members. The board of directors of Ameren has determined that it has one Audit Committee financial expert serving on its Audit Committee. He is Douglas R. Oberhelman, and he has been determined by Amerens board of directors to be independent as that term is used in SEC Regulation 14A.
Also in accordance with exemptions provided under the NYSE listing standards, the boards of directors of UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP use the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of Amerens board to perform such committee functions. This committee is responsible for the nomination of directors and corporate governance practices. Amerens Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director nominations from shareholders in accordance with its Policy Regarding Nominations of Directors, which can be found on Amerens Internet Web site ( http://www.ameren.com ). This policy became applicable to IP upon its acquisition by Ameren on September 30, 2004.
To provide for ethical conduct in its financial management and reporting, Ameren has adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, the principal accounting officer and controller, and the treasurer of the Ameren Companies. Ameren has also adopted a Code of Business Conduct that applies to the directors, officers and employees of the Ameren Companies, referred to as the Corporate Compliance Policy. The Ameren Companies make available free of charge through Amerens Internet site ( http://www.ameren.com) the Code of Ethics and Corporate Compliance Policy. These documents are also available without charge in print upon written request to Ameren Corporation, Attention: Secretary, P.O. Box 66149, St.Louis, Missouri 63166-6149. Any amendment to, or waiver of, the Code of Ethics and Corporate Compliance Policy will be posted on Amerens Internet site within five business dates following the date of the amendment or waiver.
Information Concerning IPs Directors as Required by Item 401 of SEC Regulation S-K The current members of IPs board of directors are Warner L. Baxter, Scott A. Cisel, Daniel F. Cole, Gary L. Rainwater, Steven R. Sullivan, Thomas R. Voss, and David A. Whiteley, each of whom is an executive officer of IP or an affiliate. For each directors age as of December 31, 2004, and business background for at least the last five years, refer to Executive Officers of the Registrants in Part I of this report. All of the directors were initially electedby directors upon Amerens acquisition of IP in September 2004, except for Cisel, who was elected by the directors to fill a vacancy on the board in October 2004. All of these directors have been nominated by Amerens Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for re-election to IPs Board at its annual meeting of shareholders to be held on April 26, 2005, to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their respective successors have been duly elected and qualified. Each nominee has consented to being nominated for director and has agreed to serve if elected. No arrangement or understanding exists between any nominee and IP or, to IPs knowledge, any other person or persons pursuant to which any nominee was or is to be selected as a director or nominee. There are no family relationships among any directors, executive officers, or people nominated or chosen by IP to become directors or executive officers. See Item 13 under Part III of this report for certain reportable family relationships with nonexecutive officers. IP has been informed that Ameren intends to cast the votes of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of IP for the election of the nominees for directors named above. Accordingly, all the nominees are expected to be re-elected.
161 Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance (for IP as Required by Item 405 of SEC Regulation S-K) Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, as amended, requires IPs directors and executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of IPs common stock to file with the SEC and the NYSE reports of their ownership in IPs preferred stock, and, in some cases, of its ultimate parents common stock, and of changes in that ownership. SEC regulations also require IP to identify in this report any person subject to this requirement who failed to file any such report on a timely basis. Based solely on a review of the filed reports and written representations that no other reports are required, each of IPs directors and executive officers complied with all such filing requirements during 2004.

(b) Amounts for each fiscal year represent bonus compensation earned for that year payable in the subsequent year.
(c) Restricted stock awards relate to Ameren common stock. This column is based on the closing market price of Ameren common stock on the date the restricted stock was awarded (for 2004, $46.34 per share on February 13, 2004 ; for 2003, $39.74 per share on February 14, 2003; and for 2002, $42.50 per share on February 8, 2002). The aggregate number of restricted shares of Ameren common stock held at December 31, 2004 and the value of such holdings, based on the number of restricted shares for which restrictions have not l apsed times the closing market price at December 31, 2004 ($50.14 per share), was 41,329 shares and $2,072,236 for Rainwater; 20,118 shares and $1,008,717 for Baxter; 13,245 shares and $664,104 for Voss; 13,343 shares and $669,018 for Cole; and 12,332 shares and $618,326 for Sullivan. Restricted shares have the potential to vest equally over a seven-year period from date of grant (one-seventh on each anniversary date) based upon the achievement of certain Ameren performance levels and upon the achievement of required stock ownership levels based on position and salary (ownership levels range from three to five times salary). The vesting period is reduced from seven years to three years if Amerens ongoing earnings per share achieve a prescribed growth rate over the three-year period. Restricted stock that would otherwise vest remain restricted until prescribed minimum stock ownership levels are satisfied by the IP Named Executive Officer. Upon the occurrence of a change in control as defined in Ameren's Long-Term Incentive Plan of 1998, all restrictions and vesting requirements with respect to the restricted stock terminate. Dividends paid on restricted shares are reinvested in additional shares of Ameren common stock, which vest concurrently with the restricted shares. The IP Named Executive Officers are entitled to voting privileges associated with the restricted shares to the extent the restricted shares have not been forfeited.
(d) Options relate to Ameren common stock, except with respect to Altenbaumer, whose options were granted under a Dynegy plan in Dynegy common stock.
(e) For the IP Named Executive Officers, amounts include matching contributions to Amerens 401(k) plan, the dollar value of insurance premiums paid by Ameren with respect to term life insurance, and above-market earnings on deferred compensation. See "Arrangements with IP Named Executive Officers - Deferred Compensation Plans" below. For fiscal year 2004, earnings on deferred compensation were not above market as defined by SEC rules. For fiscal year 2004, the amount includes (1)matching contributions to Amerens 401(k) plan and (2) the dollar value of insurance premiums paid by Ameren with respect to term life insurance as follows: (1) (2) G.L. Rainwater $ 9,851 $ 11,122 W.L. Baxter 10,480 1,688 T.R. Voss 9,358 4,832 D.F. Cole 9,788 2,584 S.R. Sullivan 6,808 1,355 (f) Effective January 1, 2005, Voss was elected executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ameren in addition to his other named positions.
(g) Altenbaumer served as president of IP until his retirement effective April 1, 2004. All compensation presented for Altenbaumer in this table relates to compensation paid prior to Amerens acquisition of IP based on Dynegys policy. His 2003 bonus amount and $350,000 of his 2004 All Other Compensation were paid pursuant to his severance agreement and release entered into with Dynegy and IP in January 2004 in connection with his resignation from IP and Dynegy, which is described under Employment Contracts and Change-In-Control Arrangements in Part III, Item 11. Executive Compensation, of IPs 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The balance of Altenbaumers 2004 All Other Compensation consisted of $40,385 as payment for banked vacation earned in 2000 and $4,213 in matching contributions to IPs 401(k) plan.
(h) Young is an executive officer of Dynegy who succeeded Altenbaumer as president of IP from April 1, 2004, until the completion of Amerens acquisition of IP on September30, 2004. Young was not compensated by IP for serving as its president. He was compensated by Dynegy for services rendered in all capacities to Dynegy and its affiliates, including IP. Information with respect toYoungs compensation for 2004 is expected to be reported in Dynegys definitive proxy statement for its 2005 annual meeting of shareholders, andhis compensation for 2003 and 2002 was reported in Dynegys definitive proxy statement for its 2004 annual meeting of shareholders, neither of which shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference into this report and for which the Ameren Companies accept no responsibility.

(b) These columns represent the excess of the closing price of Amerens common stock of $50.14 per share, as of December 31, 2004, above the exercise price of the options. The amounts under the Exercisable column report the value of options that are vested and therefore could be exercised. The Unexercisable column reports the value of options that are not vested and therefore could not be exercised as of December 31, 2004. There is no guarantee that, if and when these options are exercised, they will have this value.
Upon the occurrence of a change in control as defined in Ameren's Long-Term Incentive Plan of 1998, all options become vested and immediately exercisable.
Ameren Retirement Plan (as it applies to the IP Named Executive Officers) Most salaried employees of Ameren and its subsidiaries, including the IP Named Executive Officers, earn benefits under the Ameren Retirement Plan immediately upon employment. Benefits generally become vested after five years of service. On an annual basis a bookkeeping account in a participants name is credited with an amount equal to a percentage of the participants pensionable earnings for the year. Pensionable earnings include base pay, overtime and annual bonuses, which are equivalent to amounts shown as Annual Compensation in the Summary Compensation Table above. The applicable percentage is based on the participants age as of December 31 of that year. If the participant was an employee prior to July 1, 1998, an additional transition credit percentage is credited to the participants account through 2007 (or an earlier date if the participant had less than 10 years of service on December 31, 1998).
Participants       Age on December 31 Regular       Credit for Pensionable Earnings (a) Transition       Credit Pensionable Earnings Total       Credits Less       than 30 3% 1% 4% 30       to 34 4% 1% 5% 35       to 39 4% 2% 6% 40       to 44 5% 3% 8% 45       to 49 6% 4.5% 10.5% 50       to 54 7% 4% 11% 55       and over 8% 3% 11% (a) An       additional regular credit of 3% is received for pensionable earnings above       the Social Security wage base.
These accounts also receive interest credits based on the average yield for one-year U.S. Treasury Bills for the previous October, plus 1%. The minimum interest credit is 5%. In addition, certain annuity benefits earned by participants under prior plans as of December 31, 1997, were converted to additional credit balances under the Ameren Retirement Plan as of January 1, 1998. Effective January 1, 2001, an Enhancement Account was added that provides a $500 additional credit at the end of each year. When a participant terminates employment, the amount credited to the participants account is converted to an annuity or paid to the participant in a lump sum. The participant can also choose to defer distribution, in which case the account balance is credited with interest at the applicable rate until the future date of distribution. Benefits are not subject to any deduction for Social Security or other offset amounts.
In certain cases, pension benefits under the Retirement Plan are reduced to comply with maximum limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. A Supplemental Retirement Plan is maintained by Ameren to provide for a supplemental benefit equal to the difference between the benefit that would have been paid if such Code limitations were not in effect and the reduced benefit payable as a result of such Code limitations. The plan is unfunded and is not a qualified plan under the Internal Revenue Code.
164 The following table shows the estimated annual retirement benefits, including supplemental benefits, payable to each IP Named Executive Officer listed if he were to retire at age 65. These estimates use total compensation through December 31, 2004, and project his 2005 base salary to retirement, excluding bonuses. The estimates show payments made in the form of a single life annuity.
Name Year       of 65th Birthday Estimated       Annual Benefit G.L.       Rainwater 2011 $ 203,000 W.       .L. Baxter 2026 183,000 T.R.       Voss 2012 142,000 D.F.

Sullivan 2025 168,000 Compensation of IP Directors Directors who are employees or directors of Ameren or any of its subsidiaries receive no additional compensation for their services as IP directors. All directors of IP are executive officers of Ameren or its subsidiaries.
Arrangements with IP Named Executive Officers Change of Control Severance Plan Under the Ameren Corporation Change of Control Severance Plan, designated officers of Ameren and its subsidiaries, including the IP Named Executive Officers, are entitled to receive severance benefits if their employment is terminated under certain circumstances within three years after a change of control. A change of control occurs, in general, if (1) any individual, entity or group acquires 20% or more of the outstanding Common Stock of Ameren or of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of Ameren; (2) individuals who, as of the effective date of the plan, constitute the board of directors of Ameren, or who have been approved by a majority of the board, cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the board; (3) Ameren enters into certain business combinations, unless certain requirements are met regarding continuing ownership of the outstanding common stock and voting securities of Ameren and the membership of its board of directors; or (4) approval by Ameren shareholders of a complete liquidation or dissolution of Ameren.
Severance benefits are based upon a severance period of two or three years, depending on the officers position. An officer entitled to severance will receive a cash lump sum equal to the following: (1)salary and unpaid vacation pay through the date of termination; (2) a pro rata bonus for the year of termination, and base salary and bonus for the severance period; (3) continued employee welfare benefits for the severance period; (4) a cash payment equal to the actuarial value of the additional benefits the officer would have received under Amerens qualified and supplemental retirement plans if employed for the severance period; (5) up to $30,000 for the cost of outplacement services; and (6) reimbursement for any excise tax imposed on such benefits as excess payments under the Internal Revenue Code.
Deferred Compensation Plans Under the Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan and its Executive Incentive Compensation Program Elective Deferral Provisions, executive officers and certain key employees, including the IP Named Executive Officers, may choose to defer up to 30% of their salary and 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of their bonus. All of the IP Named Executive Officers have deferred amounts under one or both of the plans. The minimum amount of salary that can be deferred in any calendar year is $3,500 and the minimum amount of bonus thatcan be annually deferred is $2,000. Deferred amounts under both plans earn interest at 150% of the average Mergent's Seasoned AAA Corporate Bond Yield Index (Mergents Index, formerly called Moodys Index) until the participant retires or attains 65 years of age. After the participant retires, attains 65 years of age, or dies, the deferred amounts under the plans earn the average Mergent's Index rate. For 2004, the average Mergents Index rate was 5.67%, 150% of that was 8.51%. A participant may choose to receive the deferred amounts at retirement in a lump sum payment or in installments over a set period, up to 15 years with respect to deferred salary and 10 years with respect to deferred bonus. If a participant revokes the deferral election under either plan, deferred amounts will be distributed in a lump sum with all interest credited to the deferral account forfeited. In the event a participant terminates employment with Ameren prior to attaining retirement age and after the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in such plans), the balance in such participants deferral account, including interest payable at 150% of the average Mergents Index is distributable in a lump sum to the participant within 30 days of the date the participant terminates employment.
165 Severance Agreement and Consulting Agreement with Former IP President In January 2004, prior to Amerens acquisition of IP, Dynegy and IP entered into a severance agreement and release and a consulting agreement with Larry F. Altenbaumer, then president of IP. These agreements are described under Employment Contracts and Change-In-Control Arrangements in Part III, Item 11, Executive Compensation, of IPs 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The members of the Human Resources Committee of the Ameren board of directorsperformed compensation-related committee functions for IP for the fourth quarter of the 2004 fiscal year after Amerens acquisition of IP. Its members during this period were Gordon R. Lohman, Thomas A. Hays, Richard A. Liddy, and John Peters MacCarthy. No member of this committee was at any time during this part of the 2004 fiscal year or at any other time an officer or employee of Ameren or IP, and no member had any relationship with Ameren or IP requiring disclosure under applicable SEC rules. No executive officer of Ameren or IP has served on the board of directors or compensation committee of any other entity that has or has had one or more executive officers who served as a member of Amerens or IPs board of directors or Amerens Human Resources Committee during the 2004 fiscal year. Prior to Amerens acquisition of IP, the members of Dynegys compensation committee performed committee functions for IP. There are no matters relating to interlocks or insider participation during this period that IP is required to report.

166 Securities of IP All 23 million outstanding shares of IPs common stock and 662,924 shares, or approximately 73%, of IPs preferred stock were acquired by Ameren from Dynegy and its subsidiaries on September 30, 2004, and are owned by Ameren as of the date of this report. This acquisition resulted in a change in control of IP. IP is now a subsidiary of Ameren.
None of IPs outstanding shares of preferred stock were owned by directors, nominees for director, or executive officers of IP as of February 1, 2005. To our knowledge, other than Ameren, which as noted above owns 73% of IPs outstanding preferred stock, there are no beneficial owners of 5% or more of IPs outstanding shares of preferred stock as of February 1, 2005, but no independent inquiry has been made to determine whether any shareholder is the beneficial owner of shares not registered in the name of such shareholder or whether any shareholder is a member of a shareholder group.
Securities of Ameren (As Applicable to IP) The following table sets forth certain information known to IP with respect to beneficial ownership of Ameren common stock as of February 1, 2005, for (1) each director and nominee for director of IP, (2) the IP Named Executive Officers, and (3) all executive officers, directors, and nominees for director as a group.
