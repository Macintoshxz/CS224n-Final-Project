3 Denbury Resources Inc.                                       PART I  ITEM 1. BUSINESS ----------------  WEBSITE ACCESS TO REPORTS       We make our  annual  report on Form 10-K,  quarterly  reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant  to  section  13(a)  or 15(d) of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934 available free of charge on or through our internet website, www.denbury.com, as soon as reasonably  practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.  THE COMPANY       Denbury Resources Inc. is a Delaware corporation,  organized under Delaware General  Corporation  Law  ("DGCL")  engaged  in the  acquisition,  development, operation and  exploration  of oil and natural gas  properties in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and the Barnett Shale in Texas. Our corporate  headquarters is located at 5100 Tennyson Parkway, Suite  3000,  Plano,  Texas  75024,  and our phone  number is  972-673-2000.  At December 31, 2004,  we had 380  employees,  243 of which were  employed in field operations  or at the field  offices.  Our  employee  count does not include the approximately  200 employees of Genesis Energy,  Inc. as of December 31, 2004 as its employees  exclusively carry out the business  activities of Genesis Energy, L.P., which we do not consolidate in our financial statements (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  INCORPORATION AND ORGANIZATION       Denbury was originally incorporated in Canada in 1951. In 1992, we acquired all of the shares of a United States operating company, Denbury Management, Inc. ("DMI"),  and subsequent to the merger we sold all of its Canadian assets. Since that time, all of our operations have been in the United States.       In April 1999, our stockholders  approved a move of our corporate  domicile from Canada to the United States as a Delaware corporation. Along with the move, our wholly  owned  subsidiary,  DMI,  was merged  into the new  Delaware  parent company, Denbury Resources Inc. This move of domicile did not have any effect on our operations or assets.       Effective  December 29, 2003,  Denbury Resources Inc. changed its corporate structure  to a holding  company  format.  The  purposes of creating the holding company structure were to better reflect the operating  practices and methods of Denbury,  to improve its economics,  and to provide greater  administrative  and operational  flexibility.  As part of this  restructure,  Denbury Resources Inc. (predecessor  entity) merged into a newly formed limited liability company,  and survived as, Denbury Onshore,  LLC, a Delaware limited  liability company and an indirect subsidiary of the newly formed holding company,  Denbury Holdings, Inc. Denbury Holdings, Inc. subsequently assumed the name Denbury Resources Inc. (new entity).  The  reorganization  was  structured as a tax free  reorganization  to Denbury's  stockholders and all outstanding capital stock of the original public company was  automatically  converted  into the identical  number of and type of shares of the new public holding company.  Stockholders'  ownership interests in the business did not change as a result of the new  structure  and shares of the Company remain publicly traded under the same symbol (DNR) on the New York Stock Exchange.  The new  parent  holding  company is  co-obligor  (or  guarantor,  as appropriate)  regarding  the payment of  principal  and  interest  on  Denbury's outstanding debt securities.  BUSINESS STRATEGY       As part of our corporate strategy,  we believe in the following fundamental principles:       o    remain focused in specific regions;                                         4 Denbury Resources Inc.       o    acquire  properties  where we believe  additional value can be created           through a combination of  exploitation,  development,  exploration and           marketing, including secondary and tertiary operations;       o    acquire  properties  that  give us a  majority  working  interest  and           operational control or where we believe we can ultimately obtain it;       o    maximize the value of our  properties  by  increasing  production  and           reserves while reducing cost; and       o    maintain a highly  competitive  team of experienced  and  incentivized           personnel.  ACQUISITIONS       Information as to recent  acquisitions  and  divestitures by Denbury is set forth  under  Note  2,  "Acquisitions  and  Divestitures,"  to the  Consolidated Financial Statements.  OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS  Our CO2 Assets       Just  over  five  years  ago,  we  started  a new  focus  area  through  an acquisition of a carbon dioxide ("CO2")  tertiary flood in an area very familiar to us, Mississippi.  We have subsequently  acquired other related assets and are making that focus area the major part of our business. We particularly like this tertiary play as (i) it is lower risk and more predictable than most traditional exploration  and development  activities,  (ii) it provides a reasonable rate of return at  relatively  low oil prices (low to mid  twenties),  and (iii) we have virtually  no  competition  for this type of activity in our current  geographic area. Generally,  from East Texas to Florida, there are no known natural sources of carbon  dioxide  except our own,  and these large  volumes of CO2 that we own drive the play.  Our CO2 comes  from an old  underground  volcano  located  near Jackson, Mississippi,  discovered in the 1960s while companies were drilling for oil and natural gas.  These CO2 reserves  are found in  structural  traps in the Haynesville,  Buckner,  Smackover  and  Norphlet  formations  at depths of about 16,000 feet.       CO2 injection is one of the most efficient tertiary recovery mechanisms for producing crude oil;  however,  because it requires large quantities of CO2, its use has been  restricted to West Texas,  Mississippi  and other  isolated  areas where large quantities of CO2 are available.  The CO2 (in liquid form) acts as a type of  solvent  for the oil,  causing  the oil to expand  and  become  mobile, allowing the oil to be recovered  along with the CO2 as it is produced.  The CO2 is then  extracted  from the oil,  compressed  back  into a  liquid  state,  and re-injected into the reservoir,  with this recycling  process  occurring several times during the life of the tertiary  operations.  In a typical oil field up to 50%  of  the  oil in  place  can  be  extracted  during  primary  and  secondary (waterflooding)  recovery  operations.  Through  the  use  of  CO2  in  tertiary operations,  it is possible to recover additional oil (for example, 17% based on historical results at Little Creek),  almost as much oil as initially  recovered during the primary production phase.       We  started  this  play in  August  1999,  when we  acquired  our first CO2 tertiary  recovery  project,  Little  Creek  Field  in  Mississippi,  a  project originally developed by Shell Oil Company.  Since our acquisition of this field, we have increased oil  production  here from 1,350 Bbls/d to an average of 2,989 Bbls/d during the fourth quarter of 2004. Following our success at Little Creek, we embarked upon a strategic  program to build a dominant position in this niche play.  We  recognized  that  several  other  fields  in the area  would  also be excellent  CO2  flood  candidates  because  they  produced  from the same  Lower Tuscaloosa formation,  shared very similar reservoir characteristics and were in close  proximity to each other.  Following are highlights of our activities over the last three years:       o    In  February  2001,  we  acquired  approximately  800  Bcf  of  proved           producing  CO2 reserves  for $42.0  million,  a purchase  that gave us           control of most of the CO2 supply in Mississippi, as well as ownership           and control of a critical  183-mile  CO2  pipeline.  This  acquisition                                         5 Denbury Resources Inc.            provided  the  platform  to  significantly  expand  our  CO2  tertiary           recovery  operations because it assured us that CO2 would be available           to us on a reliable  basis and at a reasonable and  predictable  cost.           Since February 2001, we have acquired two and drilled seven additional           CO2  producing  wells,  more than  tripling our  estimated  proved CO2           reserves  to  approximately  2.7  Tcf as of  December  31,  2004.  The           estimate of 2.7 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves is based on 100%  ownership           of the CO2 reserves, of which Denbury's net ownership is approximately           2.1 Tcf and is  included  in the  evaluation  of proven  CO2  reserves           prepared  by  DeGolyer &  MacNaughton  and  included as Exhibit 99. In           discussing the available CO2 reserves,  we make reference to the gross           amount of proved  reserves,  as this is the amount  that is  available           both for Denbury's tertiary recovery programs and for industrial users           who are customers of Denbury and others, as Denbury is responsible for           distributing  the  entire  CO2  production  stream  for both of these.           Today,  we own every  producing  CO2 well in the region.  Although our           current proven and potential CO2 reserves are quite large, in order to           continue  our  tertiary   development  of  oil  fields  in  the  area,           incremental  deliverability  of CO2 is needed.  In order to obtain the           additional CO2 deliverability, we plan to drill several additional CO2           wells in the future, including up to four more wells during 2005.       o    During  2001 and  2002,  we  acquired  several  oil  fields in our CO2           operating  area,  including  the West  Mallalieu  and  McComb  Fields.           Typical of mature  properties in this area, the  acquisition  costs of           both of  these  fields  were  relatively  low in  comparison  to their           significant  reserve  potential as tertiary recovery  projects.  As an           example,  we  acquired  West  Mallalieu  Field  in May  2001  for $4.0           million,  and by  year-end  2001 had  recognized  10.4 MMBOE of proved           reserves,  with additional  future reserve potential in this field. We           acquired  McComb Field in 2002 for $2.3 million,  and by year-end 2002           had recognized  8.3 MMBOE of proved  reserves with  additional  future           reserve potential here also.       o    In August 2002, we acquired  COHO Energy Inc.'s Gulf Coast  properties           for  $48.2  million,   which  included   Brookhaven   Field,   another           significant  tertiary flood candidate along our CO2 pipeline.  Initial           development of the Brookhaven CO2 flood began in late 2004. DeGolyer &           MacNaughton  has  estimated  that 18.7 MMBbls of oil  reserves  can be           recovered from  Brookhaven  field from our CO2 tertiary  operations in           their December 31, 2004 proved reserve report.       o    During the fourth  quarter of 2004, we sold an average of 69 MMcf/d of           CO2 to  commercial  users and we used an average of 149 MMcf/d for our           tertiary   activities.   We  estimate   that  our  current  daily  CO2           deliverability  is approximately  350 MMcf/d,  and by year-end 2005 we           hope to further increase our CO2  deliverability to between 450 MMcf/d           and 500  MMcf/d.  We plan to  continue  our CO2  drilling  in 2005 and           beyond,  as we estimate that we will need up to 700 MMcf/d in the next           few years in order to meet the  projected  timetable  for our tertiary           projects in Southwest and East  Mississippi.  During 2004,  two of the           CO2 wells we drilled  tested new  structures  that  increased  our CO2           reserves by  approximately  1 Tcf of CO2.  These wells will be brought           online once we install the  facilities  that are  necessary to produce           these  wells at their  maximum  rates.  With the  increase  in our CO2           deliverability  and  reserves,  we  made  the  strategic  decision  to           commence  with  installation  of a  pipeline  to  several  of our East           Mississippi properties, and expect to commence CO2 operations in three           East  Mississippi  fields by mid-2006.  As of December  31, 2004,  the           calculated  present value of the remaining  industrial sales contracts           (using pricing  provided in the contracts)  discounted at 10% per year           was  approximately  $26.5  million  based on the current  life of each           contract.       o    In October 2003 and September  2004, we sold 167.5 Bcf and 33.0 Bcf of           CO2 to Genesis for $24.9  million and $4.8 million  under two separate           volumetric  production  payments.  In  conjunction  with the sale,  we           included the assignment of four of our existing  long-term  commercial           CO2 supply agreements with our industrial  customers.  Pursuant to the           terms of the  volumetric  production  payments,  Genesis has  specific           maximums  on the  amount of CO2 they are  allowed  to take each  year,           which  generally  relate  to  the  anticipated  volumes  of  the  four           industrial  customers.  We provide Genesis with certain processing and           transportation  services in connection with these agreements for a fee           of  approximately  $0.16 per Mcf of CO2 delivered to their  industrial           customers.       o    During the fourth  quarter of 2004, we commenced  operations to expand           our  tertiary  program  to East  Mississippi  and have  commenced  the                                         6 Denbury Resources Inc.            acquisition  of leases and  right-of-way  for the  construction  of an           84-mile CO2 pipeline from our source wells near  Jackson,  Mississippi           to Eucutta Field in East  Mississippi.  We believe that this expansion           into East Mississippi, labeled Phase II, has significant oil potential           beyond the first six fields that we have engineered and plan to flood.           Combining the production forecast for both of these areas (Phase I and           II) extends the period  during  which we  anticipate  significant  oil           production  growth from a few years, for Phase I alone, to five to ten           years combined. While it is extremely difficult to accurately forecast           future production, we do believe that our tertiary recovery operations           provide   significant   long-term   production   growth  potential  at           reasonable rates of return,  with relatively low risk, and will be the           backbone of our Company's growth for the foreseeable future.       With anticipated  all-in finding and development  costs  (including  future development  and  abandonment  costs)  of around  $6.00 per BOE and  anticipated operating  costs of  around  $10.00  per BOE over  the life of each  field,  our tertiary  recovery  operations  in West  Mississippi  along our pipeline  should provide a reasonable  rate of return at oil prices in the low twenties,  as they produce light sweet oil that receives near NYMEX pricing.  The economics will be a little  different in East  Mississippi  (Phase II) in the following  ways: (i) operating  costs in East  Mississippi  are likely to be one to three dollars per BOE  higher  than it is for  those  fields  along  our  existing  CO2  pipeline, primarily  because of the incremental  cost of transporting  the CO2 to this new area  (assuming  another  party  ultimately  owns  the  pipeline  and  we  pay a throughput or  transportation  fee), (ii) the incremental  operating cost may be partially offset by an anticipated lower finding cost, as these East Mississippi fields may not require as many wells to be drilled or re-entered,  as more wells are currently  active,  (iii) there are  reservoir  related  differences,  which although not exactly  quantified,  are expected to improve the overall economics in the eastern  area,  and (iv) the quality of the oil is  different  in the two areas.  In the  eastern  part of the state,  the oil is  generally  heavier  and usually  sour,  and thus has a higher  negative  differential  to NYMEX  prices, ranging  historically  from  one to six  dollars  per  barrel  lower  than  West Mississippi   light  sweet  oil.   During  the  fourth   quarter  of  2004,  the differentials  for these  heavier  crudes  widened  to as much as $13 to $16 per barrel,  but we expect the  differentials to return to their  historical  levels over time. In summary,  while the fields in West Mississippi  along our pipeline provide a  satisfactory  rate of return at NYMEX oil prices in the low twenties, we project that it takes NYMEX oil prices in the mid to high twenties to achieve similar rates of return in East Mississippi.       Tentatively,  we plan to spend  approximately  $35  million  in 2005 in the Jackson Dome area targeted to add additional CO2 reserves and deliverability for future operations. Approximately $60 million in capital expenditures is budgeted in 2005 for our oil fields with tertiary operations in Southwest Mississippi and approximately $50 million for oil fields in East Mississippi, plus an additional $45 million for the CO2 pipeline to East  Mississippi,  increasing  our combined CO2 and tertiary  recovery related  expenditures to over 60% of our current 2005 capital budget.  Our Tertiary Oil Fields       Little Creek Field was  discovered in 1958,  and by 1962 the field had been unitized and waterflooding had commenced.  The pilot phase of CO2 flooding began in 1974 and the first two phases (each in a distinct area of the field) began in 1985. When we acquired the field in 1999, the first two phases were complete and the third  phase was in process.  We have  completed  development  of the third, fourth and fifth phases and most of the currently  planned  development  work at this field,  although we will  continue to modify  existing  patterns  and drill wells as necessary  to recover the maximum  amount of oil or to extend the field into areas that have not benefited  from CO2 injection.  Currently  there are 28 producing wells and 34 injection wells at Little Creek.  Based on the results of the two earliest phases of CO2 flooding at Little Creek,  tertiary  recovery has increased the ultimate  recovery  factor in the flooded  portion of the field by approximately  17%, as compared to recoveries of  approximately  20% for primary recovery and 18% for secondary recovery.  The field has produced a cumulative 16 MMBbls (gross) of light sweet crude, as a result of tertiary operations,  and we currently estimate that an additional 6.1 MMBbls (gross) can be recovered.       Production from Little Creek Field was  approximately  1,350 Bbls/d when we acquired the field in 1999.  During the fourth  quarter of 2004,  production had increased to an average of 2,989 BOE/d  (including  Lazy  Creek).  We expect the production  from Little Creek to increase  further during 2005 by another 150 to                                         7 Denbury Resources Inc.  250 BOE/d.  From inception  through  December 31, 2004, we had net positive cash flow (revenues less  operating  expenses and capital  expenditures)  from Little Creek  (including  Lazy Creek) of $48.5 million (at the field  level),  plus the fields have a PV-10 Value, using December 31, 2004 SEC NYMEX pricing,  of $122.3 million.       We purchased West Mallalieu Field in May 2001.  Shell Oil Company  unitized West  Mallalieu  Field and commenced a pilot project in 1986. The pilot project, consisting of four 5-spot patterns,  has cumulatively produced approximately 2.1 MMBbls of oil as a result of CO2 flooding. We have expanded the pilot project by adding four  additional  patterns  during  2001,  four  patterns in 2002,  three patterns in 2003,  and two patterns in 2004. We also completed our first pattern in East Mallalieu  during 2004.  During 2002 we began to see initial response to CO2 injection as the West Mallalieu  Field averaged 778 Bbls/d during the fourth quarter of 2002.  Response continued  throughout 2003 and 2004,  averaging 3,712 Bbls/d  during the fourth  quarter of 2004.  In contrast to Little  Creek Field, West Mallalieu Field was not waterflooded prior to CO2 injection.  Therefore, we believe that the tertiary  recovery of oil from West Mallalieu Field as a result of CO2  injection  could  exceed the 17% of original oil in place that we expect from Little Creek Field.       We  purchased  McComb  Field in 2002,  a field  with no pilot  programs  or tertiary operations at that time and virtually no current oil production. McComb is very close in proximity and  analogous to Little Creek and Mallalieu  Fields. We commenced  tertiary recovery  operations in 2003 by substantially  completing two  patterns,  and by November  2003 had  started  injecting  CO2.  Significant development  occurred  during  2004 as we  expanded  the nearby  Olive Field CO2 facility to handle the  processing of McComb's  produced oil,  water and CO2 and developed an additional four patterns.  The production response occurred earlier than  expected,  with the field  averaging  540 Bbls/d in the fourth  quarter of 2004.  During  2005,  we expect to add three  patterns  within  McComb Field and further  expand the  production  facilities.  In  addition,  we also started our initial work on an additional  CO2 flood at nearby  Smithdale  Field during 2004 utilizing  the same CO2  facilities,  with CO2  injections  expected to begin in early 2005. We believe that the total  potential at McComb and Smithdale  Fields is  significantly  higher than the current proved reserves (at McComb only), and therefore  expect to add additional  reserves and have upward reserve  revisions here over the next several years as we fully develop these fields.       Initial  development of the Brookhaven  Field, a field acquired during 2002 in the COHO acquisition,  began in late 2004 with the first injections of CO2 in January 2005.  During 2005, we plan to complete  development of the two patterns initiated in 2004 and develop an additional  seven  patterns,  but do not expect any significant production response from this field until early 2006.       At December 31, 2004,  we have proved  reserves of 50.5 MMBbls  relating to our tertiary  recovery  operations.  Through  December 31, 2004, we have spent a total of $155.6 million on fields in this area, and have received $160.0 million in net operating income (revenue less operating expenses),  or net positive cash flow of $4.4 million.  These amounts do not include the capital costs or related depreciation and  amortization of our CO2 producing  properties at Jackson Dome, which had a net  unrecovered  cost  balance of $75.4  million as of December 31, 2004.  At year-end  2004,  the proved oil reserves in our CO2 fields had a PV-10 Value, using December 31, 2004 SEC NYMEX pricing, of $782.9 million.  Heidelberg and East Mississippi       We own interests in 477 wells in the eastern part of the  Mississippi  salt basin and operate 436 of these wells (91%) from our  regional  office in Laurel, Mississippi.  These fields  produced an average of 10,601 Bbls/d and 17.8 MMcf/d during  the  fourth  quarter  of 2004.  We have been  active in this area  since Denbury was founded in 1990 and are by far the largest producer in the basin, as well as in the state of Mississippi. Since we have generally owned these eastern Mississippi properties longer than properties in our other regions, they tend to be more fully developed.  During 2004, we spent a total of  approximately  $38.4 million  (excluding  acquisitions),  drilling  53 wells and  performing  various workovers and recompletions.  Production in eastern Mississippi  averaged 13,085 BOE/d during 2004,  down  slightly  from the 2003 average of 13,638  BOE/d.  For 2005,  we expect our budget in this region for  conventional  operations to be a little  lower than it was in 2004,  approximately  $28.6  million,  or 9% of our current 2005 exploration and development  budget of $305 million  (including the                                         8 Denbury Resources Inc.  East  Mississippi  CO2 pipeline),  and as discussed  above,  we have budgeted an additional  $50.2  million to  initiate  three  tertiary  recovery  projects  at Martinville, Soso and Eucutta Fields.       The  fields in this  region  are  characterized  by  structural  traps that generate  prolific  production from stacked or multiple pay sands. As such, they provide   opportunities   to  increase   reserves   through  infield   drilling, recompleting wells, improving production efficiency, and in some cases, by water flooding  producing  reservoirs.  Most of our wells in this area  produce  large amounts of saltwater and require large pumps, which increase the operating costs per barrel  relative  to our  properties  in  Louisiana  that are  predominantly natural gas  producers.  We plan to continue our basic  strategy in this region, supplemented  by  additional  waterflooding  (secondary  recovery)  and tertiary operations.       The largest  field in the region,  and our largest  field  corporately,  is Heidelberg  Field,  which for the fourth  quarter of 2004 produced an average of 8,266 BOE/d.  Heidelberg  Field was acquired from Chevron in December 1997. This field was discovered in 1944 and has produced an estimated 204 MMBbls of oil and 57 Bcf of gas since its  discovery.  The field is a large  salt-cored  anticline that is divided into western and eastern  segments due to  subsequent  faulting. There are 11 producing  formations in Heidelberg  Field containing 40 individual reservoirs, with the majority of the past and current production coming from the Eutaw, Selma Chalk and Christmas sands at depths of 3,500 to 5,000 feet. When we acquired the property in 1997, production was approximately 2,800 BOE/d.       The primary oil production at Heidelberg is from five waterflood units that produce from the Eutaw formation (at approximately  4,400 feet). These units are generally  developed  although they will require additional work and capital for the next few years. In addition,  Heidelberg is our second largest gas field. We began extensive  development of the Selma Chalk natural gas reservoir at a depth of 3,700 feet in 2000 and 2001.  Previous operators had only partially developed this  formation  in order to  provide  fuel  gas for the rest of the  field.  We drilled 13 to 15 wells each year in 2001,  2002 and 2003,  with an additional 24 natural gas wells  drilled in 2004,  increasing  the natural gas  production  at Heidelberg to an average for 2004 of approximately  13.8 MMcf/d. We believe that there are  opportunities  to expand the field limits,  to continue  reducing the well spacing and to stimulate  the Upper Selma Chalk to achieve  additional  gas reserves  in the Selma  Chalk.  We plan to drill 16  additional  gas wells  here during 2005, including our first horizontal test in the Selma Chalk.  Eucutta Field       Eucutta  Field was purchased  from Amerada Hess in 1995.  The field is very analogous to Heidelberg field in that the majority of its historical  production was produced from the Eutaw  formation.  Eucutta was unitized for water flooding in 1966 and has gone through several stages of  development.  During the 1980's, Amerada Hess installed an inverted  5-spot pilot test in the City Bank sand (one of the Eutaw sands) to test the application of CO2 flooding.  Although the pilot test only  covered  approximately  20 acres,  the pilot test was  successful  in recovering  an  additional  17% of the original oil in place within the pattern. Based on this success,  we have designed a CO2 project for the Eucutta Field and plan to build our CO2 facilities and develop three patterns during 2005. Initial injection  of CO2 is  projected  to commence  mid-2006,  although it could start earlier if our CO2 pipeline to East Mississippi is completed sooner.  Soso Field       Soso Field was purchased from COHO  Resources in 2002.  Although this field produces from numerous sands,  the majority of our work in 2005 will involve the building of CO2 facilities and  establishing two patterns in the Bailey sand and two partial  patterns  in the Cotton  Valley  sands.  This field has not had any previous CO2 injection or pilot projects. In reviewing Soso Field we studied the Bailey sand which was one of the more prolific  reservoirs  within the field and exhibited  characteristics of a depletion drive reservoir.  The Bailey reservoir oil is 43.4 API  gravity,  similar  to our West  Mississippi  floods,  and is at approximately  the same depth and has very  similar  reservoir  characteristics, thus we expect the Bailey  tertiary  flood to perform in a similar manner to our West Mississippi CO2 floods.                                         9 Denbury Resources Inc.  Martinville Field       Martinville field was purchased from COHO Resources in 2002. As is the case with all of the East  Mississippi  fields,  Martinville  produces  from multiple reservoirs.  Unlike the majority of our other planned CO2 projects,  Martinville does not  contain  one very large  reservoir  to CO2 flood,  but rather  several smaller  reservoirs.  We have identified  three CO2 formations at Martinville on which  we plan  to  initiate  CO2  flooding  following  completion  of our  East Mississippi  CO2  pipeline.  The  first  reservoir  to be  CO2  flooded  is  the Mooringsport,  which,  because it has been  waterflooded very  successfully,  is expected to CO2 flood  successfully as well. We plan to install the required CO2 facilities and essentially  complete the development of the Mooringsport  during 2005. The second reservoir,  the Rodessa, has similar reservoir  characteristics to the Mooringsport.  We expect to initiate  injection into the Rodessa with the completion  of one  injector.  The  final  reservoir  is  the  Wash  Fred  8500' reservoir. This reservoir contains a low gravity oil, 15 API, which will clearly not develop  miscibility with CO2 at reservoir  conditions.  Denbury has several fields with similar gravity oils,  which like the Wash Fred 8500' have had lower recoveries  due to the low gravity  oil and a strong  water drive which does not drive the oil  efficiently.  We plan to  initiate  injection  into the Wash Fred 8500'  reservoir at the crest of the structure,  allow the CO2 to swell the oil, decrease  the oil  viscosity,  and  displace  the water and oil  downward in the reservoir to the producing  wells.  Successful  implemention of a CO2 project in the Wash Fred 8500'  reservoir  would provide the impetus to look at a whole new set of fields that have  historically  not been  considered  for CO2  injection, although  there can be no assurance  that this  technique  will be successful or economic.  Texas and the Barnett Shale       We own about 20,000 acres of leases and working interest in 29 wells in the Fort Worth Basin in North Central Texas that is  prospective  for natural gas in the  Barnett  Shale.  We  currently  operate  18 of  the  producing  wells  with essentially 100% ownership in most of the remaining  development  potential.  We acquired  the majority of this acreage in 2001 and have been working to find the optimum method to drill,  complete and produce the Barnett Shale. We drilled six wells in  2001,  two in  2002,  five in 2003 and 18 in 2004,  seven by us and 11 under a farmout  arrangement  where we retained a 25% working  interest.  During 2004 we drilled our first three  horizontal  wells that  produced at much higher initial rates and declined slower than our previous  vertical wells. As a result of this initial  success,  we expanded our 2004 capital  budget and drilled four additional  horizontal  wells. The average initial producing rate for these 2004 horizontal wells is approximately 2 MMcf/d. We are still refining our fracturing technique,  including an analysis of the best number of fracture  treatments  to adequately stimulate the entire length of our lateral sections, which can exceed 4,000 feet.  Initial reserve estimates for these horizontal wells appear to be 3 to 4 times greater than the vertical  wells we initially  drilled.  Although our production during the fourth quarter of 2004 averaged only 4.4 MMcf/d, we expect production in this area to grow substantially  during 2005. During 2005, we plan to drill approximately 25 horizontal wells. Including seismic costs and pipeline infrastructure costs, our planned 2005 capital expenditures in the Barnett Shale is estimated to be $31 million of our $305 million capital budget (including the East Mississippi CO2 Pipeline).       During 2004, we also  committed the necessary  capital to shoot 3-D seismic data over our entire acreage  position,  50 to 60 square miles.  We received our first  seismic  data in  February  2005 and expect to have the  majority  of the remaining  data by May 2005.  The 3-D  seismic  data  should  allow us to better locate our wells so that we encounter less faulting and  underground  sink holes which have been associated with fracture  stimulations into zones outside of the Barnett Shale that are typically water bearing.       During 2004, we continued to address the issue of pipeline  capacity in our area of the Barnett  Shale play by  installing  additional  pipelines to relieve some packed lines. The largest gas purchaser in the area is installing a new 20" gas line to handle  the  increasing  volumes  of gas in our area.  In  addition, several other gas buyers and pipeline companies are entering the area and making plans to install  additional  pipelines to handle the anticipated future volumes of gas.                                         10 Denbury Resources Inc.  South Louisiana       We own interests in 84 wells in the land and marshes of south Louisiana and one  non-operated  offshore  well  that we did not  include  in our 2004 sale of offshore properties. We operate 71 of these wells (85%) from our regional office in Houma, Louisiana.  This region produces primarily natural gas, averaging 33.7 MMcf/d net to our interest in the fourth quarter of 2004,  approximately  60% of our total  natural gas  production.  During 2004, we spent  approximately  $23.7 million (excluding acquisitions) in this region,  approximately 11% of our total exploration  and  development  expenditures,  drilling  approximately  10 wells, primarily in the Thornwell and Terrebonne  Parish areas.  For 2005, our spending is expected to be about the same,  with a budget of $28.8 million,  or 9% of our $305 million  exploration and development budget (including our East Mississippi CO2 pipeline).       The  majority of our onshore  Louisiana  fields lie in the Houma  embayment area of Terrebonne Parish,  including Lirette, and South Chauvin Fields, and our recent shallow natural gas plays at Bayou Sauveur and Gibson Fields.  The advent of 3D seismic  data in these  geologically  complex  areas has become a valuable tool in exploration and development. We currently own or have a license covering over 1,000 square miles of 3D data, and plan to expand our data ownership during 2005. During 2004, we expanded our seismic holdings in this area by acquiring an additional  188 square miles of 3D data.  We drilled  seven wells in  Terrebonne Parish  during 2004,  four of which were  successful.  In 2005, we plan to drill approximately  six exploratory  wells in Terrebonne Parish and three development wells.       Historically  we have had good success  with a shallow  natural gas play in Terrebonne  Parish.  These shallow gas reservoirs are  approximately  3,000 feet deep,  but have the ability to produce from 1.0 to 4.0 MMcf/d.  During 2004,  we drilled one successful and one unsuccessful well. We plan to drill an additional 6 shallow gas prospects in Terrebonne  Parish during 2005,  with another 5 to 15 additional shallow gas prospects in Terrebonne Parish under review.       Thornwell Field is characterized by short-life  natural gas properties that have high  initial  production  rates with a good rate of return,  but which are depleted  in two to three  years.  The high rates of decline  have  dramatically impacted our overall  production  rates the last two years,  and are expected to continue to do so throughout 2005.  Production at Thornwell Field averaged 4,275 BOE/d in 2001, 3,910 BOE/d in 2002, 2,564 BOE/d in 2003 and 1,487 BOE/d in 2004, and is expected to average approximately 750 BOE/d during 2005. Even though this field has negatively  affected our overall  production  growth, the purchase and development of this field has been  profitable.  We had significant  activity at this field during 2001 and 2002, with positive results, but reduced our activity during  2003 and 2004 as the field  became more fully  developed.  Our plans for 2005 include the drilling of one  exploratory  well to test the Marg Tex/Bol Mex sands and two development wells in the Bol Perc. From inception through December 31, 2004, we have net positive cash flow  (revenue less  operating  expenses and capital expenditures) to date of $37.0 million from this field, with a remaining proved PV-10 Value, using December 31, 2004 constant SEC NYMEX pricing, of $37.4 million.                                          11 Denbury Resources Inc.  FIELD SUMMARIES       Denbury  operates in four primary areas:  Louisiana,  Eastern  Mississippi, Western  Mississippi and Texas. Our 11 largest fields (listed below)  constitute approximately 90% of our total proved reserves on a BOE basis and 89% on a PV-10 Value  basis.  Within  these 11 fields,  we own a weighted  average  89% working interest  and  operate  all of these  fields.  The  concentration  of value in a relatively  small number of fields allows us to benefit  substantially  from any operating cost reductions or production enhancements we achieve and allows us to effectively  manage the properties  from our two primary field offices in Houma, Louisiana, and Laurel, Mississippi.

A  developmental  well is a well      drilled  within the  presently  proved  productive  area of an oil or natural gas  reservoir,  as indicated by      reasonable interpretation of available data, with the objective of completing in that reservoir.  (2)  A productive well is an exploratory or development well found to be capable of producing either oil or natural      gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well.  (3)  A nonproductive well is an exploratory or development well that is not a producing well.  (4)  During 2004,  2003 and 2002,  an  additional  8, 5, and 9 wells,  respectively,  were drilled for water or CO2      injection purposes.
PRODUCTION AND UNIT PRICES       Information  regarding average  production rates, unit sale prices and unit costs per BOE are set forth  under  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations  - Operating  Income"  included herein.  TITLE TO PROPERTIES       Customarily  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry,  only  a  perfunctory  title examination  is  conducted  at the time  properties  believed to be suitable for drilling  operations  are first  acquired.  Prior to  commencement  of  drilling operations,  a thorough drill site title examination is normally conducted,  and curative  work  is  performed  with  respect  to  significant  defects.   During acquisitions,  title reviews are performed on all  properties;  however,  formal title opinions are obtained on only the higher value properties. We believe that we have good  title to our oil and  natural  gas  properties,  some of which are subject to minor encumbrances, easements and restrictions.  GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS       All of our operations are in the United States.                                         14 Denbury Resources Inc.  SIGNIFICANT OIL AND GAS PURCHASERS AND PRODUCT MARKETING       Oil and gas sales are made on a day-to-day basis under short-term contracts at the current area market price.  The loss of any single purchaser would not be expected to have a material  adverse effect upon our  operations;  however,  the loss of a large single  purchaser could  potentially  reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production,  which in turn could  negatively  impact the prices we receive.  For the year ended  December 31, 2004, we had two purchasers that each  accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas  revenues:  Hunt Refining (21%) and Genesis Energy,  L.P. (14%).  For the year ended December 31, 2003,  two  purchasers  each  accounted  for more  than 10% of our total oil and natural gas revenues:  Hunt Refining (15%) and Genesis Energy,  L.P. (12%).  For the year ended December 31, 2002, two purchasers  each accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas  revenues:  Hunt Refining  (14%) and Genesis  Energy, L.P. (11%).       Our ability to market oil and natural  gas depends on many  factors  beyond our control,  including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the proximity of our gas production to pipelines, the available capacity in such pipelines,  the demand for oil and natural gas, the effects of weather, and the effects of state and federal  regulation.  Our  production is primarily from developed  fields  close  to  major  pipelines  or  refineries  and  established infrastructure.  As a result,  we have not experienced any difficulty to date in finding  a  market  for all of our  production  as it  becomes  available  or in transporting  our  production to those markets;  however,  there is no assurance that we will always be able to market all of our production or obtain  favorable prices.  Oil Marketing       The  quality of our crude oil  varies by area as well as the  corresponding price received.  In Heidelberg  Field,  our single largest field,  and our other Eastern Mississippi properties,  our oil production is primarily light to medium sour crude and sells at a significant  discount to the NYMEX prices.  In Western Mississippi, our current CO2 operations, and in Louisiana, our oil production is primarily  light sweet crude,  which  typically  sells at near NYMEX prices,  or often at a premium.  For the year ended  December 31, 2004, the discount for our oil production from Heidelberg  Field averaged $9.80 per Bbl and for our Eastern Mississippi  properties as a whole the discount  averaged $8.84 per Bbl relative to NYMEX oil prices.  For Mallalieu  Field,  the largest producer during 2004 of our CO2  properties in Western  Mississippi,  we averaged a premium of $1.20 per Bbl over NYMEX oil prices,  and $1.13 per Bbl over NYMEX prices for our tertiary oil production in Western Mississippi taken as a whole. Our Louisiana properties averaged $2.39 per Bbl below NYMEX prices during 2004.  Natural Gas Marketing       Virtually all of our natural gas production is close to existing  pipelines and  consequently,  we generally have a variety of options to market our natural gas. We sell the majority of our natural gas on one year  contracts  with prices fluctuating  month-to-month  based on  published  pipeline  indices  with slight premiums or discounts to the index.  OPERATING ENVIRONMENT RISK FACTORS  Oil and Natural Gas Price Volatility       Our future  financial  condition,  results of  operations  and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depends primarily upon the prices we receive  for our oil and  natural  gas  production.  Oil and  natural gas prices historically  have been  volatile and likely will continue to be volatile in the future,  especially given current world geopolitical  conditions.  Our cash flow from  operations  is highly  dependent on the prices that we receive for oil and natural  gas.  This price  volatility  also  affects the amount of our cash flow available  for capital  expenditures  and our  ability to borrow  money or raise additional capital.  The amount we can borrow or have outstanding under our bank credit facility is subject to semi-annual  redeterminations.  In the short-term, our  production  is  relatively  balanced  between  oil  and  natural  gas,  but long-term,  oil  prices  are  likely to affect us more than  natural  gas prices because approximately 78% of our proved reserves are oil. The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of  additional  factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:       o    the level of consumer demand for oil and natural gas;       o    the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;                                         15 Denbury Resources Inc.       o    the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting           Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;       o    the price of foreign oil and natural gas;       o    domestic governmental regulations and taxes;       o    the price and availability of alternative fuel sources;       o    weather conditions;       o    market uncertainty;       o    political  conditions  in  oil  and  natural  gas  producing  regions,           including the Middle East; and       o    worldwide economic conditions.       These factors and the  volatility of the energy  markets  generally make it extremely  difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price  movements with any  certainty.  Also,  oil and  natural gas prices do not  necessarily  move in tandem.  Declines in oil and natural gas prices  would not only reduce  revenue, but  could  reduce  the  amount  of oil and  natural  gas  that  we can  produce economically  and, as a result,  could have a material  adverse  effect upon our financial condition, results of operations, oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying  values of our oil and natural gas  properties.  If the oil and natural gas industry experiences significant price declines, we may, among other things, be unable to meet our financial obligations or make planned expenditures.       Since the end of 1998,  oil prices have gone from near  historic low prices to historic highs. At the end of 1998, NYMEX oil prices were at historic lows of approximately  $12.00 per Bbl,  but have  generally  increased  since that time, albeit with  fluctuations.  For 2004,  NYMEX oil prices were high throughout the year,  averaging over $41.00 per Bbl,  ending the year at $43.45 per Bbl. During 2004, the price we received for our heavier, sour crude oil did not correlate as well with NYMEX prices as it has historically. During 2002 and 2003, our average discount to NYMEX was $3.73 per Bbl and $3.60 per Bbl respectively. During 2004, this  differential  increased  to $4.91  per Bbl for the year as a result of the price  deterioration  for heavier,  sour crudes,  and was even higher during the fourth  quarter,  averaging  $6.48 per Bbl.  While we attempt to obtain the best price for our crude in our  marketing  efforts,  we cannot  control these market price  swings and are  subject to the  market  volatility  for this type of oil. These price differentials relative to NYMEX prices can have as much of an impact on our profitability as does the volatility in the NYMEX oil prices.       Natural gas prices  have also  experienced  volatility  during the last few years. During 1999 natural gas prices averaged  approximately $2.35 per Mcf and, like crude oil, have  generally  trended  upward since that time,  although with significant  fluctuations  along the way.  For 2004,  NYMEX  natural  gas prices averaged over $6.00 per MMBtu, ending the year at $6.15 per MMBtu.  Product Price Derivative Hedging Contracts       To reduce our  exposure  to  fluctuations  in the prices of oil and natural gas, we currently  and may in the future enter into hedging  arrangements  for a portion of our oil and natural gas production. Hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:       o    production is less than expected;       o    the  counter-party  to the hedging  contract  defaults on its contract           obligations (as was the case with respect to our hedges placed in 2001           with an  Enron  subsidiary  as  counterparty,  which  resulted  in our           suffering a loss); or       o    there is a change in the expected  differential between the underlying           price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received.                                         16 Denbury Resources Inc.       In  addition,  these  hedging  arrangements  may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas.  Information as to these  activities is set forth under  "Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations - Market Risk Management," and in Note  9,  "Derivative   Hedging   Contracts,"  to  the  Consolidated   Financial Statements.  Oil and Natural Gas Drilling and Producing Operations       Drilling  activities are subject to many risks,  including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. There can be no assurance that new wells  drilled by us will be  productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our  investment  in such wells.  Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve  unprofitable  efforts,  not only from dry wells but also from wells that are  productive  but do not  produce  sufficient  net  reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The seismic data and other  technologies  used by us do not provide  conclusive  knowledge,  prior to drilling  a  well,  that  oil or  natural  gas  is  present  or may be  produced economically.  The cost of drilling,  completing  and  operating a well is often uncertain,  and cost factors can  adversely  affect the  economics of a project. Further,  our drilling  operations  may be  curtailed,  delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:       o    unexpected drilling conditions;       o    title problems;       o    pressure or irregularities in formations;       o    equipment failures or accidents;       o    adverse weather conditions;       o    compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and       o    cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs,           equipment and services.       Our  operations  are  subject  to all the risks  normally  incident  to the operation and  development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including  encountering well blowouts,  cratering and explosions,   pipe  failure,   fires,   formations   with  abnormal   pressures, uncontrollable  flows of oil,  natural  gas,  brine or well  fluids,  release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental hazards and risks.       In accordance with industry  practice,  we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks  described  above in an amount we believe is adequate. However,  the nature of these risks is such that some  liabilities  could exceed our policy  limits,  or, as in the case of  environmental  fines and  penalties, cannot be insured.  We could incur  significant  costs,  related to these risks, that  could  have a  material  adverse  effect  on our  results  of  operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Use of Carbon Dioxide in Tertiary Recovery Operations       The crude oil production  from our tertiary  recovery  projects  depends on having access to sufficient  amounts of carbon  dioxide.  Our ability to produce this oil would be hindered if our supply of carbon  dioxide  were limited due to problems  with  our  current  CO2  producing  wells  and  facilities,  including compression equipment,  or catastrophic pipeline failure. Our anticipated future production is also dependent on our ability to increase the  production  volumes of CO2. If our crude oil  production  were to decline,  it could have a material adverse  effect on our financial  condition and results of  operations.  Our CO2 tertiary  recovery  projects  require a  significant  amount of  electricity  to operate the facilities. If these costs were to increase significantly,  it could have a material adverse effect upon the profitability of these operations.  Future Performance and Acquisitions       Unless we can  successfully  replace  the  reserves  that we  produce,  our reserves will decline, resulting eventually in a decrease in oil and natural gas production  and  lower  revenues  and  cash  flows  from  operations.   We  have                                         17 Denbury Resources Inc.  historically  replaced reserves through both drilling and  acquisitions.  In the future we may not be able to continue to replace  reserves at acceptable  costs. The  business of exploring  for,  developing  or  acquiring  reserves is capital intensive.  We may not be  able to make  the  necessary  capital  investment  to maintain  or expand  our oil and  natural  gas  reserves  if our cash flows from operations are reduced, due to lower oil or natural gas prices or otherwise,  or if external  sources of capital  become  limited or  unavailable.  Further,  the process  of using  CO2 for  tertiary  recovery  and the  related  infrastructure requires  significant  capital  investment,  often one to two years prior to any resulting production and cash flows from these projects,  heightening  potential capital  constraints.  If  we  do  not  continue  to  make  significant  capital expenditures, or if outside capital resources become limited, we may not be able to maintain our growth rate. In addition, our drilling activities are subject to numerous  risks,  including  the risk  that no  commercially  productive  oil or natural gas reserves will be  encountered.  Exploratory  drilling  involves more risk than development  drilling because exploratory drilling is designed to test formations for which proved reserves have not been discovered.       We are continually identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities and we have successfully completed acquisitions  throughout our history.  Estimating the reserves and forecasted  production  from acquired  properties is inherently difficult  and may  result in our  inability  to achieve  or  maintain  targeted production  levels.  In that case,  our  ability to realize  the total  economic benefit  from the  acquisition  may be  reduced or  eliminated.  There can be no assurance that we will successfully  consummate any future  acquisitions or that such  acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties  will contain  economically recoverable   reserves  or  that  any  future  acquisition  will  be  profitably integrated into our operations.  COMPETITION AND MARKETS       We face competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of our business,  including  acquisition of producing properties and oil and gas leases,  marketing of oil and gas, and obtaining goods, services and labor. Many of our competitors  have  substantially  larger  financial and other  resources. Factors  that  affect  our  ability  to  acquire  producing  properties  include available funds,  available  information  about  prospective  properties and our standards  established  for minimum  projected  return on investment.  Gathering systems are the only practical  method for the  intermediate  transportation  of natural  gas.  Therefore,  competition  for natural gas delivery is presented by other  pipelines and gas gathering  systems.  Competition  is also  presented by alternative fuel sources,  including heating oil and other fossil fuels. Because of the  long-lived,  high  margin  nature  of  our  oil  and  gas  reserves  and management's  experience and expertise in exploiting these reserves,  we believe that we are effective in competing in the market.       The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct  field  operations,  geologists,  geophysicists,   engineers  and  other professionals  in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate  significantly, often  in  correlation  with  oil  and  natural  gas  prices,  causing  periodic shortages.  There have also been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment  has  increased  along with the number of wells being  drilled.  These  factors  also cause  significant  increases in costs for equipment,  services and personnel.  Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate  increased  demand and result in increased  prices for drilling  rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. We cannot be certain when we will experience  these issues and these types of shortages or price increases could significantly  decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results or restrict our ability to drill those wells and conduct those  operations  that we currently have planned and budgeted.  FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS       Numerous  federal  and state  laws and  regulations  govern the oil and gas industry. These laws and regulations are often changed in response to changes in the political or economic environment.  Compliance with this evolving regulatory burden is often difficult and costly, and substantial  penalties may be incurred for  noncompliance.  The  following  section  describes  some  specific laws and regulations  that may affect us. We cannot predict the impact of these or future legislative or regulatory initiatives.       Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with all laws and regulations  applicable to our  operations and that  continued  compliance  with existing  requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us. The future annual  capital  costs of  complying  with  the  regulations  applicable  to our operations  is  uncertain  and will be  governed by several  factors,  including                                         18 Denbury Resources Inc.  future  changes  to  regulatory  requirements.   However,  management  does  not currently  anticipate  that future  compliance  will have a  materially  adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  Regulation of Natural Gas and Oil Exploration and Production       Our  operations  are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.  Such regulation includes requiring permits for drilling wells,  maintaining bonding  requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells,  the method of drilling and casing wells,  the surface use and  restoration  of  properties  upon which wells are drilled,  the plugging and  abandoning  of wells and the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations.  Our operations are also subject to various  conservation  laws and  regulations.  These  include the  regulation  of the size of  drilling  and spacing  units or proration  units and the density of wells which may be drilled in those  units and the  unitization  or pooling of oil and gas  properties.  In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas  wells,  generally  prohibit  the  venting  or flaring of gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations  may limit the amount of oil and gas we can  produce  from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the  locations  at which we can drill.  The regulatory  burden  on the oil and gas  industry  increases  our  costs of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability.  Federal Regulation of Sales Prices and Transportation       The transportation and certain sales of natural gas in interstate  commerce are  heavily  regulated  by  agencies  of the U.S.  federal  government  and are affected by the availability,  terms and cost of transportation.  In particular, the  price  and  terms of  access to  pipeline  transportation  are  subject  to extensive  U.S.  federal and state  regulation.  The Federal  Energy  Regulatory Commission  ("FERC") is  continually  proposing and  implementing  new rules and regulations  affecting the natural gas industry.  The stated  purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote  competition among the various sectors of the  natural  gas  industry.  The  ultimate  impact  of the  complex  rules  and regulations  issued by FERC cannot be predicted.  Some of FERC's  proposals may, however,  adversely  affect the  availability  and reliability of  interruptible transportation  service on interstate  pipelines.  While our sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently subject to FERC regulation, our  ability  to  transport  and sell such  products  is  dependent  on  certain pipelines  whose  rates,  terms and  conditions  of service  are subject to FERC regulation.  Additional  proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas  industry  are  considered  from  time  to  time by  Congress,  FERC,  state regulatory  bodies  and the  courts.  We  cannot  predict  when  or if any  such proposals  might become  effective and their effect,  if any, on our operations. Historically,  the natural gas industry has been heavily  regulated;  therefore, there is no  assurance  that the less  stringent  regulatory  approach  recently pursued by FERC,  Congress and the states will  continue  indefinitely  into the future.  Natural Gas Gathering Regulations       State  regulation of natural gas  gathering  facilities  generally  include various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements.  Although such  regulation  has not generally  been  affirmatively applied by state agencies,  natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.  Federal, State or Indian Leases       Our  operations on federal,  state or Indian oil and gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions,  including nondiscrimination statutes. Such operations must be conducted  pursuant to certain  on-site  security  regulations and other permits and  authorizations  issued by the Bureau of Land  Management,  Minerals Management Service ("MMS") and other agencies.  Environmental Regulations       Public  interest  in  the  protection  of  the  environment  has  increased dramatically  in recent years.  Our oil and natural gas production and saltwater disposal  operations  and our  processing,  handling  and  disposal of hazardous materials,  such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring  radioactive  materials are subject to stringent regulation. We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs resulting from a release of hazardous material, third-party claims for property  damage and personal  injuries fines and sanctions,  as a result of any violations or liabilities under  environmental or other laws.  Changes in or more stringent enforcement of environmental laws could also result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures.                                         19 Denbury Resources Inc.       Various federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into  the  environment,   or  otherwise   relating  to  the  protection  of  the environment, directly impact oil and gas exploration, development and production operations,  and  consequently  may impact the Company's  operations  and costs. These regulations include,  among others, (i) regulations by the EPA and various state agencies  regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous   wastes;   (ii)   the   Comprehensive    Environmental   Response, Compensation,  and Liability Act, Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state laws which regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed  wastes  (including  wastes  disposed of or released by prior owners or operators),  property contamination (including groundwater  contamination),  and remedial plugging  operations to prevent future  contamination;  (iii) the Clean Air Act and  comparable  state and local  requirements  which may  result in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from the operations of the Company; (iv) the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 which contains numerous  requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United  States;  (v) the Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage  and  disposal  of  hazardous  wastes;  and (vi) state  regulations  and statutes  governing the handling,  treatment,  storage and disposal of naturally occurring radioactive material ("NORM").       Management  believes that we are in substantial  compliance with applicable environmental  laws and regulations.  To date, we have not expended any material amounts to comply  with such  regulations,  and  management  does not  currently anticipate that future  compliance will have a materially  adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  ESTIMATED  NET  QUANTITIES  OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND PRESENT  VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET REVENUES       DeGolyer  and  MacNaughton,  independent  petroleum  engineers  located  in Dallas, Texas, prepared estimates of our net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2004,  2003 and 2002.  The reserve  estimates  were  prepared using  constant  prices  and  costs in  accordance  with the  guidelines  of the Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC").  The prices used in preparation of the reserve  estimates  were based on the market prices in effect as of December 31 of each year,  with the  appropriate  adjustments  (transportation,  gravity, basic sediment and water "BS&W," purchasers' bonuses, Btu, etc.) applied to each field.  The reserve  estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped  acreage. The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interests in our properties.       Our proved  nonproducing  reserves primarily relate to reserves that are to be recovered  from  productive  zones that are  currently  behind pipe.  Since a majority  of  our  properties  are in  areas  with  multiple  pay  zones,  these properties   typically  have  both  proved  producing  and  proved  nonproducing reserves.       Proved undeveloped  reserves associated with our CO2 tertiary operations in West Mississippi and our Heidelberg  waterfloods in East Mississippi account for approximately  96% of our proved  undeveloped  oil reserves.  We consider  these reserves to be lower risk than other proved  undeveloped  reserves  that require drilling at locations offsetting existing production because all of these proved undeveloped reserves are associated with secondary recovery or tertiary recovery operations  in fields and  reservoirs  that  historically  produced  substantial volumes of oil under  primary  production.  The main reason  these  reserves are classified as undeveloped is because they require significant additional capital associated with drilling/re-entering  wells or additional facilities in order to produce the reserves  and/or are waiting for a production  response to the water or CO2 injections.                                         20 Denbury Resources Inc.       Our proved  undeveloped  natural gas  reserves,  associated  with our Selma Chalk play at  Heidelberg  and the  Barnett  Shale play in Newark,  East  fields account for  approximately 87% of our proved  undeveloped  natural gas reserves. The remaining  undeveloped  natural gas reserves are spread over multiple fields with  the  single  largest  field  accounting  for  less  than  5% of the  total undeveloped natural gas reserves.  This particular field's undeveloped  reserves are currently being developed with first  production  expected late in the first quarter of 2005.  Our current  plans for 2005  include  development  of 20 to 25 wells in each of our  primary  natural gas plays,  the  Barnett  Shale and Selma Chalk.

There are  numerous  uncertainties  inherent in  estimating  quantities  of proved oil and natural gas reserves  and their  values,  including  many factors beyond our control.  The reserve data included herein represents only estimates. Reserve   engineering  is  a  subjective   process  of  estimating   underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The  accuracy of any reserve  estimate is a function of the quality of available geological,  geophysical,  engineering  and economic  data, the precision of the engineering and judgment.  As a result,  estimates of different  engineers often vary.  The estimates of reserves,  future cash flows and present value are based on various  assumptions,  including those  prescribed by the SEC relating to oil and natural gas prices,  drilling and operating expenses,  capital expenditures, taxes and  availability of funds,  and are inherently  imprecise.  Actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures,  operating expenses and quantities of  recoverable  oil and natural gas reserves may vary  substantially from our estimates.  Such  variations may be  significant  and could  materially affect estimated quantities and the present value of our proved reserves.  Also, the use of a 10% discount  factor for  reporting  purposes  may not  necessarily represent the most appropriate  discount factor, given actual interest rates and risks to which  Denbury or the oil and  natural  gas  industry  in  general  are subject.  See also Note 13,  "Supplemental  Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures," to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       You should not assume that the present values referred to herein  represent the current  market  value of our  estimated  oil and natural gas  reserves.  In accordance  with  requirements  of the SEC, the estimates of present  values are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimates.  Actual future prices and costs may be materially  higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate.       Quantities of proved reserves are estimated  based on economic  conditions, including oil and natural gas prices in existence at the date of assessment. Our                                         21 Denbury Resources Inc.  reserves and future cash flows may be subject to revisions based upon changes in economic  conditions,  including  oil and natural gas prices,  as well as due to production  results,  results of future  development,  operating and development costs and other  factors.  Downward  revisions  of our  reserves  could  have an adverse affect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES --------------------       See Item 1.  Business  - "Oil and Gas  Operations."  We also  have  various operating  leases for rental of office space,  office and field  equipment,  and vehicles.  See  "Off-Balance  Sheet Agreements - Commitments and Obligations" in Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of Operations,  and Note 10,  "Commitments and  Contingencies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the future minimum rental payments. Such information is incorporated herein by reference.  ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS --------------------------       We are  involved in various  lawsuits,  claims and  regulatory  proceedings incidental to our businesses,  including  those noted below.  While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings,  individually and in the aggregate,  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations or cash flows,  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility  of a  material  adverse  impact on our net  income in the period in which the ruling  occurs.  We provide  accruals for  litigation and claims if we determine that we may have a range of legal exposure that would require accrual. The estimate of the potential impact from the following legal proceedings on our financial position or overall results of operations could change in the future.       Along with two other  companies,  we have been named in a lawsuit styled J. Paulin Duhe, Inc. vs. Texaco, Inc., et al, Cause No. 101,227, filed in late 2003 in the 16th Judicial District Court, Division "E", Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, seeking  restoration to its original condition of property on which oil has been produced over the past 70 years.  The contract and tort claims by the plaintiffs allege  surface and  groundwater  damage of 26 acres that are part of our Iberia Field in Iberia Parish, Louisiana.  Recently, plaintiff's experts have initially alleged that clean-up of alleged  contamination of the property would cost $79.0 million,  although  settlement  offers by plaintiffs  have already been made for much  smaller  sums.  The  property was  originally  leased to Texaco,  Inc. for mineral development in 1934 and Denbury acquired its interest in the property in August 2000 from Manti Operating Company.  Discovery is currently underway,  and the April 2005 trial setting has been  continued to an  unspecified  date in the future.  We believe that we are indemnified by the prior owner,  which we expect to cover our exposure to most damages,  if any,  found to have occurred prior to the time that we purchased the property. We believe that the allegations of this lawsuit are subject to a number of  defenses,  are without  merit and we and the other defendants plan to vigorously  defend this lawsuit,  and if necessary,  we will seek indemnification from the prior owner.       On December 29, 2003,  an action styled Harry Bourg  Corporation  vs. Exxon Mobil  Corporation,  et al,  Cause No.  140749,  was filed in the 32nd  Judicial District Court,  Terrebonne  Parish,  Louisiana against Denbury and eleven other oil companies and their  predecessors  alleging  damage as the result of mineral exploration activities conducted by these oil and gas  operators/companies  over the last 60 years.  Plaintiff  has  asked for  restoration  of the  10,000  acre property  and/or  damages in claims  made under tort law and various oil and gas contracts.  The Bourg Corporation recently produced its first preliminary expert reports that allege damages of  approximately  $100.0 million  against  Denbury. Discovery is continuing in this case, with trial currently set for January 2006. We  believe  the  allegations  of this  lawsuit  are  without  merit and plan to vigorously defend this lawsuit along with the other defendants. No provision has been accrued in our financial statements.  ITEM 4.

Our Director  Compensation  Plan was adopted  effective  July 1, 2000 for a term of ten years. The Director Plan allows each  non-employee  director to make an annual  election  to receive  his or her  compensation  in either  cash or in shares of our common stock and to elect to defer  receipt of such  compensation, if they wish. We  anticipate  that the Director Plan will be modified in 2005 to no longer  allow  directors  to defer  receipt of such  compensation  due to the American  Jobs  Creation Act of 2004.  The number of shares issued to a director who  elects to  receive  shares  of common  stock  under  the  Director  Plan is calculated  by dividing  the  director  fees to be paid to such  director by the average  price of the  Company's  common stock for the ten trading days prior to the date the fees are payable.  Generally director's fees are paid quarterly. We have reserved 100,000 shares for issuance under the Director Plan, for directors who elect to receive their compensation in stock.

The Plan originally provided for purchases through an independent broker of 50,000  shares of  Denbury's  common  stock per fiscal  quarter  for a period of approximately  twelve months, or a total of 200,000 shares,  beginning August 13, 2003 and ending on July 31, 2004. In May 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the Plan for  another  year  beginning  July 1, 2004 and ending June 30, 2005,  covering  another  200,000  shares at the same 50,000  shares per quarter rate.  Purchases are to be made at prices and times determined at the discretion of the independent broker, provided however that no purchases may be made during the last ten business days of a fiscal quarter.                                          24 Denbury Resources Inc.

25 Denbury Resources Inc.  ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OF OPERATIONS -------------       We are a growing  independent  oil and gas company  engaged in acquisition, development and exploration activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We are the largest oil and natural gas producer in Mississippi, own the largest reserves of carbon  dioxide  ("CO2") used for tertiary oil recovery east of the  Mississippi River,  and hold  significant  operating  acreage  onshore  Louisiana and in the Barnett  Shale  play in Texas.  Our goal is to  increase  the value of  acquired properties  through  a  combination  of  exploitation,   drilling,   and  proven engineering  extraction  processes,  including  secondary and tertiary  recovery operations. Our corporate headquarters are in Plano, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), and we have two primary field offices located in Houma,  Louisiana,  and Laurel, Mississippi.  OVERVIEW       CONTINUED EXPANSION OF OUR TERTIARY OPERATIONS. Since we acquired our first carbon  dioxide  tertiary  flood in  Mississippi  over five years  ago,  we have gradually  increased our emphasis on these types of operations.  We particularly like  this  play  because  of its  risk  profile,  rate of  return  and  lack of competition in our operating area. Generally,  from East Texas to Florida, there are no known  significant  natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own, and these  large  volumes  of CO2 that we own drive the  play.  Please  refer to the section  entitled  "CO2  Operations"  for further  information  regarding  these operations, their potential, and the ramifications of this change in focus.       During the last few years,  we have  gradually  increased the percentage of our spending dedicated to CO2 and tertiary related  operations.  During 2002 and 2003, we spent around 25% of our capital budget on tertiary related items, spent approximately  46%  during  2004,  and we  further  emphasized  this part of our business by budgeting  over 60% of our initial 2005 capital  budget for tertiary operations.  We plan to spend approximately $190 million during 2005 on tertiary operations,  including  an  estimated  $45  million  for an 84-mile  pipeline to transport CO2 from our CO2 source fields  located near Jackson,  Mississippi  to our planned tertiary  recovery  operations in East  Mississippi,  an expenditure that may  ultimately  be  financed  with  sources  other than our cash flow.  We anticipate that the pipeline will be ready for use during the first half of 2006 to  commence  what we call  Phase II  (operations  in East  Mississippi)  of our tertiary  recovery  program  (see  "CO2  Operations").  Phase II will  initially consist of tertiary recovery operations at six oil fields in that region, but we ultimately  plan to expand these  operations  to several other oil fields in the area,  which  would  also be  serviced  by the new  pipeline.  Our  focus on CO2 tertiary  related  operations  is expected to impact our  financial  results and certain  operating  statistics.  See "Results of  Operations - CO2  Operations - Financial Statement Impact of CO2 Operations" below.       During 2004,  we drilled four CO2 wells which added an estimated 1.0 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves, resulting in total proved CO2 reserves at December 31, 2004 of  approximately  2.7 Tcf (2.1 Tcf to our net ownership - see "CO2 Operations - CO2  Resources").  We anticipate  that year-end 2004 proved CO2 reserves will be sufficient to satisfy the projected CO2  requirements for our first two tertiary operation phases, Phase I, our tertiary operations in Southwest Mississippi, and Phase II, our recently planned expansion into Eastern Mississippi.       Following the sale of our offshore  operations in July 2004, we updated our development  schedule and targeted oil production  from these tertiary  recovery operations.  Based on our current plans,  we anticipate  that we can continue to show significant  growth in our oil production from tertiary  operations for the next five to ten years from our  planned  Phase I and Phase II  operations.  The model assumes that the first  production  from tertiary  recovery  operations in Eastern  Mississippi  will occur in 2007.  During 2004, oil production  from our tertiary recovery operations averaged 6,784 BOE/d,  averaging 7,242 BOE/d during the fourth quarter.       SALE OF  OFFSHORE  OPERATIONS.  On July 20,  2004,  we  closed  the sale of Denbury  Offshore,  Inc., a subsidiary that held our offshore  assets,  for $200 million (before adjustments) to Newfield Exploration Company. The sale price was based on the asset value of the offshore assets as of April 1, 2004, which means that the net operating cash flow (defined as revenue less operating expenses and capital  expenditures) from these properties which we received between April 1st and closing, as well as expenses of the sale and other contractual  adjustments, reduced the purchase  price to  approximately  $187 million.  The purchaser also received  the net working  capital of Denbury  Offshore as of the closing  date, which primarily consisted of accrued production receivables.                                         26 Denbury Resources Inc.                      Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations       We excluded  two  significant  items from the sale:  (i) a  discovery  well drilled at High  Island A-6 during  2004 and (ii)  certain  deep  rights at West Delta 27. The well at High Island A-6 should be on  production  during the first half of 2005, and we sold a substantial portion of the deep rights at West Delta 27 during the third  quarter  of 2004 for $1.8  million  but  retained a carried interest in a deep exploratory well.       Our offshore  properties  made up  approximately  12% of our year-end  2003 proved reserves  (approximately 96 Bcfe as of December 31, 2003) and represented approximately 25% (9,114 BOE/d) of our 2004 second quarter production.       OPERATING RESULTS. As a result of the sale of our offshore properties early in the third quarter of 2004, our total  production was  significantly  reduced, contributing  to a 5% decline in  production  levels  during 2004 as compared to 2003  levels.  However,  higher  commodity  prices  more than  offset  the lower production,  resulting in net income of $82.4 million during 2004 as compared to $56.6 million of net income during 2003. The increase in adjusted cash flow from operations  during 2004 was less  significant  (5%)  primarily  due to the $21.0 million of income taxes paid  relating to the sale of our  offshore  properties. See "Results of Operations - Operating  Income" for  discussion of this non-GAAP measure versus cash flow from operations, which decreased by 15% between the two periods. Payments on our commodity hedges continued to be a significant outflow, totaling  $84.6  million for 2004,  up from $62.2  million  during  2003.  Hedge payments should drop significantly  during 2005 as most of our  out-of-the-money hedges  expired at December 31, 2004.  See  "Results of  Operations"  for a more thorough  discussion of our operating  results and "Market Risk  Management" for more  information  regarding  our hedge  position at  year-end  2004 and our new method of accounting for hedges for 2005.  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY       For 2005, our initial capital budget, excluding any potential acquisitions, is $305  million,  which at commodity  futures  prices as of the end of February 2005 will be slightly  more than  anticipated  cash flow from  operations.  That budget includes an estimated $45 million for a CO2 pipeline being constructed to East  Mississippi (see "Expansion of our tertiary  operations"  under "Overview" above),  which we may  refinance  upon  completion by entering into some sort of long-term  financing,  effectively paying for the cost of the pipeline over time and recouping the cash spent.  We monitor our capital  expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting them up or down depending on commodity prices and the resultant cash  flow.  Therefore,  during  the last few  years as  commodity  prices  have increased,  we have often increased our capital budget during the year and would likely do so again if commodity prices remain strong or increase further.       At year-end 2004, we had  approximately  $70 million in cash and short-term investments  remaining from the sale of our offshore properties,  over and above our normal  month-end cash  balances.  We plan to invest this remaining cash and any cash  potentially  generated from operations in excess of our capital budget (such amount being  highly  dependent on commodity  prices) over the next one to two years on property acquisitions, particularly those that have future tertiary potential.  Although we now control  most of the fields  along our  existing CO2 pipeline, there are several fields in East Mississippi that could be acquired to expand our planned  tertiary  operations  there,  plus we are continuing to seek additional interests in the fields that we currently own. Further, we would like to add additional phases or areas of tertiary  operations by acquiring other old oil fields in other parts of our region of  operations,  building a CO2 pipeline to those areas and initiating  additional  tertiary  floods.  We accelerated the pace and  expenditures on our tertiary  operations  following the offshore sale, and plan to continue to do so as long as it remains  economic and practical.  We also may seek conventional  development and exploration projects in our areas of operations or tertiary  operations in other areas of the country. In addition to our  cash  and  short-term  investments  which  may be used  for  the  potential aforementioned  projects, we have all of our bank credit line available to us if we were to need additional capital.       At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding $225 million (principal amount) of 7.5% subordinated  notes due in 2013,  approximately $4 million of capital lease commitments,  no bank debt, and working capital of $90 million.  On September 1, 2004, we amended and restated our bank credit agreement which modified the prior agreement  by (i)  creating  a  structure  wherein  the  commitment  amount  and borrowing base amount are no longer the same,  (ii) improving our credit pricing by reducing the interest rate  chargeable at certain levels of borrowing,  (iii) extending  the  term by three  years  to  April  30,  2009,  (iv)  reducing  the collateral  requirements,  (v)  authorizing up to $20 million of possible future CO2 volumetric production payment transactions with Genesis Energy ($4.8 million of  such   transactions   occurred  in  October  2004),  and  (vi)  other  minor modifications and corrections.  Under the new agreement,  our borrowing base was initially set at $200 million,  a $25 million  increase over the prior borrowing base of $175 million,  with an initial  commitment  amount of $100 million.  The borrowing  base  represents  the amount we can borrow  from a credit  standpoint based on our assets,  as confirmed by the banks,  while the commitment amount is the  amount we have asked the banks to commit to fund  pursuant  to the terms of                                         27 Denbury Resources Inc.                      Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  the credit agreement.  The banks have the option to participate in any borrowing request made by us in excess of the commitment  amount, up to the borrowing base limit,  although  they are not  obligated  to fund any  amount in excess of $100 million,  the  commitment  amount.  The  advantage  to us is that  we  will  pay commitment fees on the lower commitment  amount,  not the higher borrowing base, thus lowering our overall cost of available credit.  Sources and Uses of Capital Resources       During 2004, we spent $167.0 million on oil and natural gas exploration and development  expenditures,  $42.4  million on CO2  exploration  and  development expenditures,  and  approximately  $18.9 million on property  acquisitions,  for total capital  expenditures of approximately $228.3 million. Our exploration and development   expenditures  included   approximately  $138.9  million  spent  on drilling, $18.9 million of geological,  geophysical and acreage expenditures and $51.6  million  spent on  facilities  and  recompletion  costs.  We funded these expenditures with $168.7 million of cash flow from operations,  with the balance funded with net proceeds from the sale of our offshore properties.  We paid back all of our bank debt  during the third  quarter of 2004 with the  offshore  sale proceeds,  leaving us with approximately $33.0 million of cash and $57.2 million of short-term  investments  as of December 31, 2004. We also raised $4.8 million during the third quarter of 2004 from the sale of another volumetric  production payment  of CO2 to  Genesis  Energy,  L.P.  ("Genesis"),  along  with a  related long-term CO2 supply agreement with an industrial  customer.  Adjusted cash flow from operations (a non-GAAP measure defined as cash flow from operations  before changes  in  assets  and  liabilities  as  discussed  below  under  "Results  of Operations-Operating Results") was $200.2 million for 2004, while cash flow from operations, the GAAP measure, was $168.7 million.       During 2003, we generated  approximately  $197.6  million of cash flow from operations  and generated an additional  $29.4 million of cash from sales of oil and gas properties.  The largest single asset sale was the sale of Laurel Field, acquired from COHO in August 2002, which netted us approximately  $25.9 million. Later in the year,  we also sold a  volumetric  production  payment to  Genesis, which netted us  approximately  $23.9  million of cash.  During  2003,  we spent $146.6 million on oil and natural gas exploration and development  expenditures, $22.7 million on CO2 capital  investments and  acquisitions,  and  approximately $11.8  million on oil and natural gas property  acquisitions,  for total capital expenditures of  approximately  $181.1 million.  Our exploration and development expenditures  included  approximately  $115.3  million spent on drilling,  $15.7 million of geological,  geophysical and acreage  expenditures  and $35.2 million spent on facilities and recompletion costs. In addition, during 2003 we incurred approximately $15.6 million of costs for our subordinated debt refinancing.  The $147.3  million of net total  expenditures  (including the $15.6 million of debt refinancing  costs but net of property  sales  proceeds)  was funded by our cash flow  from  operations,  with the  balance  used to  reduce  our  total  debt by approximately $50.0 million.       During  2002,  we spent  approximately  $99.3  million on  exploration  and development activities, approximately $56.4 million on acquisitions (the largest being the $48.2 million  acquisition of the COHO properties),  and approximately $16.4 million on CO2 related capital expenditures,  for a total of approximately $172.1  million.   Our  exploration   and  development   expenditures   included approximately  $62.3  million spent on drilling,  $17.8  million of  geological, geophysical and acreage  expenditures  and $19.1 million spent on facilities and recompletion costs. The exploration and development  expenditures were funded by cash flow from operations,  and the  acquisitions  were primarily funded by cash flow,   supplemented  by  property   dispositions   totaling  $7.7  million  and incremental bank debt for the year of $9.1 million.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  Commitments and Obligations       We  have no  off-balance  sheet  arrangements,  special  purpose  entities, financing  partnerships or guarantees,  other than as disclosed in this section. We have no debt or equity triggers based upon our stock or commodity prices. Our dollar  denominated  obligations  that are not on our balance  sheet include our operating  leases,  which  at  year-end  2004  totaled  $21.6  million  relating primarily to the lease  financing  of certain  equipment  for our CO2  recycling facilities at our tertiary oil fields.  We also have several leases  relating to office  space and other minor  equipment  leases.  We also have  dollar  related                                         28 Denbury Resources Inc.                      Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  obligations  that are not currently  recorded on our balance  sheet  relating to various obligations for development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal capital  expenditure program or from other transactions common to our industry.  In addition,  in order to recover our undeveloped proved reserves, we must also fund the associated future  development costs forecasted in our proved reserve reports.  For a further  discussion of our future  development costs and proved  reserves,  see  "Results of  Operations -  Depletion,  Depreciation  and Amortization."       At December 31, 2004, we had a total of $460,000  outstanding in letters of credit.  Genesis Energy,  Inc., our 100% owned  subsidiary  which is the general partner of Genesis,  has guaranteed the bank debt of Genesis,  which consists of $15.3  million of debt and $22.8  million in letters of credit at  December  31, 2004.  There were no guarantees by Denbury or any of its other  subsidiaries  of the debt of Genesis or of Genesis  Energy, Inc. at December 31, 2004.  We do not have  any  material  transactions  with  related  parties  other  than  sales of production  and  transportation  arrangements  with Genesis made in the ordinary course of business,  and volumetric  production  payments of CO2 ("VPP") sold to Genesis as discussed in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The table assumes that our long-term debt is held until maturity.  (b)  Represents future minimum cash commitments  under capital leases in place at December 31, 2004,  primarily for      transportation of crude oil and CO2. Agreements are with Genesis. Approximately $2.2 million of these payments      represents interest.  (c)  Represents  future minimum cash  commitments  under contracts in place as of December 31, 2004,  primarily for      drilling  rig  services  and well  related  costs.  As is common in our  industry,  we commit to make  certain      expenditures on a regular basis as part of our ongoing development and exploration program.  These commitments      generally  relate to projects  that occur  during the  subsequent  several  months and are usually part of our      normal  operating  expenses or part of our capital  budget,  which for 2005 is  currently  set at $305 million      (including  the CO2 pipeline).  In addition,  we have  recurring  expenditures  for such things as accounting,      engineering and legal fees, software maintenance, subscriptions, and other overhead type items. Normally these      expenditures do not change  materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and      administrative  expenses.  We have not attempted to estimate these types of expenditures in this table as most      could be quickly cancelled with regard to any specific vendor,  even though the expense itself may be required      for ongoing normal operations of the Company.  (d)  Represents the estimated future payments under our derivative  obligations  based on the futures market prices      as of December 31,  2004.  These  amounts  will change as oil and natural gas  commodity  prices  change.  The      estimated  fair market value of our oil and natural gas commodity  derivatives at December 31, 2004 was a $4.9      million liability. See further discussion of our derivative contracts in "Market Risk Management" contained in      this Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and in Note 9 to the Consolidated  Financial      Statements.  (e)  Represents  projected  capital  costs as scheduled in our  December  31, 2004 proved  reserve  report that are      necessary  in order to  recover  our  proved  undeveloped  reserves,  but  these are not  current  contractual      commitments. Amount is net of capital obligations shown above.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations (f)  Represents the estimated  future asset retirement  obligations on an undiscounted  basis. The discounted asset      retirement  obligation of $21.5 million,  as determined under SFAS No. 143, is further  discussed in Note 4 to      the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Long-term  contracts  require  us to  deliver  CO2  to our  industrial  CO2 customers at various contracted prices,  plus we have a CO2 delivery  obligation to Genesis  pursuant to two volumetric  production  payments  ("VPP")  contracts entered into during 2003 and 2004. Based upon the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the contracts and the volumetric  production payment, we estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to 398 Bcf of CO2 to these  customers over the next 17 years;  however,  since the group as a whole has historically taken less CO2 than the maximum allowed in their  contracts,  based on the current level of deliveries  we  project  that  our   commitment   would  likely  be  reduced  to approximately  332  Bcf.  The  maximum  volume  required  in any  given  year is approximately  101 MMcf/d,  although  based on our current level of  deliveries; this would likely be reduced to approximately  78 MMcf/d.  Given the size of our proven CO2 reserves at December 31, 2004 (approximately 2.7 Tcf before deducting approximately  178.7 Bcf for the two VPPs), our current production  capabilities and our projected levels of CO2 usage for our own tertiary flooding program,  we believe that we will be able to meet these delivery obligations.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  CO2 Operations       OVERVIEW.  Over five years ago we began our focus upon tertiary  operations with the purchase of Little Creek Field, a tertiary recovery  operation that was already  underway.  Subsequently,  we have  greatly  expanded  this  program  in Southwest  Mississippi (Phase I of our tertiary  operations),  acquiring several more oil fields  and most  importantly  the CO2  resources  used to flood  these fields (see "CO2  Resources"  below).  The focus has increased to the point that approximately  60% of our 2005 capital  budget is dedicated to tertiary  related operations,  including the CO2 pipeline  currently  under  construction  to East Mississippi   (the  area  where  we  will  conduct  Phase  II  of  our  tertiary operations).  We  particularly  like this play as (i) it is lower  risk and more predictable than most traditional exploration and development  activities,  (ii) it provides a reasonable  rate of return at  relatively  low oil prices (down to prices in the low  twenties  per Bbl in Phase I of our  tertiary  operations  in Southwest Mississippi), and (iii) we have virtually no competition for this type of activity in our geographic area. Generally, from East Texas to Florida, there are no known  significant  natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own, and these large volumes of CO2 that we own drive the play.       CO2  RESOURCES.  In February  2001,  we acquired the sources of CO2 located near  Jackson,  Mississippi,  and a pipeline to  transport it to our oil fields. Since February 2001, we have acquired two producing  wells and drilled seven CO2 producing  wells,  tripling  our  initial  proven CO2  reserves to 2.7 Tcf as of December  31, 2004  (including  the 178.7 Bcf of reserves  dedicated to two VPPs with Genesis).  The estimate of 2.7 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves is based on total CO2 reserves in the fields,  of which  Denbury's net ownership is  approximately 2.1 Tcf and is included in the  evaluation  of proven CO2 reserves by DeGolyer & MacNaughton included as Exhibit 99. In discussing the available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved reserves as that is the amount that is available both for Denbury's  tertiary  recovery  programs and for industrial users who are  customers  of  Denbury  and  others,  as we are  responsible  for distributing  the entire CO2 production  stream for both of these  purposes.  We currently estimate that it will take approximately 711 Bcf of CO2 to develop and produce the proved tertiary  recovery  reserves we have recorded at December 31, 2004.       Today, we own every known producing CO2 well in the region,  providing us a significant  strategic  advantage  in the  acquisition  of other  properties  in Mississippi  and  Louisiana  that could be further  exploited  through  tertiary recovery.  As of January  2005,  we are capable of producing  approximately  350 MMcf/d of CO2,  about  four  times the  production  capacity  at the time of our initial  acquisition of the Jackson Dome field. We continue to drill  additional CO2 wells,  with four more wells planned for 2005, which are expected to further increase  our  production  capacity  and  potentially  increase  our  proven CO2 reserves. We believe we have sufficient CO2 reserves for our first two phases of tertiary  operations in Western Mississippi and Eastern  Mississippi,  but would like to add  additional  reserves  for  future  phases,  plus we need to further increase  our  production  capacity  as our  current  model for  phases I and II requires  almost 700 MMcf/d of CO2 production by 2009.  Although we believe that our plans and projections  are reasonable and achievable,  there could be delays or  unforeseen  problems in the future  which  could delay our overall  tertiary development  program.  We  believe  that such  delays,  if any,  should  only be temporary.       In addition to using CO2 for our tertiary operations,  we sell CO2 to third party industrial users under long-term contracts.  Our net operating margin from                                         30 Denbury Resources Inc.                      Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  these sales was $6.2 million  during 2002,  $6.5 million  during 2003,  and $4.9 million during 2004. Our average CO2 production  during 2002,  2003 and 2004 was approximately 104 million,  170 million,  and 218 million cubic feet per day, of which  approximately  54% in 2002,  62% in 2003, and 73% in 2004 was used in our tertiary  recovery  operations,  with  the  balance  sold to third  parties  for industrial use.       We spent  approximately  $0.12  per Mcf to  produce  our CO2  during  2004, slightly  less than our 2003 annual  average of $0.15 per Mcf,  primarily due to the lack of any  significant  workover  expenses like we had in 2003,  partially offset by higher royalty  expenses because certain of our royalties are adjusted based on oil  prices.  During  2002,  we spent  approximately  $0.13  per Mcf to produce our CO2. Our estimated  total cost per thousand cubic feet of CO2 during 2004 was approximately  $0.21,  after inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to the CO2 production.       OIL POTENTIAL.  Although our oil production from our CO2 tertiary  recovery activities is still relatively modest  (approximately 25% of fourth quarter 2004 production), we expect it to be an ever increasing portion of our production. We currently have tertiary operations on-going at Little Creek,  Mallalieu,  McComb and Brookhaven  Fields,  as well as various smaller adjacent fields.  We project that our oil production from these operations will increase  substantially  over the next several years,  along with our tentatively  scheduled tertiary projects at other oil fields along our pipeline.  As of January  2005,  these fields were producing   approximately  8,300  Bbls/d.  As  of  December  31,  2004,  we  had approximately 50.5 MMBbls of proven oil reserves related to tertiary  operations in these  fields  along  our CO2  pipeline  and have  identified  and  estimated significant  additional  potential  in  fields  that  we own in  this  area.  In addition,   we  have  commenced  operations  to  expand  this  program  to  East Mississippi  and have commenced the acquisition of leases and  right-of-way  for the  construction of an 84-mile CO2 pipeline from our source wells near Jackson, Mississippi  to Eucutta Field in East  Mississippi.  While our current  tertiary operations in the Southwest part of Mississippi are economic at NYMEX per barrel oil prices in the low twenties, due predominately to the lower quality of oil in East  Mississippi,  we estimate that it requires a NYMEX oil price in the mid to upper twenties for the same rate of return in this part of the state. We believe that this expansion,  labeled Phase II, has significant other oil potential well beyond the first six fields that we have engineered and currently plan to flood. Combining  the  production  forecast for both of these areas  extends the period during which we anticipate  significant oil production  growth from a few years, for  Phase I  alone,  to five  to ten  years  combined.  While  it is  extremely difficult to  accurately  forecast  production,  we do believe that our tertiary recovery operations provide significant long-term production growth potential at reasonable  rates of return with relatively low risk and will be the backbone of our Company's growth for the foreseeable future.       FINANCIAL  STATEMENT IMPACT OF CO2 OPERATIONS.  The increasing  emphasis on CO2 tertiary recovery projects has made, and will continue to make, an impact on our  financial   results  and  certain  operating   statistics   different  from conventional development activities.       First,   there  is  a  significant   delay  between  the  initial   capital expenditures  and  the  resulting  production   increases,   as  these  tertiary operations  require the building of facilities  before CO2 flooding can commence and it usually takes  six-to-twelve  months before the field  responds (i.e. oil production  commences) to the injection of CO2.  Further,  as we expand to other areas beyond Phase I, there will be times when we spend  significant  amounts of capital  before we can recognize any proven  reserves as these other areas,  for the most part,  will require an oil  production  response to the CO2  injections before any oil reserves  can be  recorded.  We plan to spend over $50 million on Phase II oil fields  during  2005,  plus an  additional  $45  million on the CO2 pipeline to East Mississippi.       Secondly,  these  tertiary  projects are more expensive to operate than our other  oil  fields  because  of the  cost of  injecting  and  recycling  the CO2 (primarily due to the  significant  energy  requirements  to re-compress the CO2 back into a liquid state for  re-injection  purposes).  As commodity  and energy prices increase,  so does our operating  expenses in these fields.  As such, our overall  operating  expenses on a per BOE basis will likely continue to increase as  these  operations  constitute  an  increasingly  larger  percentage  of  our operations.  Our operating cost for our tertiary operations during 2004 averaged $9.90 per BOE, as compared to an estimated cost of around $5 to $7 per BOE for a more traditional oil property. We allocate the cost to produce and transport the CO2 between CO2 used in our own oil fields and CO2 sold to commercial users. The CO2  operating  expenses  allocated  to our oil  fields  are  recorded  as lease operating expenses on those fields.       Third,  all of our current CO2  operations are in fields that produce light sweet oil and receive oil prices close to, and sometimes  actually  higher than, NYMEX  prices.  As this  production  becomes a larger  percentage of our overall production,  the overall  average  difference  between the prices we receive and published NYMEX prices should decrease,  assuming other market conditions do not                                         31 Denbury Resources Inc.                      Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  change. While our oil prices have historically  averaged between $4.00 and $5.00 below NYMEX prices,  our 2002 average was $3.74 below NYMEX and our 2003 average decreased  further to $3.60 below NYMEX.  During  2004,  the market for sour and heavy crude oil  (predominately our East Mississippi  production)  deteriorated, causing our overall average differential to increase to $4.91 per barrel for the year and to $6.48 per  barrel for the  fourth  quarter of 2004.  While we cannot predict  what will happen to the market for heavy and sour  crude,  we do expect our light sweet oil  production  to increase  as a  percentage  of our total oil production over the next few years.  However, this trend could reverse in future years as the anticipated oil production from Phase II of our tertiary operations is primarily heavy and sour oil.       2004 CO2 Tertiary Recovery  Operating  Activities.  Our oil production from our CO2 tertiary recovery  activities has steadily increased during the last few years,  from 3,970  Bbls/d in 2002 to 4,671  Bbls/d  during  2003,  and to 6,784 Bbls/d  during  2004,  with a fourth  quarter  2004 rate of 7,242  Bbls/d.  This represents  approximately  37% of our total corporate oil production  during the fourth quarter of 2004 and approximately  25% of our total corporate  production on a BOE basis.  We expect that this oil  production  will continue to increase, although the increases are not always predictable or consistent.       While we did  experience  higher  energy  costs  to  operate  our  tertiary recycling  facilities as a result of higher  commodity  prices,  we were able to lower our operating cost per BOE in our tertiary  operations from $11.34 per BOE in 2003 to  $9.90  per BOE  during  2004  because  of the  higher  tertiary  oil production  levels.  In addition to higher energy costs, we experienced  general cost inflation in the industry and also  commenced  lease payments on certain of our recycling facilities (see "Commitments and Obligations" above). As a result, the  absolute  amount of  operating  expenses  related  to  tertiary  operations increased  from $14.3 million during 2002 to $19.3 million during 2003 and $24.6 million during 2004.       At December 31, 2004, we had proved reserves of 50.5 MMBbls relating to our tertiary recovery operations. Through December 31, 2004, we had spent a total of $155.6  million on fields  involved in this  process,  and had  received  $160.0 million  in  net  cash  flow  (revenue  less  operating   expenses  and  capital expenditures),  or net  positive  cash  flow of $4.4  million.  The  proved  oil reserves in our CO2 fields have a PV-10 Value of $782.9 million,  using December 31, 2004 constant  NYMEX pricing of $43.45 per Bbl. These amounts do not include the capital costs or related  depreciation and amortization of our CO2 producing properties.  Through  December 31, 2004, we have spent a total of $132.8 million on our CO2 producing  properties,  received a total of $57.4 million in net cash flow  (revenue  less  operating  expenses and capital  expenditures,  consisting solely  of sales to  industrial  customers  and  Genesis  volumetric  production payment  receipts),  leaving  us a balance  of  approximately  $75.4  million of unrecovered costs for the CO2 assets.       CO2  Related  Capital  Budget  for  2005.  Tentatively,  we plan  to  spend approximately  $35 million in 2005 in the  Jackson  Dome area with the intent to add  additional  CO2  reserves  and   deliverability   for  future   operations. Approximately  $60 million in capital  expenditures  is budgeted in 2005 for our oil fields with tertiary  operations in Southwest  Mississippi and approximately $50 million for oil fields in East  Mississippi,  plus an additional $45 million for the CO2 pipeline to East  Mississippi,  increasing  our combined CO2 related expenditures to over 60% of our 2005 capital budget.  Operating Income       Cash flow from  operations  and net  income  have been  strong for the last three  years,  primarily  because of higher than  historical  commodity  prices. Production  declined  slightly (2%) from 2002 to 2003 and  approximately 5% from 2003 to 2004, with most of the current year decrease  related to the sale of our offshore properties (see also "Overview"). The higher commodity prices each year more than offset the production decline,  resulting in higher overall net income and  adjusted  cash flow from  operations  each year from 2002 through 2004 (see discussion  below  regarding  this  non-GAAP  measure,  adjusted  cash flow from operations).

Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Adjusted cash flow from  operations is a non-GAAP  measure that  represents cash flow provided by operations  before changes in assets and  liabilities,  as calculated  from our  Consolidated  Statements  of Cash  Flows.  Cash  flow from operations  is the GAAP measure as presented in our  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows.  In our  discussion  herein,  we have  elected to discuss  these two components of cash flow provided by operations.       Adjusted cash flow from operations, the non-GAAP measure, measures the cash flow  earned  or  incurred  from  operating  activities  without  regard  to the collection or payment of associated  receivables or payables. We believe that it is important to consider  adjusted cash flow from operations  separately,  as we believe it can often be a better way to discuss  changes in operating  trends in our business  caused by changes in  production,  prices,  operating  costs,  and related  operational  factors,  without regard to whether the earned or incurred item was  collected or paid during that year.  We also use this measure  because the collection of our  receivables or payment of our  obligations has not been a significant issue for our business, but merely a timing issue from one period to the next, with fluctuations generally caused by significant changes in commodity prices or significant changes in drilling activity.       The net change in assets and  liabilities  relating to  operations  is also important as it does require or provide additional cash for use in our business; however,  we prefer to discuss its effect  separately.  For  instance,  as noted above, during 2003, our accounts payable and accrued liabilities  increased as a result of our higher  drilling  activity  level  late in the year,  particularly offshore,  increasing our available cash from operations.  During 2004, we had a $31.5 million  difference between our adjusted cash flow from operations and our GAAP cash flow from operations.  The most significant factor was the transfer of approximately  $12.5 million of accrued production  receivables  relating to our offshore properties that existed as of the closing date to the offshore property purchaser.  This reduction in accrued production receivables during 2004 was not considered a collection of receivables  for our GAAP cash flow from  operations. In  addition  to the  effect  of  transferred  receivables,  our  other  accrued production  receivables  increased  during  the  year  due  to the  increase  in commodity prices and we reduced our accounts payable and accrued  liabilities by approximately  $10.5  million,  as a  result  of  less  overall  activity  as of year-end,  both of which contributed to the significant  difference  between our 2004 adjusted cash flow and GAAP cash flow from operations.                                            33 Denbury Resources Inc.

Adjusting for the offshore sale,  overall production increased  approximately 5% on a BOE/d basis during both 2003 and 2004, anchored by the increased production from our tertiary operations and Barnett Shale play, generally  offset  by  overall  declines  in our  onshore  natural  gas wells in Louisiana.  However,  other factors that caused fluctuations between the various periods should also be noted as outlined below.       The  addition  of   properties   acquired  from  COHO  during  August  2002 contributed  to the  majority of the increase in our overall  production  in the Mississippi-non-CO2  flood  properties  from  2002 to  2003,  as  most of  these pre-existing  non-CO2  fields in  Mississippi  have been on a slow  decline as a result of normal  depletion.  Heidelberg Field, our single largest field that is located in this area,  has  partially  offset this  decline,  as its  production increased each year,  from 7,479 BOE/d during 2002 to 7,535 BOE/d during 2003 to 7,775 BOE/d during 2004.  Most of this increase at Heidelberg is attributable to additional natural gas drilling in the Selma Chalk formation as Heidelberg's oil production  has been slowly  decreasing.  Natural gas  production  at this field averaged 7.1 MMcf/d in 2002, 10.3 MMcf/d in 2003 and 13.8 MMcf/d in 2004, making Heidelberg Field our single largest natural gas producing field during 2004.       As more fully discussed in "CO2 Operations"  above, oil production from our tertiary operations has increased each year.       Production from our offshore  properties  averaged 1,885 BOE/d in the third quarter,  representing the production  during the first 19 days of July prior to the  sale.  As  evidenced  in the  above  table,  production  from this area has fluctuated  over the last three years primarily due to the level of activity and the fluctuations caused by the short-lived nature of these natural gas reserves. As an example,  offshore  production  increased  in early 2004 as a result of 15 well  completions  made late in the fourth quarter of 2003, four at Brazos A-21, three at North Padre A-9, three at Chandeleur  Sound 69, two at West Cameron 192 and three at West Cameron  427.  Some of our natural gas  properties  in onshore Louisiana  have  similar  characteristics  as is evident  by the steep  declines during 2004. While the production from onshore  Louisiana only declined 7% on an annual  basis,  there was a 19% drop between the first  quarter of 2004 and last quarter of 2004. A significant  portion of this decline was at Thornwell  Field, an onshore  Louisiana field,  which averaged 926 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2004,  down from 2,526  BOE/d in the first  quarter  of 2004 and 2,487  BOE/d during  2003.  Production  from  this  field  is in a steep  decline  due to its short-lived  nature,  and is expected to further decline in the future. In spite of its short  remaining  life, we have  generated a good return on investment at Thornwell,  generating  $37.0  million  of net  positive  cash  flow  (operating revenues less operating expenses and capital  expenditures) through December 31, 2004,  with a  remaining  PV-10 Value of $37.4  million as of December  31, 2004 (based on SEC proved reserve report at year-end 2004 prices).                                         35 Denbury Resources Inc.                      Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Production in the Barnett Shale area has just recently begun to increase as a result of five horizontal  wells drilled and completed in this area during the latter  part of 2004.  We plan to drill  around 25 more wells  there in 2005 and expect production from this area to further increase during 2005.       Our production for 2004 was weighted  slightly  toward oil (58%),  although the fourth  quarter 2004 average was 68% oil  following the sale of the offshore properties  in July 2004.  It appears  that we will  remain  similarly  weighted toward oil in 2005 due to our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations, unless we make an acquisition that is predominantly natural gas.       OIL AND  NATURAL  GAS  REVENUES.  Our oil and  natural  gas  revenues  have increased  for each of the last two  years.  Two  factors  cause  the  change in pre-hedging revenues:  commodity prices and production levels.  Between 2003 and 2004,  revenues  increased by 15%, primarily due to higher commodity prices. The overall  increase in commodity  prices  contributed  $77.8 million in additional revenues,  a 20%  increase;  partially  offset by an overall  decrease  of $18.5 million (a 5% decrease) related to the 5% lower production volumes. Between 2002 and 2003,  revenues  increased by 40%, also  primarily  due to higher  commodity prices.  The overall increase in commodity prices  contributed $117.3 million in additional revenues, a 43% increase;  partially offset by an overall decrease in revenues  of $6.7  million (a 2%  decrease)  related to the 2% lower  production volumes.       During 2004,  we paid out $64.1  million on our oil hedges  ($9.10 per Bbl) and $20.4  million  ($0.68 per Mcf) on our natural gas hedges  relating to swaps and collars we purchased  one to two years  earlier when  commodity  prices were lower. About $30.5 million of the hedge payments related to swaps originally put in place to protect the rate of return for the COHO  acquisition in August 2002. The  payments in 2003 were  similar in nature,  but  slightly  less due to lower overall  commodity  prices.  During 2003,  we paid out $20.3  million on our oil hedges  ($2.95 per Bbl) and $41.9  million  ($1.21 per Mcf) on our  natural  gas hedges on generally  the same swaps and collars.  During 2002,  we had total net receipts on our hedges of $932,000,  paying out $0.6 million  ($0.09 per Bbl) on our oil hedges, but collecting a net $1.5 million ($0.04 per Mcf) on our natural gas  hedges.  For  2005,  we have  hedged  a  lower  percentage  of our  overall production,  predominately  with puts or price floors, so we anticipate that our hedge payments will be  substantially  lower than the payments made in 2004. See "Market Risk Management" for a further  discussion of our hedging activities and position.       Our net oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated as outlined on the prior table.  During 2004, we received the highest  weighted average net price per BOE in our history, netting $29.87 per BOE even after paying out approximately $7.01 per BOE for hedge losses. This resulted from average NYMEX prices of over $41.00 per Bbl and $6.00 per MMBtu  during the year.  Prices  were also  strong  during 2003,  although not quite as high,  netting  Denbury  $25.52 per BOE, net of the $4.91 per BOE hedge  losses.  During 2003 we also had one of our best years with regard to our  realized net price  relative to NYMEX  prices.  During  2002,  we received an average discount to NYMEX of $3.74 per Bbl. This improved in 2003 to an average  discount  of $3.60 per Bbl.  This trend was  reversed in 2004 as the heavy, sour crude market (which predominately applies to our Eastern Mississippi production) deteriorated significantly, increasing our average oil differentials for the year to $4.91 per Bbl and $6.48 per Bbl for the fourth  quarter of 2004. If market  conditions for the heavy,  sour crude remained  consistent,  we would expect to gradually  improve the overall  NYMEX  discount as the amount of light sweet oil  production  from our  tertiary  operations  is expected to  increase, improving the overall quality of our product mix.  However,  as evident in 2004, the oil market can change substantially.       Year over year,  there is  generally  less  fluctuation  in our natural gas prices  relative to NYMEX.  Normally,  we are at, or slightly  above,  the NYMEX market,  primarily because of the high Btu content of our natural gas. For 2004, we had an average $0.02  premium to NYMEX,  a little less than the $0.18 premium during  2003,  but higher than the $0.05  discount in 2002.  As we increase  our emphasis on the Barnett Shale area in 2005, the overall price we receive for our natural  gas  could  decline  slightly  as our  properties  in  this  area  have historically received a price that is $0.50 to $0.75 less than NYMEX prices.       OPERATING EXPENSES.  Lease operating expenses increased to $7.22 per BOE in 2004, a 2% increase over the $7.06 per BOE average  during 2003, and an increase of 32% from the $5.48 per BOE average  during 2002.  During  2004,  our workover expenses  decreased  as  compared  to 2003,  when we spent  $2.8  million on two individually  significant  workovers  relating  to  mechanical  failures  of two onshore Louisiana wells, plus several smaller  workovers.  Operating expenses on our  tertiary  operations  increased  from $14.3  million  during  2002 to $19.3 million in 2003 to $24.6  million in 2004 as a result of  increased  activity at Mallalieu and McComb Fields.  However, with the 45% higher production from these tertiary  operations  between  the  same  periods,  operating  expenses  for our tertiary  operations on a per BOE basis decreased from $11.34 per BOE in 2003 to $9.90  per BOE in  2004.  Nonetheless,  our  tertiary  operations  are  steadily increasing our aggregate dollar costs and our costs per BOE on a total corporate                                         36 Denbury Resources Inc.                      Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  basis as our tertiary  operations  constitute a more significant  portion of our total  production and operations.  The balance of cost increases  during 2004 is generally  attributable to higher energy costs to operate our tertiary  recovery properties,  a provision  for  potential  litigation  losses,  and general  cost inflation in our industry.  In general, we expect our operating costs per BOE to further increase in the future as the operating costs of our tertiary operations are higher than the costs of our other operations.       Most  of  the  increase  from  2002  to  2003  was   attributable   to  the aforementioned workovers, with several other smaller workovers, including one on a CO2 well. The growth of our tertiary operations also contributed to an overall increase,  as well as higher lease fuel costs and a full year of expenses on the properties acquired from COHO, which have typically had higher expenses on a per BOE basis than our other oil properties due to their age.       Production taxes and marketing  expenses  generally change in proportion to commodity  prices and therefore,  were higher in 2004 along with the record high commodity  prices.  The sale of our offshore  properties also contributed to the increase in production  taxes and  marketing  expenses on a per BOE basis during 2004, as most of our offshore properties were tax exempt.  General and Administrative Expenses       During the last three years, general and administrative ("G&A") expenses on a per BOE basis have  increased from $0.96 per BOE during 2002, to $1.20 per BOE during 2003, to $1.78 per BOE during 2004, increasing even faster than the gross aggregate  dollar  increases in G&A expense as production has declined each year due primarily to property sales.

The largest component of the increase was approximately $2.4 million of employee severance payments for the offshore  professional and technical staff terminated in conjunction with our offshore property sale. We also incurred  additional G&A expenses   associated  with  our  corporate   restructuring  in  December  2003, compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the sale of stock by the Texas  Pacific  Group in March 2004, a provision  for  potential  litigation losses,  restricted stock grants, higher bonus levels for employees than in 2003 due to the strong  performance  during 2004, and overall increases in most other categories of G&A due to general cost inflation.       During  the  third  and  fourth  quarters  of 2004,  we  granted a total of 1,150,000  million  shares of restricted  stock to our officers and  independent directors,  generating  deferred  compensation  expense of  approximately  $23.3 million,  the market value of the shares on the date of grant. A portion of this restricted  stock  vests  over  five  years  and a smaller  portion  vests  upon retirement  (in  addition  to  vesting  upon  death,  disability  or a change of control).  We are amortizing the non-cash $23.3 million of compensation  expense of this  restricted  stock  over  the  five  year  vesting  period  and over the projected retirement date vesting period,  expensing  approximately $1.6 million during 2004. We estimate that amortized  compensation expense for the restricted stock will be approximately $1.0 million per quarter through 2006.       Gross aggregate dollar G&A expenses increased $5.9 million, or 15%, between 2002 and 2003.  The largest  component of the increase  was  approximately  $1.4 million of expenses  spent for  consultants  hired to help document and test our system of internal  controls,  a requirement of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The second largest source of the increase was  approximately  $630,000 of legal, accounting,  bank and other fees  associated  with the  conversion  to a holding                                         37 Denbury Resources Inc.                      Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  company  organizational   structure  during  December  2003  which  reduced  our franchise  taxes  by  $565,000   between  2003  and  2004.  Other  factors  also contributed to the increase, the most significant being expenses associated with the sale of stock by the Texas  Pacific  Group in the first and last quarters of 2003,  higher  year-end  expenses for engineering and audit fees, and an overall increase in  personnel  and  associated  expenses  primarily  related to cost of living salary increases. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in our 2003 bonuses due to less positive  operating  results during 2003 in certain areas.       Higher operator  overhead  recovery charges  resulting from the incremental development  activity  helped to  partially  offset the  increase  in gross G&A, partially  reduced  by the  impact  of the  offshore  property  sale.  Our  well operating agreements allow us, when we are the operator, to charge a well with a specified  overhead rate during the drilling  phase and also to charge a monthly fixed  overhead  rate for each  producing  well.  As a result of the  additional operated wells from acquisitions,  additional tertiary operations,  and drilling activity  during the past year,  the amount we  recovered  as operator  overhead charges  increased  by 12% between  2002 and 2003 and 5% between  2003 and 2004. Capitalized  exploration  costs increased  slightly between 2002 and 2003, along with increases in employee  related costs,  but decreased in 2004 as a result of the personnel  reductions in our offshore area as a result of the property sale. The net  effect  of the  increases  in gross  G&A  expenses,  operator  overhead recoveries  and  capitalized  exploration  costs was a 41%  increase  in net G&A expense  between  2003 and 2004 and a 22% increase  between  2002 and 2003.  The increase  was even  higher on a per BOE  basis as a result of lower  production, primarily related to the offshore property sale.

Interest  expense  for 2004  decreased  from  2003  primarily  due to lower average debt levels as a result of our $50 million reduction in debt during 2003 and the payoff of our bank debt in the third  quarter of 2004 with the  proceeds from our offshore property sale. Our non-cash interest expense in 2004 decreased as a result of the subordinated debt refinancing in March 2003, which eliminated the amortization of discount on our old subordinated debt, which was higher than the  discount  and  related  amortization  on our new  subordinated  debt issue. Interest and other income  increased as a result of the cash  generated from the offshore property sale.       Interest  expense  for 2003  decreased  from  levels in the prior  year for similar  reasons,  (i) lower overall  interest rates,  resulting from an overall drop in market interest rates on our bank debt and due to the refinancing of our subordinated  debt, (ii) lower average  outstanding debt balance during 2003, as we reduced  debt by $50 million  during the year,  and (iii)  reduced debt issue cost amortization  resulting from the complete  amortization of costs associated with the  original  maturity of our bank  credit line in December  2002 after we refinanced and extended the bank credit line to April 2006.                                          38 Denbury Resources Inc.

Our proved reserves decreased from 130.7 MMBOE as of  December  31,  2002,  to 128.2  MMBOE as of  December  31, 2003 and increased  slightly to 129.4 MMBOE as of December 31, 2004.  During 2003 we sold approximately  8.3 MMBOE of proved  reserves and during 2004 sold  approximately 16.5 MMBOE of proved reserves,  primarily related to the offshore sale.  Reserve quantities  and  associated  production  are only one side of the DD&A equation, with capital  expenditures,  asset  retirement  obligations less related salvage value,  and projected  future  development  costs making up the remainder of the calculation.       In total,  our DD&A rate on a per BOE basis  increased  8% between 2003 and 2004,  primarily  due to the  higher  percentage  of  expenditures  on  offshore properties  during  2003 and the first six  months of 2004,  which  have  higher overall finding and development  costs, and an increase in certain of our future development cost estimates to reflect the rising costs in the industry. Although the 2004  average DD&A rate was similar to the DD&A rate of $8.00 per BOE during the fourth quarter of 2003, during the year there were significant fluctuations. Our DD&A rate on a per BOE basis decreased in the third quarter of 2004 to $7.62 per BOE from $8.46 per BOE in the second  quarter,  primarily as a result of the sale of our offshore properties, the proceeds of which were credited to the full cost pool.  However,  the rate  increased in the fourth quarter of 2004 to $7.98 per BOE,  primarily to reflect cost  inflation in the industry,  as we increased our cost estimates (i.e. future  development  costs) for certain existing proved undeveloped  reserves. We adjust our DD&A rate each quarter based on any changes in our  estimates of oil and natural gas  reserves and costs,  and thus our DD&A rate could  change  significantly  in the future.  Our DD&A rate for our CO2 and other fixed assets increased in 2004 as a result of the additional cost incurred drilling  CO2 wells  during the year and higher  associated  future  development costs,  partially  offset  by an  increase  in CO2  reserves  from 1.6 Tcf as of December  31, 2003 to 2.7 Tcf as of December  31,  2004 (100%  working  interest basis before amounts  attributable to Genesis volumetric  production  payments - see "CO2 Operations - CO2 Resources").       During  2003,  the fourth  quarter  DD&A rate  increased  to $8.00 per BOE, increasing  the 2003  annual  average  to $7.48  per BOE.  The  higher  DD&A was partially  due to the higher  percentage  of capital  expenditures  spent on our offshore  properties,  34% during 2003 as compared to  approximately  10% during 2002, where we have a higher overall finding cost. The rate was also affected by less  than  hoped  for  drilling  results  in the Gulf of  Mexico  and  Southern Louisiana,  particularly  in the  fourth  quarter,  where  some  of  our  larger exploration  potential  failed  to  materialize.  In  contrast  to our  offshore properties, our tertiary operations have yielded a finding and development cost, including the net change in forecasted future development and abandonment costs, of just under $6.00 per BOE  inception to December  31,  2004,  in line with our long-term  expectations,  helping to  partially  offset the higher  finding  and development cost of our offshore and other natural gas properties.       Prior  to  2003,  we  provided  for  the  estimated  future  costs  of well abandonment  and  site  reclamation,  net  of  any  anticipated  salvage,  on  a unit-of-production  basis.  This  provision  was  included  in DD&A  expense and increased  each  year,  along  with a  general  increase  in the  number  of our properties,  especially the  acquisition of our offshore  properties.  Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 143,  "Accounting for Asset Retirement  Obligations."  SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair  value  of a  liability  for an  asset  retirement  obligation  be recorded in the period in which it is incurred,  discounted to its present value using our credit  adjusted  risk-free  interest rate,  and that a  corresponding amount  be  capitalized  by  increasing  the  carrying  amount  of  the  related                                         39 Denbury Resources Inc.                      Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations   long-lived  asset.  The liability is accreted each period,  and the  capitalized cost is depreciated  over the useful life of the related asset. If the liability is settled for an amount  other than the  recorded  amount,  the  difference  is recorded to the full cost pool, unless significant. As part of this adoption, we ceased  accruing  for site  reclamation  costs,  as had been our practice in the past, and recorded a $41.0 million liability  representing the estimated present value of our retirement  obligations,  with a $34.4 million  increase to oil and natural gas properties.  On an  undiscounted  basis, we estimated our retirement obligations  as of December  31,  2003 to be $82.7  million,  with an  estimated salvage value of $43.3 million,  also on an  undiscounted  basis. As of December 31, 2004, we estimated our  retirement  obligations  to be $52.1 million  ($21.5 million present  value),  with an estimate  salvage value of $43.6 million,  the decrease related to the sale of our offshore  properties.  DD&A is calculated on the increase to oil and natural gas and CO2 properties, net of estimated salvage value.  We also  include  the  accretion  of  discount  on the asset  retirement obligation in our DD&A expense.       Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation.  We did not have any full cost pool ceiling test write downs in 2002,  2003 or 2004 and do not expect to have any such  write  downs in the foreseeable future at current commodity price levels.

Our tax  provision for 2002 and 2003 was based on an estimated  statutory rate of 38%. Our net effective tax rate for all periods was lower than the statutory rates, primarily due to the recognition of enhanced oil recovery credits which lowered our overall tax rate. The current income tax expense  represents our  anticipated  alternative  minimum cash taxes that we could not offset with our regular tax net operating  loss  carryforwards or our enhanced  oil  recovery  credits.  During the third  quarter of 2004,  we recognized  approximately  $21.0 million of current  income taxes as a result of the sale of our offshore  properties,  which was a gain for income tax purposes. The taxes on the offshore sale were  primarily  alternative  minimum taxes as we were  able to  offset  the  related  regular  tax  with our net  operating  loss carryforwards.  As of December 31, 2004,  we had utilized all of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards, but had an estimated $27.8 million of enhanced oil  recovery  credits to  carryforward.  Since the  ability to earn  additional enhanced oil recovery  credits is reduced or even eliminated  based on the level of oil prices,  our effective tax rate and cash taxes could both increase in the future if oil prices remain at current levels or increase further.       Our overall  current income tax credit for 2002 was the result of a tax law change that allowed us to offset 100% of our 2001 alternative minimum taxes with our alternative minimum tax net operating loss  carryforwards.  Prior to the law change,  we were able to offset only 90% of our  alternative  minimum taxes with these  carryforwards.  This  change  resulted in a refund of cash taxes paid for 2001 and a  reclassification  of tax expense between current and deferred taxes, but did not impact our overall effective tax rate.                                         40 Denbury Resources Inc.

We enter  into  various  financial  contracts  to  hedge  our  exposure  to commodity  price risk  associated  with  anticipated  future oil and natural gas production. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  These contracts have historically  consisted of price floors, collars and fixed  price  swaps.  Historically,  we have  generally  attempted  to hedge between 50% and 75% of our anticipated production each year to provide us with a reasonably certain amount of cash flow to cover most of our budgeted exploration and development  expenditures  without incurring  significant debt, although our hedging percentage may vary relative to our debt levels. For 2005 and beyond, we have  hedged  significantly  less,  primarily  because of our  strong  financial position  resulted  from our lower levels of debt relative to our cash flow from operations.  When we make a  significant  acquisition,  we generally  attempt to hedge a large  percentage,  up to 100%, of the forecasted  proved production for the  subsequent  one to three years  following the  acquisition in order to help provide  us with a minimum  return  on our  investment.  Much of our  historical hedging activity has been done with collars,  although for the COHO acquisition, we  also  used  swaps  in  order  to  lock in the  prices  used in our  economic forecasts. For 2005, all of our oil hedges are puts or price floors, allowing us to retain any price  upside,  while still  providing  protection in the event of lower prices at a fixed and  determinable  price (i.e.  the cost of the put). We anticipate  using more price  floors in the  future.  All of the  mark-to-market valuations used for our financial  derivatives are provided by external  sources and are based on prices that are actively  quoted.  We manage and control market and counterparty  credit risk through  established  internal control  procedures                                         41 Denbury Resources Inc.                      Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  that are  reviewed  on an ongoing  basis.  We attempt to  minimize  credit  risk exposure  to   counterparties   through  formal  credit   policies,   monitoring procedures, and diversification.  For a full description of our hedging position at year-end 2004, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Upon reaching a verbal agreement with the purchaser  (Newfield  Exploration Company) of our offshore  properties,  subject  primarily  to their  further due diligence,  we  entered  into  natural  gas swaps on a total of 23.6 Bcf for the period of July 2004 through December 2005,  covering the anticipated natural gas production  from our  offshore  properties  for  that  period,  with  the  tacit understanding  with  the  prospective  purchaser  that  these  hedges  would  be transferred  to them  upon  closing.  These  swaps  did not  qualify  for  hedge accounting  and during the third  quarter of 2004, we assigned them to Newfield. During the period that we owned them, we recognized  approximately  $2.5 million of gain as the hedges  appreciated in value before we assigned them to Newfield. At about the same time, with the expectation that the offshore transaction would be consummated, we retired, by purchasing offsetting contracts, 20 MMcf/d of our natural gas hedges for July to December of 2004, at a cost of approximately $3.9 million.  This  transaction,  net of the related gain on the hedges  assigned to Newfield,  was the  primary  reason for the $1.3  million net charge to earnings during  2004  relating  to our  derivative  contracts  that were not part of the monthly cash settlements on our derivatives contracts.       At December 31, 2004, our derivative  contracts were recorded at their fair value,  which was a net liability of approximately  $4.9 million,  a decrease of approximately $39.7 million from the $44.6 million fair value liability recorded as of December 31, 2003.  This change is the result of the expiration of most of our  derivative  contracts  during  2004 due to the  passage of time.  Effective January 1,  2005,  we have  elected  to  de-designate  our  existing  derivative contracts  as hedges  and to account  for them as  speculative  contracts  going forward.  This  means that any  changes  in the fair  value of these  derivative contracts  will be charged to earnings on a quarterly  basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings. Information  regarding  our current  hedging  positions and  historical  hedging results is included in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Based on NYMEX crude oil futures  prices at December 31, 2004,  prices were considerably  higher than the floor  price of $27.50,  so we would not expect to receive any funds even if oil prices were to drop 10%.  Since the oil hedges are puts or  price  floors,  we do not  have  to make  any  payments  on the  hedges regardless  of how high oil prices would go. Based on NYMEX  natural gas futures prices at December  31, 2004,  we would  expect to make future cash  payments of $4.2 million on our natural gas commodity  hedges. If natural gas futures prices were to decline by 10%,  the amount we would expect to pay under our natural gas commodity  hedges would decrease to $0.8 million,  and if futures prices were to increase by 10% we would expect to pay $7.6 million.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES       The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally accepted  accounting  principles  requires  that we  select  certain  accounting policies and make certain  estimates and judgments  regarding the application of those policies.  Our significant  accounting  policies are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the underlying assumptions  and  judgments  by our  management  in  their  application,  have a significant  impact on our  consolidated  financial  statements.  Following is a discussion   of  our  most   critical   accounting   estimates,   judgments  and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements.  Full Cost Method of Accounting,  Depletion and  Depreciation and Oil and Natural Gas Reserves       Businesses  involved in the  production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. We apply the  full-cost  method of  accounting  for our oil and natural  gas  properties. Another acceptable method of accounting for oil and gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting. In general, the primary differences between  the two  methods  are  related to the  capitalization  of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment.  Under the full-cost method, all geological and geophysical  costs,  exploratory  dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool,  whereas under the successful  efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred. In the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful efforts method follows the guidance of SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting for the  Impairment  or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets,"  under which assets are measured  for  impairment  against  the  undiscounted  future  cash flows  using commodity prices  consistent with management  expectations.  Under the full-cost method,  the full  cost  pool  (net  book  value of oil and gas  properties)  is measured  against  future cash flows  discounted at ten percent using  commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period. The financial results for a                                         42 Denbury Resources Inc.                      Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  given  period  could be  substantially  different  depending  on the  method  of accounting an oil and gas entity applies.       In our  application  of full cost  accounting for our oil and gas producing activities,  we make significant  estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and gas revenues,  production,  capitalized costs and operating expenses.  We calculate  these  estimates  with our best available  data,  which includes among other things,  production  reports,  price  posting,  information compiled from daily  drilling  reports and other internal  tracking  devices and analysis of historical results and trends.  While management is not aware of any required  revisions to its  estimates,  there will likely be future  adjustments resulting  from such things as changes in ownership  interests,  payouts,  joint venture audits,  re-allocations by the purchaser/pipeline,  or other corrections and adjustments  common in the oil and natural gas industry,  many of which will require retroactive application.  These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated  or  determined  and will be recorded in the period  during  which the adjustment  occurs.       Under full cost  accounting,  the  estimated  quantities  of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute  depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full-cost  ceiling test have a  significant  impact on the  underlying  financial  statements.  The process of estimating  oil and natural gas reserves is very  complex,  requiring significant   decisions  in  the   evaluation  of  all   available   geological, geophysical,  engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change  substantially  over  time as a result  of  numerous  factors,  including additional  development  activity,  evolving  production  history and  continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying  economic  conditions. As a result,  material  revisions to existing  reserve  estimates may occur from time to time.  Although  every  reasonable  effort  is made to  ensure  that the reported reserve  estimates  represent the most accurate  assessments  possible, including  the hiring of  independent  engineers  to  prepare  the  report,  the subjective  decisions  and variances in available  data for various  fields make these  estimates  generally  less precise than other  estimates  included in our financial  statement  disclosures.  Over the last four years,  Denbury's  annual revisions  to  its  reserve  estimates  have  averaged  approximately  3% of the previous year's estimates and have been both positive and negative.       Changes in  commodity  prices  also  affect  our  reserve  quantities.  For instance,  between  2001 and 2002,  commodity  prices  rebounded  from the prior year's fall, resulting in an increase to our reserve quantities of approximately 3.5 MMBOE.  During 2003 and 2004,  the change  related to  commodity  prices was virtually  zero,  less than in prior years,  as prices were  relatively  high at year-end 2002, 2003 and 2004.  These changes in quantities  affect our DD&A rate and the combined  effect of changes in quantities  and commodity  prices impacts our  full-cost  ceiling test  calculation.  For example,  we estimate  that a 5% increase in our estimate of proved  reserves  quantities  would have lowered our fourth quarter DD&A rate from $7.98 per Bbl to approximately $7.64 per Bbl and a 5% decrease in our proved reserve  quantities would have increased our DD&A rate to  approximately  $8.35 per Bbl.  Also,  reserve  quantities and their ultimate values are the primary  factors in determining the borrowing base under our bank credit facility and are determined solely by our banks.       There  can  also  be  significant  questions  as to  whether  reserves  are sufficiently  supported by technical  evidence to be considered  proven. In some cases  our  proven  reserves  are less  than what we  believe  to exist  because additional  evidence,  including  production  testing,  is  required in order to classify the reserves as proven.  In other cases,  properties such as certain of our potential  tertiary  recovery projects may not have proven reserves assigned to them  primarily  because  we have  not yet  completed  a  specific  plan  for development or firmly  scheduled such  development.  We have a corporate  policy whereby we generally do not book proved undeveloped  reserves unless the project has been  committed to internally,  which normally means it is scheduled  within the next one to three  years (or at least the  commencement  of the  project  is scheduled in the case of longer-term multi-year projects such as waterfloods and tertiary recovery  projects).  Therefore,  particularly with regard to potential reserves from tertiary recovery (our CO2 operations), there is uncertainty as to whether  the  reserves  should be  included  as  proven  or not.  We also have a corporate  policy  whereby  proved  undeveloped  reserves  must be  economic  at long-term  historical prices,  which during the last two years are significantly less than the year-end prices used in our reserve report. This also can have the effect of eliminating certain projects being included in our estimates of proved reserves,  which  projects would  otherwise be included if undeveloped  reserves were  determined to be economic  solely based on current  prices in a high price environment,  as  was  the  case  at  year-end  2003  and  year-end  2004.  (See "Depletion,  Depreciation and Amortization"  under "Results of Operations" above for a further discussion.) All of these factors and the decisions made regarding these issues can have a  significant  effect on our proven  reserves and thus on our DD&A rate, full-cost ceiling test calculation,  borrowing base and financial statements.                                         43 Denbury Resources Inc.                      Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Asset Retirement Obligations       We have significant  obligations related to the plugging and abandonment of our oil and gas wells,  and the removal of equipment and facilities  from leased acreage and returning such land to its original condition. SFAS No. 143 requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation,  discount it to its present value,  and  record a  corresponding  asset and  liability  in our  Consolidated Balance  Sheets.  The values  ultimately  derived are based on many  significant estimates,  including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation, the expected future date of the required  cash  payment,  and interest and  inflation  rates. Revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates, the timing of settlement,  and changes in legal  requirements.  Any such changes that result in upward or downward  revisions in the  estimated  obligation  will result in an  adjustment  to the  related  capitalized  asset and  corresponding liability on a prospective basis and an adjustment in our DD&A expense in future periods.  See  Note 4 to  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  further discussion regarding our asset retirement obligations.  Income Taxes       We make  certain  estimates  and  judgments in  determining  our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the  calculation  of  certain  tax  assets  and  liabilities   that  arise  from differences  in the timing and  recognition  of revenue  and expense for tax and financial  reporting  purposes.  Our  federal  and state  income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared,  therefore we estimate the tax basis of our assets and  liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate  changes,  tax credits and prior to  year-end  2004,  net  operating  loss  carryforwards.  Adjustments related to these  estimates  are recorded in our tax  provision in the period in which we file our income tax  returns.  Further,  we must assess the  likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our  deferred  tax assets  (primarily our enhanced oil recovery credits).  If recovery is not likely, we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover,  which would result in an increase to our income tax expense. As of December 31, 2004, we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet will ultimately be recovered. If our estimates and judgments  change  regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable.  A 1% change in our  effective  tax rate would have  increased our calculated  income  tax  expense  by  approximately  $1,200,000,  $800,000,  and $700,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. See Note 7 to the Consolidated  Financial Statements for further information concerning our income taxes.  Hedging Activities       We enter into derivative  contracts (i.e., hedges) to mitigate our exposure to commodity  price risk  associated with future oil and natural gas production. These  contracts have  historically  consisted of options,  in the form of price floors or collars,  and fixed price swaps.  With the adoption of SFAS No. 133 in 2001,  every  derivative  instrument  was required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either  an asset or a  liability  measured  at its fair  value.  If the derivative  does not  qualify as a hedge or is not  designated  as a hedge,  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized  currently in earnings.  If the  derivative  qualifies  for cash flow hedge  accounting,  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive  income (equity) to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective.  We recognized  ineffectiveness on our hedges of $600,000 for 2002, $282,000 for 2003 and $2.7 million for 2004.       With the significant  changes in commodity  prices over the last two years, the fair value of our hedges has  fluctuated  significantly.  While most of this change  in  value  is  recorded  in other  comprehensive  income  as most of our historical  hedges have  qualified for hedge  accounting,  the dramatic swing in commodity  prices and the  corresponding  effect on the fair value of our hedges can cause a dramatic  change to our balance sheet. In order to qualify for hedge accounting the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items must be highly  effective in  achieving  the offset of changes in fair values or cash flows  attributable  to the hedged risk, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing  basis.  We  measure  and  compute  hedge  effectiveness  on a quarterly basis. If a hedging instrument becomes  ineffective,  hedge accounting is  discontinued  and any deferred gains or losses on the cash flow hedge remain in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income until the periods during which the hedges would have otherwise  expired.  If we determine it probable that a hedged forecasted  transaction will not occur,  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings immediately.       Most  our  current  derivative  hedging   instruments   qualify  for  hedge accounting  although we plan to abandon hedge  accounting as of January 1, 2005. This  means  that any  changes  in the  future  fair  value of these  derivative contracts  will be charged to earnings on a quarterly  basis instead of charging                                         44 Denbury Resources Inc.                      Management's Discussion and Analysis of                   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings. For our three most  recently  completed  fiscal  years,  if we had not chosen to designate hedge accounting treatment to our oil and natural gas hedge contracts, or if none of our  derivative  contracts  had  qualified  for  hedge  accounting treatment,  we estimate that our net income would have  increased or (decreased) for 2004, 2003 and 2002 by the following amounts: $25.0 million,  $(7.8) million and $(38.5) million.       The preparation of financial statements requires us to make other estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues  and  expenses  during  each  reporting  period.  We  believe  that our estimates  and  assumptions  are  reasonable  and  reliable and believe that the ultimate  actual  results  will not differ  significantly  from those  reported; however,  such  estimates and  assumptions  are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS       On December 16, 2004,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No.  123(R),  which is a revision of SFAS No. 123.  SFAS No.  123(R) supersedes APB 25 and amends SFAS No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows."  Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123.  However,  SFAS  No.  123(R)  will  require  all  share-based  payments  to employees,  including grants of employee stock options,  to be recognized in our Consolidated  Statements of Operations based on their estimated fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.       SFAS No.  123(R)  must be adopted  no later  that July 1, 2005 and  permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods:       o    A  "modified   prospective"  method  in  which  compensation  cost  is           recognized  based  on the  requirements  of SFAS  No.  123(R)  for all           share-based  payments  granted prior to the effective date of SFAS No.           123(R) that remain unvested on the adoption date.      o    A "modified  retrospective"  method which includes the requirements of           the modified  prospective  method  described  above,  but also permits           entities  to  restate  either  all prior  periods  presented  or prior           interim  periods  of  the  year  of  adoption  based  on  the  amounts           previously  recognized  under SFAS No. 123 for  purposes  of pro forma           disclosures.       As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for share-based payments to employees using the intrinsic  value method  prescribed by APB 25 and related interpretations.  As such,  we generally do not recognize  compensation  expense associated  with employee stock options.  Accordingly,  the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)'s fair value method could have a significant  impact on Denbury's  future results of operations,  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position.  Had the Company  adopted SFAS No 123(R) in prior periods,  the impact would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the pro forma net income and earnings per share  disclosures  above.  The adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R) will have no effect on the  Company's  unvested  outstanding  restricted stock awards.  We currently  plan to adopt the  provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) on July 1,  2005  using  the  modified  prospective  method.  Although  we have not completed evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will have on our future  results of  operations,  we  currently  estimate the impact on an annual basis will be similar to our pro forma disclosures for SFAS No. 123 in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       SFAS No.  123(R) also  requires  the tax  benefits in excess of  recognized compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current  literature.  This requirement may serve to reduce the Denbury's  future cash provided by operating  activities and increase  future  cash  provided  by  financing  activities,  to the  extent  of associated  tax  benefits  that may be realized  in the future.  While we cannot estimate  what those amounts will be in the future  (because they depend,  among other things,  when employees  exercise stock options),  the amount of operating cash flows  recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $4.8 million, $1.3 million and $0.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.       In July 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the FASB issued EITF 04-05, "Investor's  Accounting  for an  Investment  in a Limited  Partnership  When the Investor  is the Sole  General  Partner and the Limited  Partners  Have  Certain Rights."  In question  is what  rights  held by the  limited  partners  preclude consolidation of the limited  partnership by the sole general partner.  The Task Force noted that in practice  differing views have evolved concerning this issue and it has asked the FASB staff to develop this issue for discussion at a future date.  Denbury is the general  partner of Genesis Energy,  L.P.  ("Genesis") and currently does not consolidate  Genesis in its financial results based primarily on certain rights of the limited partner. This EITF has been issued for comment, with the comment period ending in February 2005.  Based on our initial review of the  proposed  EITF,  we  currently  do not  believe  that  it will  impact  our consolidation  treatment of Genesis;  however,  this determination is subject to further  review and  evaluation of the final rules.  See Note 3, "Related  Party Transactions - Genesis" for further information  regarding Denbury's  accounting for its investment in Genesis.                                         45 Denbury Resources Inc.

Such forward-looking statements may be or may concern, among other things, forecasted capital expenditures,  drilling activity or  methods,  acquisition  plans and  proposals  and  dispositions,  development activities,  cost savings,  production rates and volumes,  hydrocarbon reserves, hydrocarbon  prices,  liquidity,   regulatory  matters,  mark-to-market  values, competition  and  long-term  forecasts of  production,  finding  cost,  rates of return,  estimated costs, future capital  expenditures and overall economics and other  variables  surrounding  our tertiary  operations  and future plans.  Such forward-looking  statements  generally are  accompanied by words such as "plan," "estimate," "expect," "predict," "anticipate,"  "projected," "should," "assume," "believe",  "target" or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Such forward-looking information is based upon management's current plans,  expectations,  estimates and  assumptions  and is subject to a number of risks  and  uncertainties  that  could   significantly   affect  current  plans, anticipated  actions,  the timing of such  actions and the  Company's  financial condition and results of operations. As a consequence, actual results may differ materially from expectations,  estimates or assumptions  expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ  materially are:  fluctuations of the  prices  received  or  demand  for the  Company's  oil and  natural  gas, inaccurate cost estimates, fluctuations in the prices of goods and services, the uncertainty  of  drilling  results  and reserve  estimates,  operating  hazards, acquisition  risks,  requirements  for  capital  or  its  availability,  general economic conditions, competition and government regulations,  unexpected delays, as well as the risks and  uncertainties  inherent  in oil and gas  drilling  and production  activities or which are otherwise  discussed in this annual  report, including,   without   limitation,   the  portions  referenced  above,  and  the uncertainties set forth from time to time in the Company's other public reports, filings and public statements.

Our system of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is a process  designed to provide reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation  of financial  statements for external  purposes in accordance  with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  Our internal control over financial reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that (i)  pertain  to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions of the assets of the Company;  (ii) provide reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded as  necessary to permit preparation  of financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;  and (iii) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.       Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal  control over  financial  reporting is a process  that  involves  human diligence  and  compliance  and is subject to lapses in judgment and  breakdowns resulting from human failures.  Internal  control over financial  reporting also can be circumvented  by collusion or improper  management  override.  Because of such  limitations,  there  is a risk  that  material  misstatements  may  not be prevented  or detected  on a timely  basis by internal  control  over  financial reporting.  However,  these  inherent  limitations  are  known  features  of the financial  reporting  process.  Therefore,  it is  possible  to design  into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.       Our  management  assessed the  effectiveness  of our internal  control over financial  reporting  as of December 31, 2004.  In making this  assessment,  our management   used  the  criteria  set  forth  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring Organizations  of  the  Treadway   Commission  in  INTERNAL   CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.  Based on our  management's  assessment,  we have  concluded that our internal control over financial  reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004 based on those criteria.       Our management's  assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control  over  financial  reporting  as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their audit report which appears herein.                                         47 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Denbury Resources Inc.:  We  have  completed  an  integrated  audit  of  Denbury  Resources  Inc.'s  2004 consolidated  financial  statements  and of its internal  control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Our opinions,  based on our audit, are presented below.  Consolidated financial statements ---------------------------------  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of Denbury  Resources  Inc. and its  subsidiaries  (the  "Company") at December 31, 2004,  and the  results  of their  operations  and their cash flows for the year ended  December 31, 2004 in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.  These  financial  statements  are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these  statements  in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material  misstatement.  An audit of financial statements includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Internal control over financial reporting -----------------------------------------  Also,  in our opinion,  management's  assessment,  included in the  accompanying "Management's  Report on Internal  Control over Financial  Reporting,"  that the Company  maintained  effective  internal control over financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway Commission  (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material  respects,  based on those criteria.  Furthermore,  in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria  established in Internal Control - Integrated  Framework issued by the COSO.  The Company's  management is  responsible  for  maintaining effective  internal  control over financial  reporting and for its assessment of the   effectiveness   of  internal   control  over  financial   reporting.   Our responsibility  is to express  opinions on  management's  assessment  and on the effectiveness of the Company's  internal control over financial  reporting based on our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit of  internal  control  over  financial reporting in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company  Accounting Oversight  Board  (United  States).  Those  standards  require  that we plan and perform  the  audit to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all  material respects.  An  audit of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting, evaluating  management's  assessment,  testing  and  evaluating  the  design and operating   effectiveness  of  internal  control,   and  performing  such  other procedures as we consider  necessary in the  circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A company's  internal control over financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions of the assets of the company;  (ii) provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;  and (iii) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  /s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP ------------------------------ Dallas, Texas March 14, 2005                                        48 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Stockholders of Denbury Resources Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Denbury Resources Inc. and  Subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of December 31, 2003, and the related consolidated  statements of  operations,  cash flows,  stockholders'  equity and comprehensive  income for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2003.  These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of the  Company's management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted  our audits in  accordance  with  standards  of the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our  opinion,  such  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2003, and the results  of its  operations  and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period  ended  December  31,  2003  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Organization and Nature of Operations       Denbury Resources Inc. is a Delaware corporation,  organized under Delaware General Corporation Law, engaged in the acquisition,  development, operation and exploration of oil and natural gas properties.  Denbury has one primary business segment, which is the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We also own the rights to a natural source of carbon  dioxide  ("CO2")  reserves that we use for injection in our tertiary oil recovery  operations.  We also sell some of the CO2 we produce to third  parties for various industrial uses.  Principles of Reporting and Consolidation       The  consolidated   financial  statements  herein  have  been  prepared  in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles  ("GAAP") and include the accounts of Denbury and its subsidiaries,  all of which are wholly owned. In 2002, one of our  subsidiaries  acquired the general  partner of Genesis Energy, L.P. ("Genesis"), a publicly traded master limited partnership.  During 2003, we acquired additional Genesis limited partnership units,  increasing our ownership interest in Genesis from 2% to 9.25%.  We account for our ownership  interest in Genesis under the equity method of accounting.  Even though we have  significant influence over the limited  partnership in our role as general partner,  because our  control  is  limited  by  the  general  partnership  agreement  we  do  not consolidate Genesis. See Note 3 for more information regarding our related party transactions  with  Genesis  and summary  financial  information.  All  material intercompany  balances and transactions have been eliminated.  We have evaluated our  consolidation  of  variable  interest  entities  in  accordance  with  FASB Interpretation No. 46,  "Consolidation of Variable Interest  Entities," and have concluded that we do not have any variable  interest entities that would require consolidation.       Effective  December 29, 2003,  Denbury Resources Inc. changed its corporate structure  to a holding  company  format.  The  purposes of creating the holding company structure were to better reflect the operating  practices and methods of Denbury,  to improve its economics,  and to provide greater  administrative  and operational  flexibility.  As part of this  restructure,  Denbury Resources Inc. (predecessor  entity) merged into a newly formed limited  liability  company and survived as Denbury Onshore,  LLC, a Delaware limited  liability  company and an indirect subsidiary of the newly formed holding company,  Denbury Holdings, Inc. Denbury Holdings, Inc. subsequently assumed the name Denbury Resources Inc. (new entity).  The  reorganization  was  structured as a tax free  reorganization  to Denbury's  stockholders and all outstanding capital stock of the original public company was  automatically  converted  into the identical  number of and type of shares of the new public holding company.  Stockholders'  ownership interests in the business did not change as a result of the new  structure  and shares of the Company  remained  publicly  traded  under the same symbol (DNR) on the New York Stock Exchange.  The new parent holding company is co-obligor (or guarantor,  as appropriate)  regarding  the payment of  principal  and  interest  on  Denbury's outstanding debt securities.  Oil and Natural Gas Operations       A) CAPITALIZED  COSTS. We follow the full-cost method of accounting for oil and  natural  gas   properties.   Under  this  method,   all  costs  related  to acquisitions,  exploration  and  development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized and accumulated in a single cost center representing our activities, which are undertaken  exclusively in the United States. Such costs include lease acquisition  costs,  geological and geophysical  expenditures,  lease rentals on undeveloped  properties,  costs of drilling both  productive and  non-productive wells and general and  administrative  expenses  directly related to exploration and  development  activities and do not include any costs related to production, general  corporate  overhead  or  similar  activities.  Proceeds  received  from disposals are credited against accumulated costs except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.       B) DEPLETION AND DEPRECIATION. The costs capitalized,  including production equipment,  are depleted or depreciated on the unit-of-production  method, based                                         55 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  on proved oil and natural gas reserves as  determined by  independent  petroleum engineers.  Oil and natural gas reserves are converted to equivalent units based upon the relative energy content which is six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil.       C) ASSET  RETIREMENT  OBLIGATIONS.  On  January 1,  2003,  we  adopted  the provisions  of  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 143, "Accounting  for Asset  Retirement  Obligations."  In general,  our future asset retirement  obligations  relate to future  costs  associated  with  plugging and abandonment  of our  oil  and  natural  gas  wells,  removal  of  equipment  and facilities  from  leased  acreage  and  returning  such  land  to  its  original condition. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement  obligation  be  recorded  in the  period  in which  it is  incurred, discounted to its present  value using our credit  adjusted  risk-free  interest rate, and a corresponding  amount  capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related  long-lived asset. The liability is accreted each period, and the capitalized  cost is  depreciated  over the useful  life of the  related  asset. Revisions to estimated  retirement  obligations  will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding  liability.  If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, the difference is recorded to the full cost pool,  unless  significant.  Prior to the  adoption of this new standard,  we recognized a provision for our asset  retirement  obligations each period  as part of our  depletion  and  depreciation  calculation,  based on the unit-of-production  method. See Note 4 for more information regarding our change in accounting related to the adoption of SFAS No. 143.       D)  CEILING  TEST.  The  net  capitalized  costs  of oil  and  natural  gas properties  are  limited  to the lower of  unamortized  cost or the cost  center ceiling.  The cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of (i) the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves before future  abandonment costs  (discounted at 10%), based on unescalated  period-end oil and natural gas prices;  (ii) plus the cost of properties  not being  amortized;  (iii) plus the lower of cost or  estimated  fair value of unproved  properties  included in the costs being  amortized,  if any; (iv) less related income tax effects.  The cost center ceiling test is prepared quarterly.       E) JOINT INTEREST OPERATIONS.  Substantially all of our oil and natural gas exploration and production  activities are conducted jointly with others.  These financial  statements  reflect  only  Denbury's  proportionate  interest in such activities  and any  amounts  due from  other  partners  are  included  in trade receivables.       F) PROVED  RESERVES.  See Note 13 for  information  on our  proved  oil and natural gas reserves and the basis on which they are recorded.  Property and equipment - Other       Other  property and  equipment,  which  includes  furniture  and  fixtures, vehicles,   computer  equipment  and  software,   and  capitalized  leases,  are depreciated  principally on a straight-line  basis over estimated  useful lives. Estimated  useful  lives are  generally as follows:  furniture  and fixtures and vehicles 5 to 10 years; and computer equipment and software 3 to 5 years.       Leased property meeting certain capital lease criteria is capitalized and the present value of the related lease payments is recorded as a liability. Amortization of capitalized leased assets is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the initial lease term.  Revenue Recognition       Revenue is recognized at the time oil and natural gas is produced and sold. Any amounts due from  purchasers  of oil and natural gas are included in accrued production receivables.       We follow the "sales  method" of  accounting  for our oil and  natural  gas revenue,  whereby we recognize  sales  revenue on all oil or natural gas sold to our  purchasers  regardless  of  whether  the  sales  are  proportionate  to our ownership in the property.  A receivable or liability is recognized  only to the                                         56 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  extent  that we have an  imbalance  on a  specific  property  greater  than  the expected  remaining  proved  reserves.  As of December  31,  2004 and 2003,  our aggregate oil and natural gas imbalances  were not material to our  consolidated financial statements.       We recognize revenue and expenses of purchased producing  properties at the time we assume effective control, commencing from either the closing or purchase agreement date, depending on the underlying terms and agreements.  We follow the same  methodology in reverse when we sell properties by recognizing  revenue and expenses of the sold properties  until either the closing or purchase  agreement date, depending on the underlying terms and agreements.  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities       We enter into  derivative  contracts  to mitigate our exposure to commodity price  risk  associated  with  future  oil and  natural  gas  production.  These contracts have historically consisted of options, in the form of price floors or collars, and fixed price swaps. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, derivative financial instruments  are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value.  If the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge,  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings.  If the derivative  qualifies for hedge  accounting,  the change  in fair  value of the  derivative  is  recognized  either  currently  in earnings or deferred in other  comprehensive  income  (equity)  depending on the type of hedge and to what  extent  the hedge is  effective.  All of our  current derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are cash flow hedges.       In order to qualify  for hedge  accounting  the  relationship  between  the hedging  instruments and the hedged items must be highly  effective in achieving the offset of changes in fair  values or cash flows  attributable  to the hedged risk,  both at the  inception of the hedge and on an ongoing  basis.  We measure hedge  effectiveness  on a quarterly  basis.  Hedge  accounting is  discontinued prospectively  when a hedging instrument  becomes  ineffective.  We assess hedge effectiveness  based on total  changes in the fair value of options used in cash flow hedges rather than changes of intrinsic value only. As a result, changes in the entire fair value of option  contracts  are  deferred in  accumulated  other comprehensive  income,  to the  extent  they are  effective,  until  the  hedged transaction is completed. If a hedge becomes ineffective,  any deferred gains or losses on the cash flow hedge remain in accumulated other  comprehensive  income until  the  underlying  production  related  to the  derivative  hedge  has been delivered.  If it is determined  probable that a hedged  forecasted  transaction will not occur, and the hedge is not re-designated,  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings immediately.       Receipts and payments  resulting  from  settlements  of derivative  hedging instruments  qualifying  for hedge  accounting  are  recorded in "Gain (loss) on effective hedge contracts"  included in revenues in the Consolidated  Statements of Operations.  We apply Derivative Implementation Group Issue G20 in accounting for our net purchased  puts and collars,  which allows the  amortization  of the cost of net  purchased  options  over the  period of the hedge.  We record  this amortization  and any gains or losses  resulting from hedge  ineffectiveness  in "Gain (loss) on ineffective  hedge contracts" under expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Denbury's hedging activities are further discussed in Note 9.       Effective  January 1, 2005,  we have  decided  to  de-designate  from hedge accounting  treatment our existing derivative hedging  instruments.  As such, we will account for our  derivative  instruments  in future  periods as speculative contracts  and future  changes in the fair  value of these  instruments  will be recognized  in the income  statement in the period of change.  While this change may result in more volatility in our income in future  periods,  we believe that the benefits associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost, time and effort required to apply hedge accounting.  Financial Instruments with  Off-Balance-Sheet  Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk       Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and accrued production  receivables and the derivative hedging instruments  discussed above. Our  cash  equivalents  and  short-term   investments   represent   high-quality securities placed with various  investment grade  institutions.  This investment practice  limits our exposure to  concentrations  of credit risk.  Our trade and accrued  production  receivables  are  dispersed  among  various  customers  and purchasers; therefore,  concentrations of credit risk are limited. Also, most of our significant purchasers are large companies with excellent credit ratings. If customers  are  considered  a credit  risk,  letters of credit  are the  primary                                         57 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  security  obtained to support lines of credit. We attempt to minimize our credit risk exposure to the  counterparties of our derivative hedging contracts through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures and diversification.  There are no margin requirements with the counterparties of our derivative contracts.  CO2 Operations       We own and  produce CO2  reserves  that are used for our own  tertiary  oil recovery operations,  and in addition, we sell a portion to Genesis and to other third party  industrial  users. We record revenue from our sales of CO2 to third parties when it is produced and sold. CO2 used for our own tertiary oil recovery operations  is not  recorded  as  revenue  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of Operations.  Expenses  related to the  production of CO2 are  allocated  between volumes  sold to third  parties and volumes  used for our own use.  The expenses related to third party sales are recorded in "CO2  operating  expenses"  and the expenses related to our own uses are recorded in "Lease  operating  expenses" in the Consolidated  Statements of Operations.  We capitalize  acquisitions and the costs of exploring  and  developing  CO2  reserves.  The costs  capitalized  are depleted or depreciated on the  unit-of-production  method,  based on proved CO2 reserves as determined by independent engineers.  We evaluate our CO2 assets for impairment by comparing our expected  future revenues from these assets to their net carrying value.  Cash Equivalents       We consider all highly liquid  investments  to be cash  equivalents if they have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.  Short-term Investments       Our  short-term  investments  consist  primarily of  investment  grade debt securities  that are classified as  "available-for-sale"  in accordance with the provisions  of SFAS No. 115,  "Accounting  for Certain  Investments  in Debt and Equity  Securities."  Available-for-sale  securities  are stated at fair  value, based on quoted market  prices,  with the  unrealized  gain or loss, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income.  Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted  into  earnings  over the life of the related  security.  Dividend  and interest  income is  recognized  when earned.  We have no  investments  that are considered to be trading securities.       The  following  is  a  summary  of  current  available-for-sale  marketable securities at December 31, 2004: (In Thousands)                                                       December 31, 2004 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                      Gross        Gross                                                      Amortized    Unrealized    Unrealized    Estimated                                                         Cost         Gains        Losses     Fair Value                                                     ----------------------------------------------------- Certificate of deposits.......................      $    2,000     $     -      $    -      $     2,000 Government and agency obligations.............          17,470           -         (14)          17,456 Other debt securities.........................          37,739           4         (28)          37,715                                                     ------------- ------------ ------------- ------------   Total current available-for-sale securities       $   57,209     $     4      $  (42)      $   57,171                                                     ============= ============ ============= ============ Restricted Cash and Investments       At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had  approximately  $6.4 million and $9.5 million,  respectively,  of  restricted  cash  and  investments  held in  escrow accounts  for future site  reclamation  costs.  These  balances  are recorded at amortized  cost and are included in "Other Assets" in the  Consolidated  Balance Sheets.  The estimated  fair market value of these  investments  at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was the same as amortized cost.                                         58 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   Net Income Per Common Share       Basic net income per common  share is computed  by dividing  the net income attributable to common  stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per common share is  calculated in the same manner,  but also  considers the impact to net income and common shares for the  potential  dilution  from stock  options,  restricted stock and any other outstanding convertible securities.       For each of the three years in the period ended  December  31, 2004,  there were no adjustments to net income for purposes of calculating  basic and diluted net income per common share. The following is a  reconciliation  of the weighted average  shares  used in the basic and  diluted  net  income  per  common  share computations: (In Thousands)                                                      Year Ended December 31, ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                2004          2003         2002                                                             ------------ ------------- ------------ Weighted average common shares - basic.............              54,871        53,881       53,243   Potentially dilutive securities:     Stock options..................................               2,413         1,583        1,122     Restricted stock...............................                  17             -            -                                                             ------------ ------------- ------------ Weighted average common shares - diluted...........              57,301        55,464       54,365                                                             ============ ============= ============ The  weighted  average  common  shares  - basic  amount  in  2004  excludes 1,150,000 shares of non-vested  restricted stock granted in 2004 that is subject to future time vesting requirements.  As these restricted shares vest, they will be included in the shares  outstanding  used to  calculate  basic net income per common  share.  For purposes of  calculating  weighted  average  common shares - diluted,  the non-vested  restricted stock is included in the computation  using the treasury stock method,  with the proceeds equal to the average  unrecognized compensation   during  the  period,   adjusted  for  any  estimated  future  tax consequences recognized directly in equity. The restricted shares were issued in August through  December 2004 and have been included in the  calculation for the periods they were  outstanding.  These shares may result in greater  dilution in future  periods,  depending on the market price of our common stock during those periods.  We excluded  stock options  representing  40,000  shares in 2004,  1.0 million  shares in 2003 and 1.7 million  shares in 2002 from our diluted  shares outstanding  because their  inclusion would be  antidilutive,  as their exercise prices  exceeded  the  average  market  price of our  common  stock  during  the respective periods.  Stock-Based Compensation       We issue  stock  options  to all of our  employees  under our stock  option plans,  which  are  described  more  fully in Note 8. We  account  for our stock options  utilizing  the  recognition  and  measurement  principles of Accounting Principles  Board  Opinion  25  (APB  25),   "Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to Employees,"  and  its  related  interpretations.   Under  these  principles,  no stock-based employee  compensation expense is reflected in net income as long as the stock options have an exercise price equal to the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table  illustrates the effect on net income and net income per common share if we had applied the fair value  provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation," as amended by SFAS No. 148, in accounting for our stock options.                                         59 Denbury Resources Inc.

The effect on deferred  taxes for a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance  for deferred  tax assets is recorded  when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  Use of Estimates       The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amount of certain  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent   assets  and liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  during each  reporting  period.  Management  believes its estimates  and  assumptions  are   reasonable;   however,   such  estimates  and assumptions  are subject to a number of risks and  uncertainties  that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates.  Significant  estimates underlying  these financial  statements  include (i) the fair value of financial derivative instruments,  (ii) the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute  depletion of oil and natural gas  properties,  the related  present value of estimated  future net cash flows therefrom and ceiling test,  (iii) accruals  related to oil and gas  production and revenues,  capital expenditures                                         60 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  and lease  operating  expenses,  (iv) the  estimated  costs and timing of future asset  retirement  obligations,  and (v) estimates  made in the  calculation  of income taxes. While management is not aware of any significant  revisions to any of its  estimates,  there  will  likely be  future  revisions  to its  estimates resulting from matters such as changes in ownership  interests,  payouts,  joint venture audits,  re-allocations by purchasers or pipelines, or other corrections and  adjustments  common  in the oil and gas  industry,  many of  which  require retroactive  application.   These  types  of  adjustments  cannot  be  currently estimated and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs.  Reclassifications       Certain  prior period  amounts have been  reclassified  to conform with the current year presentation.  Such reclassifications had no impact on our reported net income, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, total liabilities or stockholders' equity.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements       On December 16, 2004,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No.  123(R),  which is a revision of SFAS No. 123.  SFAS No.  123(R) supersedes APB 25 and amends SFAS No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows."  Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123.  However,  SFAS  No.  123(R)  will  require  all  share-based  payments  to employees,  including grants of employee stock options,  to be recognized in our Consolidated  Statements of Operations based on their estimated fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.       SFAS No.  123(R)  must be adopted  no later  that July 1, 2005 and  permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods:       o    A  "modified   prospective"  method  in  which  compensation  cost  is           recognized  based  on the  requirements  of SFAS  No.  123(R)  for all           share-based  payments  granted prior to the effective date of SFAS No.           123(R) that remain unvested on the adoption date.       o    A "modified  retrospective"  method which includes the requirements of           the modified  prospective  method  described  above,  but also permits           entities  to  restate  either  all prior  periods  presented  or prior           interim  periods  of  the  year  of  adoption  based  on  the  amounts           previously  recognized  under SFAS No. 123 for  purposes  of pro forma           disclosures.       As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for share-based payments to employees using the intrinsic  value method  prescribed by APB 25 and related interpretations.  As such,  we generally do not recognize  compensation  expense associated  with employee stock options.  Accordingly,  the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)'s fair value method could have a significant  impact on Denbury's  future results of operations,  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position.  Had the Company  adopted SFAS No 123(R) in prior periods,  the impact would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the pro forma net income and earnings per share  disclosures  above.  The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)  will have no effect on the  Company's  unvested  outstanding  restricted stock awards.  We currently  plan to adopt the  provisions  of SFAS No.  123(R). Although we have not  completed  evaluating  the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will have on our future results of operations,  we currently estimate the impact on an annual basis will be similar to our pro forma  disclosures for SFAS No. 123 above.       SFAS No.  123(R) also  requires  the tax  benefits in excess of  recognized compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current  literature.  This requirement may serve to reduce the Denbury's  future cash provided by operating  activities and increase  future  cash  provided  by  financing  activities,  to the  extent  of associated  tax  benefits  that may be realized  in the future.  While we cannot estimate  what those amounts will be in the future  (because they depend,  among other things,  when employees  exercise stock options),  the amount of operating cash flows  recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $4.8 million, $1.3 million and $0.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.       In September  2004, the SEC issued Staff  Accounting  Bulletin No. 106 (SAB 106), which clarifies the calculation of the full cost ceiling and depreciation, depletion,  and  amortization  ("DD&A") of oil and gas properties in conjunction with  accounting  for asset  retirement  obligations  under  SFAS No.  143.  The guidance in SAB 106 had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.                                         61 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES  Sale of Denbury Offshore, Inc.       On July  20,  2004,  we  closed  the  sale of  Denbury  Offshore,  Inc.,  a subsidiary that held our offshore assets, for $200 million (before  adjustments) to Newfield  Exploration Company. The sale price was based on the asset value of the offshore assets as of April 1, 2004, which means that the net operating cash flow (defined as revenue less operating expenses and capital  expenditures) from these  properties  which we received  between April 1st and closing,  as well as expenses of the sale and other  contractual  adjustments,  reduced the  purchase price to approximately $187 million.  We excluded from the sale a discovery well drilled at High Island A-6 during 2004, and certain deep rights at West Delta 27 that we sold for $1.8 million in December 2004, but retained a carried  interest in a deep exploratory well.       Our  financial  results for 2004 include  production,  revenues,  operating expenses,  and capital  expenditures of the offshore properties through July 19, 2004. Revenues of Denbury Offshore, Inc. included in our 2004 results were $62.6 million.  We recorded the proceeds from the sale as a reduction to our full cost pool. We paid  approximately $21 million of current income taxes relating to the sale and paid approximately $2.4 million of employee severance costs in 2004. We used $85 million of the sales proceeds to retire our bank debt.       Our offshore  properties made up  approximately  12.5% of our year-end 2003 proved reserves  (approximately 96 Bcfe as of December 31, 2003) and represented approximately 25% of our 2004 second quarter production (9,114 BOE/d).  COHO Gulf Coast Properties       In August 2002, we acquired the Gulf Coast properties of COHO Energy, Inc., auctioned in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas,  Texas. Our net purchase price was $48.2  million  and  included  nine  fields,  eight of which are  located in Mississippi  and one in Texas.  At  December  31,  2002,  these  properties  had reserves of  approximately  15.1 million  barrels of oil and net  production  of approximately  4,000  barrels of oil per day. The  Mississippi  fields  included interests in the Brookhaven,  Laurel,  Martinville,  Soso and Summerland Fields, with such interests  representing  operational control with working interests in excess of 90%,  plus  interests in the smaller  Bentonia,  Cranfield and Glazier Fields.       In February 2003, we sold Laurel Field,  acquired in the COHO  acquisition, for  $25.9  million  and other  consideration  which  included  an  interest  in Atchafalaya Bay Field (where we already owned an interest) and seismic over that area. At December 31, 2002,  Laurel Field had approximately 7.4 MMBbls of proved reserves.   In  March  2003,  we  sold  the  Bentonia  and  Glazier  fields  for approximately $1.6 million. The proceeds from the sale of Laurel Field were used to reduce our bank debt.                                         62 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  NOTE 3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS - GENESIS       On May 14, 2002,  a newly formed  subsidiary  of Denbury  acquired  Genesis Energy,  L.L.C. (which was susequently  converted to Genesis Energy,  Inc.), the general partner of Genesis,  a publicly traded master limited  partnership,  for total consideration,  including expenses and commissions,  of approximately $2.2 million.  Genesis has two primary  lines of business:  crude oil  gathering  and marketing and pipeline transportation,  primarily in Mississippi, Texas, Alabama and Florida.  In November  2003,  through our  subsidiary  general  partner,  we purchased an  additional  689,000  partnership  common units and 14,000  general partner units of Genesis for $7.15 per unit, with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.0 million.  With these additional units, our ownership interest increased to  approximately  9.25% (2.0%  general  partner  ownership  and 7.25% limited partner ownership).       We are  accounting  for our 9.25%  ownership  in  Genesis  under the equity method  of  accounting  as  we  have  significant  influence  over  the  limited partnership;  however,  our  control is limited  under the  limited  partnership agreement and therefore,  we do not consolidate  Genesis. Our equity in Genesis' net income  (loss) for 2004 was  ($136,000),  for 2003 was $256,000 and for 2002 was $55,000,  representing 2% of Genesis' net income (loss) for the periods from May 14, 2002 through  October 31, 2003 and 9.25% of Genesis'  net income  (loss) for the periods from November 1, 2003 through December 31, 2004. Genesis Energy, Inc., the general  partner of which we own 100%, has guaranteed the bank debt of Genesis,  which  consisted of $15.3 million of debt and $22.8 million in letters of credit at December 31, 2004. There are no guarantees by Denbury or any of its other  subsidiaries  of the debt of  Genesis  or of  Genesis  Energy,  Inc.  Our investment in Genesis of $7.2 million  exceeded our  percentage of net equity in the  limited  partnership  at the  time of  acquisition  by  approximately  $2.2 million, which represents goodwill and is not subject to amortization.  The fair value of our investment in Genesis was $11.1 million at December 31, 2004, based on quoted market values.       Over the past several  years,  including the period prior to our investment in Genesis,  we sold  certain of our oil  production  to Genesis.  Beginning  in September  2004,  we  elected  to sell our own  crude oil to  independent  third parties  rather than to Genesis.  As such, we  discontinued  our direct sales to Genesis and began to transport  our crude oil to our sales point using  Genesis' common carrier pipeline. For these transportation services, we pay Genesis a fee for the use of their pipeline and trucking services.  For 2004, we expensed $1.2 million for these  transportation  services.  At  December  31,  2004,  we had a receivable  from  Genesis of $0.7 million and $6.9 million at December 31, 2003. We  recorded  oil sales to Genesis of $63.5  million,  $48.9  million  and $22.9 million for the years ended  December 31, 2004,  2003,  and 2002,  respectively. Denbury received other miscellaneous  payments from Genesis,  including $120,000 in both 2004 and 2003 in director fees for certain executive officers of Denbury that are board  members of Genesis,  and $508,000 in 2004 and $57,000 in 2003 of pro rata dividend distributions from Genesis.  Transportation Leases       During 2004, we requested that Genesis build two pipelines for our benefit. The  pipelines  were to transport  our crude oil from Olive and McComb Fields in Southwest Mississippi to Genesis' main crude oil pipeline to improve our ability to market our crude oil,  and to  transport  CO2 from our main CO2  pipeline  to Brookhaven Field for our tertiary operations. As part of these arrangements,  we entered into two transportation agreements. The first agreement, entered into in November,  was to transport crude oil from Olive Field. This agreement is for 10 years and has a minimum payment of approximately $18,000 per month. This minimum monthly  charge will increase for any volumes  transported in excess of a stated monthly volume. In December, we entered into the second transportation agreement to transport CO2 to Brookhaven Field in Southwest Mississippi. This agreement is for an eight-year  period and has minimum payments of approximately  $49,000 per month. This minimum monthly payment will increase for any volumes transported in excess of a stated  monthly  volume.  Genesis will  operate and  maintain  these pipelines at its own expense.       We have  accounted for these  agreements as capital  leases.  The pipelines held under these capital leases are classified as property and equipment and are amortized  using  the   straight-line   method  over  the  lease  terms.   Lease amortization is included in depreciation  expense.  The related  obligations are recorded as debt. At December 31, 2004, we had $4.6 million recorded as debt, of which $375,000 was current.                                         63 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  CO2 Volumetric Production Payment       In November  2003,  we sold 167.5 Bcf of CO2 to Genesis  for $24.9  million ($23.9  million as adjusted  for interim  cash flows from the  September 1, 2003 effective date and for transaction costs) under a volumetric  production payment ("VPP"),  and assigned to Genesis three of our existing long-term commercial CO2 supply  agreements with our industrial  customers.  These  industrial  contracts represented  approximately 60% of our then current industrial CO2 sales volumes. Pursuant to the VPP,  Genesis  may take up to 52.5  MMcf/d of CO2 through  2009, 43.0 MMcf/d from 2010 through 2012, and 25.2 MMcf/d to the end of the term.       On August 26, 2004, we closed on another transaction with Genesis,  selling to them a 33.0  Bcf  volumetric  production  payment  ("VPPII")  of CO2 for $4.8 million  ($4.6  million  as  adjusted  for  interim  cash  flows from the July 1 effective date and for transaction  costs) along with a related long-term supply agreement with an industrial  customer.  Pursuant to the VPPII, Genesis may take up to 9 MMcf/d of CO2 to the end of the contract term.       We have recorded the net proceeds of these  volumetric  production  payment sales as deferred  revenue and will  recognize  such revenue as CO2 is delivered during the term of the two volumetric  production payments. At December 31, 2004 and 2003,  $25.8  million  and $23.6  million,  respectively,  was  recorded  as deferred  revenue of which $2.4 million and $2.1 million was included in current liabilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003,  respectively.  During 2004 and 2003, we recognized  deferred revenue of $2.4 million and $0.3 million,  respectively, for  deliveries  under  the VPP and  VPPII.  We  provide  Genesis  with  certain processing and transportation services in connection with these agreements for a fee of  approximately  $0.16  per  Mcf  of CO2  delivered  to  their  industrial customers, which resulted in $2.7 million and $0.4 million in revenue to Denbury for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS       On January 1, 2003, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143,  "Accounting for Asset  Retirement  Obligations."  In general,  our future  asset  retirement obligations  relate to future costs  associated with plugging and abandonment of our oil and natural gas wells,  removal of equipment and facilities  from leased                                         64 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  acreage and  returning  such land to its original  condition.  SFAS 143 requires that the fair  value  of a  liability  for an  asset  retirement  obligation  be recorded in the period in which it is incurred,  discounted to its present value using our credit adjusted  risk-free  interest rate, and a corresponding  amount capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related  long-lived  asset. The liability is accreted each period,  and the capitalized  cost is depreciated over the useful life of the  related  asset.  Prior to the  adoption of this new standard,  we recognized a provision for our asset  retirement  obligations each period  as part of our  depletion  and  depreciation  calculation,  based on the unit-of-production method.       The adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003,  required us to record (i) a $41.0  million  liability  for our future  asset  retirement  obligations  (an increase of $34.1 million in our liability for asset retirement obligations that we had recorded at December 31, 2002),  (ii) a $34.4 million increase in oil and natural  gas   properties,   (iii)  a  $3.9  million   decrease  in  accumulated depreciation and depletion,  and (iv) a $2.6 million gain as a cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting principle, net of taxes.

Under the new agreement,  our borrowing base is currently set at $200 million, with an initial commitment  amount of $100 million.  The borrowing base represents the amount we can borrow from a credit  standpoint  based on our assets,  as  confirmed by the banks, while the commitment amount is the amount we asked the banks to commit to fund pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement. The banks have the option to participate  in any  borrowing  request  made by us in excess of the  commitment amount, up to the borrowing base limit,  although they are not obligated to fund any amount in excess of $100 million, the commitment amount. The advantage to us is that we will pay commitment fees on the commitment  amount, not the borrowing base, thus lowering our overall cost of available credit.       The bank credit facility is secured by  substantially  all of our producing oil and natural gas  properties  and contains  several  restrictions  including, among others: (i) a prohibition on the payment of dividends,  (ii) a requirement for a minimum equity balance,  (iii) a requirement to maintain  positive working capital, as defined, (iv) a minimum interest coverage test and (v) a prohibition of most debt and corporate  guarantees.  We were in  compliance  with all of our bank covenants as of December 31, 2004. Our bank credit facility  provides for a semi-annual  re-determination  of the  borrowing  base on April 1 and October 1. Borrowings  under the credit  facility are  generally in tranches  that can have maturities  up to one year.  Interest on any  borrowings  are based on the Prime Rate or LIBOR rate plus an applicable  margin as  determined  by the  borrowings outstanding. The facility matures in April 2009.       As of  December  31,  2004,  we had no  outstanding  borrowings  under  the facility and  $460,000 in letters of credit  secured by the  facility.  The next scheduled  re-determination  of the borrowing  base will be as of April 1, 2005, based on December 31, 2004 assets and proved reserves.  Subordinated Debt Issuance of 7.5% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013       On March 25, 2003, we issued $225 million of 7.5% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013. The notes were priced at 99.135% of par and we used most of our $218.4 million of net  proceeds  from the  offering,  after  underwriting  and issuance costs, to retire our existing $200 million of 9% Senior  Subordinated  Notes due 2008,  including the Series B notes (see  "Redemption of 9% Senior  Subordinated Notes due 2008 (Including Series B Notes)" below).                                         67 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements       The notes mature on April 1, 2013 and interest on the notes is payable each April 1 and October 1. We may redeem the notes at our option  beginning April 1, 2008 at the following  redemption  prices:  103.75% after April 1, 2008,  102.5% after April 1, 2009,  101.25% after April 1, 2010,  and 100% after April 1, 2011 and thereafter.  In addition, prior to April 1, 2006, we may redeem up to 35% of the notes at a redemption  price of 107.5% with net cash  proceeds  from a stock offering.  The indenture  under which the notes were issued is  essentially  the same  as the  indenture  covering  our  previously  outstanding  9%  notes.  The indenture contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends on our common stock, make investments, create liens on our assets, engage in transactions with our affiliates, transfer or sell assets, consolidate or merge, or sell  substantially all of our assets. The notes are not subject to any sinking fund  requirements.  All of our significant  subsidiaries  fully and unconditionally guarantee this debt.       In    connection     with    our    internal     reorganization     to    a holding-company-organizational  structure  (see Note 1), we entered into a First Supplemental  Indenture  dated  December  29,  2003,  which did not  require the consent  of the  holders of the 7.5%  Senior  Subordinated  Notes due 2013.  The supplemental  indenture made Denbury  Resources Inc. and Denbury  Onshore,  LLC, co-obligors of this debt. All of our significant  subsidiaries continue to fully and unconditionally guarantee this debt. There were no other significant changes as part of the amendment.  Redemption of 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 (Including Series B Notes)       On April 16, 2003,  we redeemed our $200 million of 9% Senior  Subordinated Notes due 2008 at an aggregate cost of $209.0 million,  including a $9.0 million call  premium.  As a result of this early  redemption,  we recorded a before-tax charge to earnings in the second quarter of 2003 of $17.6 million ($11.5 million after  income  tax),  which  included  the $9.0  million  call  premium  and the write-off of the remaining  discount and debt  issuance  costs  associated  with these notes.

Our current income tax benefit in 2002 is primarily  related to tax law changes in 2002 that allowed us to receive a refund of our  alternative  minimum taxes paid for 2001. At December 31, 2004, we have  approximately  $132.3 million in state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2013.  In 2001,  we began to recognize a benefit for the amount of  enhanced  oil  recovery  credits  earned from our  tertiary  recovery projects.  The total credits  earned to date are  approximately  $27.8  million. These credits begin to expire in 2020.       Deferred income taxes relate to temporary differences based on tax laws and statutory rates in effect at the December 31, 2004 and 2003 balance sheet dates. We believe  that we will be able to utilize  all of our  deferred  tax assets at December 31, 2004,  and therefore have provided no valuation  allowance  against our deferred tax assets.

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  Authorized       We are  authorized to issue 100 million  shares of common stock,  par value $.001 per share,  and 25 million shares of preferred  stock, par value $.001 per share.  The preferred shares may be issued in one or more series with rights and conditions determined by the board of directors.  Stock Repurchase Plan  Since August 2003,  Denbury has had an active stock  repurchase plan ("Plan") to purchase  shares of our common  stock on the NYSE in order for such  repurchased shares to be reissued to our employees  who  participate  in Denbury's  Employee Stock Purchase Plan (see Employee Stock Purchase Plan below).  The Plan provides for purchases through an independent broker of 50,000 shares of Denbury's common stock per fiscal  quarter over a period of  approximately  twelve  months,  or a total of 200,000  shares per year.  Purchases are to be made at prices and times determined at the discretion of the independent broker, provided however that no purchases  may be made during the last ten  business  days of a fiscal  quarter. During 2003, we purchased  100,000 shares at an average cost of $12.77 per share and reissued  91,838 of those shares under  Denbury's  Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan. In 2004, we repurchased into treasury 200,000 shares at an average cost of $19.89 per share and reissued  115,090  treasury shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Our current repurchase program extends through June 2005.  Stock Option Plans       Denbury has two stock  option  plans in effect at December  31,  2004.  The first plan has been in existence since 1995 (the "1995 Plan") and will expire in August 2005.  The second plan,  the 2004 Omnibus Stock and  Incentive  Plan (the "2004 Plan"),  has a ten year term and was approved by the  shareholders  in May 2004. At December 31, 2004,  we had a total of 8,195,587  shares of common stock authorized for issuance  pursuant to the 1995 Plan, of which 710,291 shares were available for issuance, and 1,125,000 shares authorized for issuance pursuant to the 2004 Plan, of which all 1,125,000  were  available for issuance.  In January 2005, we issued options under the 1995 Plan that utilized  substantially  all of the  remaining  shares  under the 1995 Plan and that same  month  began  issuing options under the 2004 Plan. We do not  anticipate  issuing any further  options pursuant  to the 1995 Plan and all future  grants  will be made  pursuant to the 2004 Plan. Under the terms of these plans,  incentive and non-qualified  options may be  issued  to  officers,  employees,  directors  and  consultants.  Options generally become  exercisable over a four-year  vesting period with the specific terms of vesting  determined by the board of directors at the time of grant. The options  expire  over terms not to exceed  ten years from the date of grant,  90 days after  termination of employment or permanent  disability or one year after the death of the  optionee.  The options are granted at the fair market value at the time of grant,  which is  generally  defined in the 1995 Plan as the average closing price of our common stock for the ten trading days prior to issuance, or in the case of the 2004  Plan,  the  closing  price on the date of grant.  These plans are  administered  by the  Compensation  Committee of  Denbury's  Board of Directors.                                         70 Denbury Resources Inc.

The holders of these shares have all of the rights and privileges of owning the shares (including voting rights) except that the holders are not  entitled to  delivery  of the  certificates  until  certain requirements  are met. With respect to the 1,100,000  shares of restricted stock granted to officers of Denbury,  the vesting restrictions on those shares are as follows:  i) 65% of the awards vest 20% per year over five years and, ii) 35% of the awards vest upon  retirement,  as defined in the 2004 Plan.  With respect to the 65% of the awards that vest over five years,  on each annual  vesting  date, 66-2/3% of the vested  shares may be delivered to the holder with the  remaining 33-1/3%  retained  and held in escrow  until the  holder's  separation  from the Company.  With  respect  to the 50,000  restricted  shares  issued to  Denbury's independent  board  members,  the shares vest 20% per year over five years.  For these  shares,  on each annual  vesting  date,  40% of such vested shares may be delivered to the holder with the remaining 60% retained and held in escrow until                                         71 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  the holder's separation from the Company. All restricted shares vest upon death, disability or a change in control.       Upon issuance of the 1,150,000  shares of restricted  stock pursuant to the 2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan, we recorded deferred compensation expense of $23.3  million,  the  market  value of the  shares on the grant  dates,  as a reduction to  shareholders'  equity.  This  expense  will be amortized  over the applicable  five year or  retirement  date  vesting  periods.  The  compensation expense  recorded  with  respect to the  restricted  shares for the year  ending December 31, 2004, was $1.6 million.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan       We have a Stock  Purchase  Plan that is authorized to issue up to 1,750,000 shares of common  stock to all  full-time  employees.  As of December  31, 2004, there are 291,376  authorized  shares  remaining to be issued under the plan. In accordance  with the plan,  employees  may  contribute  up to 10% of their  base salary and Denbury  matches 75% of their  contribution.  The combined  funds are used to purchase  previously  unissued  Denbury  common stock or treasury  stock purchased  by the Company in the open market for that  purpose,  in either case, based on the market value of Denbury's  common stock at the end of each quarter. We  recognize  compensation  expense for the 75% company  match  portion,  which totaled $1,011,000, $997,000 and $822,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,  respectively.  This  plan is  administered  by the  Compensation Committee of Denbury's  Board of Directors.  This plan  currently  terminates in August 2005,  although we plan to request that shareholders extend this plan for another five years at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  401(k) Plan       Denbury offers a 401(k) Plan to which employees may contribute tax deferred earnings  subject  to  Internal  Revenue  Service  limitations.  Up  to 3% of an employee's  compensation,  as defined by the plan, is matched by Denbury at 100% and an employee's  contribution  between 3% and 6% of compensation is matched by Denbury at 50%.  Denbury's  match is vested  immediately.  During 2004, 2003 and 2002,  Denbury's matching  contributions  were approximately $1.0 million,  $1.1 million, and $884,000, respectively, to the 401(k) Plan.  NOTE 9. DERIVATIVE HEDGING CONTRACTS       We enter  into  various  financial  contracts  to  hedge  our  exposure  to commodity  price risk  associated  with  anticipated  future oil and natural gas production. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  These contracts have historically  consisted of price floors, collars and fixed  price  swaps.  Historically,  we have  generally  attempted  to hedge between 50% and 75% of our anticipated production each year to provide us with a reasonably  certain  amount of cash  flow to cover a  majority  of our  budgeted exploration and development  expenditures  without  incurring  significant debt, although our hedging  percentage  may vary relative to our debt levels.  When we make  a  significant  acquisition,   we  generally  attempt  to  hedge  a  large percentage,  up to 100%, of the forecasted  production for the subsequent one to three years following the acquisition in order to help provide us with a minimum return on our  investment.  Our recent hedging  activity has been  predominantly with  collars,  although  for the 2002 COHO  acquisition,  we also used swaps in order  to  lock  in the  prices  used  in  our  economic  forecasts.  All of the mark-to-market  valuations  used for our financial  derivatives  are provided by external sources and are based on prices that are actively quoted. We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures,  which are  reviewed  on an ongoing  basis.  We attempt to  minimize credit  risk  exposure  to   counterparties   through  formal  credit  policies, monitoring procedures, and diversification.                                         72 Denbury Resources Inc.

These hedges, in the form of price floors,  covered nearly all of the forecasted  production from the acquired  properties  through the end of 2003 at floor  prices  ranging from $3.75 to $4.25 per MMBtu.  Due to the  falling  natural gas prices in the latter half of 2001, we collected  approximately  $12.7  million on these  hedges.  The price floors  relating to 2002 and 2003 were purchased  from Enron  Corporation, which filed  bankruptcy in December 2001. We sold our  bankruptcy  claim against Enron in February 2002 for net proceeds of approximately $9.2 million. In total, we collected  approximately  $21.9 million from the price floors relating to the Matrix  acquisition,  resulting in a net cash gain of approximately $3.9 million over the cost of the  floors.  Because of the rise in natural  gas prices  after December 2001, we would not have collected anything on the price floors relating to 2003, even if Enron had not filed bankruptcy, as the natural gas NYMEX prices during 2003 were above $3.75 (the floor price for 2003).  We calculate  that our total  cash loss due to  Enron's  bankruptcy  was  approximately  $5.4  million, representing the difference between what we would have collected during 2002 and the $9.2 million that we obtained from selling the bankruptcy claim.                                         73 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements       When Enron filed for bankruptcy  during the fourth  quarter of 2001,  these Enron hedges ceased to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, which changed the accounting  treatment  for those  hedges as of that point in time as required by SFAS No. 133. The result was that any future changes in the current market value of these assets had to be reflected in the income  statement  and any  remaining accumulated other comprehensive  income at the time of the accounting change had to be recognized  over the original  expected life of the hedges.  To adjust the value of the Enron hedges down to the market  value at December 31, 2001,  which was  determined to be the amount that we received from the sale of our claims in February  2002, we recorded a pre-tax  write-down of $24.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. We also had a claim against  Enron for  production  receivables relating to November 2001 natural gas production  that was also sold in February 2002,  which  resulted in an overall  total  pre-tax  loss on our Enron  related assets  of  $25.2  million.   The  after-tax   balance  in   accumulated   other comprehensive  income  related to these  Enron  hedges was  approximately  $11.6 million at the point they no longer qualified for hedge accounting. Accordingly, we recognized  pre-tax  income  attributable  to the Enron hedges during 2002 of approximately  $13.4  million  and  recognized  pre-tax  income  during  2003 of approximately  $5.1 million.  The three-year total pre-tax net loss on the Enron hedges was approximately $5.9 million, which approximates the difference between the amount  collected  and paid for the Enron  portion of the  associated  price floors.

To the extent our hedges are considered  effective,  this  fair  value  liability,  net of income  taxes,  is included  in  Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  reported  under Stockholders'  equity  in  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  The  balance  in accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss of $4.8  million at December  31,  2004, represents the deficit in the fair market value of our  derivative  contracts as compared to the cost of our hedges,  net of income  taxes.  The $4.8  million in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2004, will expire within the next 12 months.       We have  decided  to  de-designate  from  hedge  accounting  treatment  our existing derivative hedging instruments,  effective January 1, 2005. As such, we will account for our  derivative  instruments  in future  periods as speculative contracts  and future  changes in the fair  value of these  instruments  will be recognized  in the income  statement  in the  period of  change.  While this may result in more volatility in our income statement in future periods,  we believe that the benefits  associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost, time and effort required to apply hedge accounting.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES       We have  operating  leases for the rental of office space,  equipment,  and vehicles  that totaled  $21.6  million,  $16.6  million,  and $1.7 million as of December 31, 2004, 2003,and 2002, respectively.  In addition, in 2004 we entered into two lease financing arrangements totaling $6.9 million for equipment at our McComb Field and Jackson  Dome CO2 Field.  These lease terms are for seven years with monthly  payments of  approximately  $91,000 per month.  In August 2003, we entered into a $6.0 million lease financing arrangement for certain equipment at our CO2  processing  facility at Mallalieu  Field.  This lease term is for seven years with monthly payments of approximately $81,000 per month.                                         74 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements       In 2004, we entered into two agreements with Genesis to transport crude oil and CO2. These  agreements are accounted for as capital leases and are discussed in detail in Note 3.       At December 31, 2004,  long-term  commitments  for these items  require the following future minimum rental payments: Capital     Operating (In Thousands)                                       Leases       Leases --------------------------------------------------------------- ------------ 2005........................................        $      806  $     3,977 2006........................................               806        3,967 2007........................................               806        3,954 2008........................................               806        3,807 2009........................................               806        3,064 Thereafter..................................             2,777        2,813                                                    ------------ ------------   Total minimum lease payments..............             6,807  $    21,582                                                                 ============ Less:  Amount representing interest.........            (2,248)                                                    ------------   Present value of minimum lease payments...       $     4,559                                                    ============ Long-term  contracts  require  us to  deliver  CO2  to our  industrial  CO2 customers at various contracted prices,  plus we have a CO2 delivery  obligation to Genesis  related to two CO2  volumetric  production  payments  (see  "Genesis Transactions"  above).  Based upon the maximum amounts  deliverable as stated in the contracts and the volumetric  production payment, we estimate that we may be obligated  to deliver up to 398 Bcf of CO2 to these  customers  over the next 17 years; however,  since the group as a whole has historically  purchased less CO2 than the  maximum  allowed in their  contracts,  based on the  current  level of deliveries,   we  project  that  our  commitment  would  likely  be  reduced  to approximately  332  Bcf.  The  maximum  volume  required  in any  given  year is approximately  101 MMcf/d,  although  based on our current level of  deliveries, this would likely be reduced to approximately  78 MMcf/d.  Given the size of our proven CO2 reserves at December 31, 2004 (approximately 2.7 Tcf before deducting approximately  178.7 Bcf for the VPPs), our current production  capabilities and our  projected  levels of CO2 usage for our own tertiary  flooding  program,  we believe that we can meet these delivery obligations.       Denbury is subject to various possible  contingencies  that arise primarily from interpretation of federal and state laws and regulations  affecting the oil and natural gas industry.  Such contingencies include differing  interpretations as to the prices at which oil and natural  gas sales may be made,  the prices at which royalty owners may be paid for production from their leases, environmental issues and other matters. Although management believes that it has complied with the various laws and  regulations,  administrative  rulings and  interpretations thereof,  adjustments could be required as new  interpretations  and regulations are issued. In addition,  production rates,  marketing and environmental matters are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies.  Litigation       We are  involved in various  lawsuits,  claims and  regulatory  proceedings incidental to our businesses,  including  those noted below.  While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings,  individually and in the aggregate,  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations or cash flows,  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility  of a  material  adverse  impact on our net  income in the period in which the ruling  occurs.  We provide  accruals for  litigation and claims if we determine that we may have a range of legal exposure that would require accrual. The estimate of the potential impact from the following legal proceedings on our financial position or overall results of operations could change in the future.       Along with two other  companies,  we have been named in a lawsuit styled J. Paulin Duhe, Inc. vs. Texaco, Inc., et al, Cause No. 101,227, filed in late 2003 in the 16th Judicial District Court, Division "E", Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, seeking  restoration to its original condition of property on which oil has been produced over the past 70 years.  The contract and tort claims by the plaintiffs                                         75 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  allege  surface and  groundwater  damage of 26 acres that are part of our Iberia Field in Iberia Parish, Louisiana.  Recently, plaintiff's experts have initially alleged that clean-up of alleged  contamination of the property would cost $79.0 million,  although  settlement  offers by plaintiffs  have already been made for much  smaller  sums.  The  property was  originally  leased to Texaco,  Inc. for mineral development in 1934 and Denbury acquired its interest in the property in August 2000 from Manti Operating Company.  Discovery is currently underway,  and the April 2005 trial setting has been  continued to an  unspecified  date in the future.  We believe that we are indemnified by the prior owner,  which we expect to cover our exposure to most damages,  if any,  found to have occurred prior to the time that we purchased the property. We believe that the allegations of this lawsuit are subject to a number of  defenses,  are without  merit and we and the other defendants plan to vigorously  defend this lawsuit,  and if necessary,  we will seek indemnification from the prior owner.       On December 29, 2003,  an action styled Harry Bourg  Corporation  vs. Exxon Mobil  Corporation,  et al,  Cause No.  140749,  was filed in the 32nd  Judicial District Court,  Terrebonne  Parish,  Louisiana against Denbury and eleven other oil companies and their  predecessors  alleging  damage as the result of mineral exploration activities conducted by these oil and gas  operators/companies  over the last 60 years.  Plaintiff  has  asked for  restoration  of the  10,000  acre property  and/or  damages in claims  made under tort law and various oil and gas contracts.  The Bourg Corporation recently produced its first preliminary expert reports that allege damages of  approximately  $100.0 million  against  Denbury. Discovery is continuing in this case, with trial currently set for January 2006. We  believe  the  allegations  of this  lawsuit  are  without  merit and plan to vigorously defend this lawsuit along with the other defendants. No provision has been accrued in our financial statements.  NOTE 11.  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  Significant Oil and Natural Gas Purchasers       Oil  and  natural  gas  sales  are  made on a  day-to-day  basis  or  under short-term contracts at the current area market price. The loss of any purchaser would not be expected to have a material adverse effect upon our operations. For the year ended December 31, 2004, two purchasers  each accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues:  Hunt Refining (21%) and Genesis (14%). For the year ended December 31, 2003, we had two  significant  purchasers  that each accounted  for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas  revenues:  Hunt  Refining (15%) and Genesis  (12%).  For the year ended  December 31, 2002, two purchasers each accounted for 10% or more of our natural gas revenues:  Hunt Refining (14%) and Genesis (11%).

The fair values of our senior  subordinated  notes are based on quoted market prices.  The fair values of our short-term  investments  are discussed in Note 1. We have other financial  instruments  consisting primarily of cash, cash equivalents, short-term receivables and payables that approximate fair value due to the nature of the instrument and the relatively short maturities.  NOTE 12. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION       On  December  29,  2003,  we  amended  the  indenture  for our 7.5%  Senior Subordinated  Notes due 2013 to reflect our new holding  company  organizational structure (see Note 1 and Note 6). As part of this  restructuring  our indenture was amended so that both Denbury Resources Inc. and Denbury Onshore,  LLC became co-obligors  of our  subordinated  debt.  Prior  to  this  restructure,  Denbury Resources  Inc.  was the  sole  obligor.  Our  subordinated  debt is  fully  and unconditionally guaranteed by Denbury Resources Inc.'s significant subsidiaries. Genesis  Energy,  Inc.,  the subsidiary  that holds the Company's  investment in Genesis Energy,  L.P., is not a guarantor of our subordinated  debt. The results of our equity interest in Genesis is reflected  through the equity method by one of our significant subsidiaries, Denbury Gathering & Marketing.

SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND NATURAL GAS DISCLOSURES (UNAUDITED)  Costs Incurred       The following  table  summarizes  costs incurred and capitalized in oil and natural  gas  property  acquisition,  exploration  and  development  activities. Property  acquisition  costs are those costs  incurred to  purchase,  lease,  or otherwise  acquire  property,  including  both  undeveloped  leasehold  and  the purchase of reserves in place.  Exploration  costs include costs of  identifying areas  that may  warrant  examination  and  examining  specific  areas  that are considered to have prospects containing oil and natural gas reserves,  including costs of  drilling  exploratory  wells,  geological  and  geophysical  costs and carrying  costs on  undeveloped  properties.  Development  costs are incurred to obtain access to proved  reserves,  including  the cost of drilling  development wells, and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and natural gas.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Oil and Natural Gas Reserves       Net proved oil and natural gas reserve  estimates  for all years  presented were  prepared by DeGolyer  and  MacNaughton,  independent  petroleum  engineers located  in Dallas,  Texas.  The  reserves  were  prepared  in  accordance  with guidelines   established  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange   Commission   and, accordingly,  were based on existing economic and operating conditions.  Oil and natural gas prices in effect as of the reserve report date were used without any escalation.  (See "Standardized  Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes  Therein  Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas  Reserves"  below for a discussion  of the  effect of the  different  prices on reserve  quantities  and values.) Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs were based on current costs with no escalation.       We have a  corporate  policy  whereby  we do not  book  proved  undeveloped reserves until we have committed to perform the required development operations, the majority of which we generally  expect to commence  within the next year. We also  have a  corporate  policy  whereby  proved  undeveloped  reserves  must be economic  at prices  significantly  lower than the  year-end  prices used in our reserve report, at prices closer to historical averages.       There are  numerous  uncertainties  inherent in  estimating  quantities  of proved  reserves and in projecting  the future rates of production and timing of development  expenditures.  The following reserve data represents estimates only and should not be construed as being exact.  Moreover, the present values should not be construed as the current market value of our oil and natural gas reserves or the costs that would be incurred to obtain  equivalent  reserves.  All of our reserves are located in the United States.

Standardized  Measure of  Discounted  Future Net Cash Flows and Changes  Therein Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves       The  Standardized  Measure of Discounted  Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves ("Standardized Measure") does not  purport to present  the fair  market  value of our oil and natural gas properties.  An estimate of such value  should  consider,  among other  factors, anticipated  future prices of oil and natural gas, the probability of recoveries in excess of  existing  proved  reserves,  the value of  probable  reserves  and acreage prospects, and perhaps different discount rates. It should be noted that                                         82 Denbury Resources Inc.                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  estimates of reserve quantities, especially from new discoveries, are inherently imprecise and subject to substantial revision.       Under the  Standardized  Measure,  future cash  inflows  were  estimated by applying  year-end prices to the estimated future  production of year-end proved reserves.  The product  prices used in  calculating  these  reserves have varied widely during the three-year  period.  These prices have a significant impact on both the  quantities  and value of the proven  reserves as the reduced oil price causes  wells to reach the end of their  economic  life much sooner and can make certain  proved  undeveloped  locations  uneconomical,  both of which reduce the reserves. The following  representative oil and natural gas year-end prices were used in the Standardized Measure.  These prices were adjusted by field to arrive at the appropriate corporate net price.

Future  income taxes were computed by applying the statutory tax rate to the excess of pre-tax cash inflows over our tax basis in the  associated proved oil and  natural gas  properties.  Tax  credits  and net  operating  loss carryforwards were also considered in the future income tax calculation.  Future net cash inflows after income taxes were discounted  using a 10% annual discount rate to arrive at the Standardized Measure.

CO2 Reserves       Based on engineering reports prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton,  our CO2 reserves,  on a 100% working interest basis, were estimated at approximately 2.7 Tcf at  December  31, 2004  (includes  178.7 Bcf of  reserves  dedicated  to two volumetric  production  payments  with  Genesis),  1.6 Tcf at December  31, 2003 (includes 162.6 Bcf of reserves dedicated to a volumetric  production  payment), and 1.6 Tcf at December  31,  2002.  We make  reference  to the gross  amount of proved  reserves  as that is the amount  that is  available  both for  Denbury's tertiary recovery programs and for industrial users who are customers of Denbury and others,  as we are  responsible for  distributing  the entire CO2 production stream for both of these purposes.                                          84 Denbury Resources Inc.

(3)  Auction rate securities in the amount of $35.4 million at September 30, 2004, have been reclassified from cash      and equivalent to short-term investments to conform to the December 31, 2004 presentation.

CHANGES  IN AND  DISAGREEMENTS  WITH  ACCOUNTANTS ON  ACCOUNTING  AND ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE --------------------       On May 12, 2004, the Audit Committee of Denbury approved the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004,  replacing  Deloitte & Touche LLP, which had been the Company's  independent  auditors  since 1990.  This decision was affirmed by Denbury's Board of Directors.  Information  regarding this change in independent auditors  was  included  in our  report  on Form 8-K  dated  May 17,  2004,  and subsequently  amended  on May 24,  2004.  There  have been no other  changes  in accountants nor any disagreements with accountants.  ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES --------------------------------       We maintain  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  internal  controls designed to ensure that  information  required  to be  disclosed  in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported  within the time  periods  specified  in the  Securities  and  Exchange Commission's  rules and forms.  Our chief executive  officer and chief financial officer have evaluated our  disclosure  controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K and have  determined  that such disclosure  controls and procedures are effective in all material  respects in  providing  to them on a timely  basis  material  information  required to be disclosed in this annual  report.  Our  assessment of our internal  control over financial   reporting   as  of   December   31,   2004  has  been   audited   by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8 herein.       There have been no changes in internal  controls over  financial  reporting during  the  period  covered  by this  annual  report  on Form  10-K  that  have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.       In  January  2005,  we  began   processing  our  transactions  on  a  newly implemented  accounting  software  system.  We  changed  systems in order (i) to integrate and automate more of our  functions,  which will also allow us to have more  information  in  one  integrated  database,   (ii)  to  provide  operating efficiencies,  (iii) to enable us to close  our  books in a more  timely  manner without  sacrificing  quality,  (iv) to review and improve our processes and (v) improve the internal control surrounding our computer systems.  All of Denbury's 2004  accounting was performed on its prior system and as a result,  this change had no impact on Denbury's  internal  control over  financial  reporting  during 2004. As a result of moving to a new system in January 2005, we anticipate  that certain  control  procedures  will need to be  changed  during  2005 in order to conform to our new system.  We plan to evaluate  those changes  during the first quarter of 2005. While we believe that our new accounting system will ultimately strengthen  our  internal  control  system,  there are  inherent  weaknesses  in implementing  any new system and until we have fully  tested all  changes to our controls,  we may not be able to provide assurance that our disclosure  controls are effective in all material respects.
