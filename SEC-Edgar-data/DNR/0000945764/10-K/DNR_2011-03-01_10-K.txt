PART I  Item 1. Business ----------------  Website Access to Reports       We make our  annual  report on Form 10-K,  quarterly  reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant  to  section  13(a)  or 15(d) of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934 available free of charge on or through our internet website, www.denbury.com, as soon as reasonably  practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.  The Company       Denbury Resources Inc. is a Delaware corporation,  organized under Delaware General  Corporation  Law  ("DGCL")  engaged  in the  acquisition,  development, operation and  exploration  of oil and natural gas  properties in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and in the Gulf of Mexico. Our corporate headquarters is located at 5100 Tennyson Parkway, Suite 3000, Plano, Texas 75024, and our phone number is 972-673-2000.  At December 31, 2003, we had 374 employees, 249 of which were employed in field operations or at the field offices.  Our employee count does not include 200 employees of Genesis Energy, Inc. as of December 31, 2003 as its employees  exclusively carry out the business activities of Genesis Energy,  L.P., which we do not consolidate in our financial statements (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  Incorporation and Organization       Denbury was originally incorporated in Canada in 1951. In 1992, we acquired all of the shares of a United States operating company, Denbury Management, Inc. ("DMI"),  and subsequent to the merger we sold all of its Canadian assets. Since that time, all of our operations have been in the United States.       In April 1999, our stockholders  approved a move of our corporate  domicile from Canada to the United States as a Delaware corporation. Along with the move, our wholly  owned  subsidiary,  DMI,  was merged  into the new  Delaware  parent company, Denbury Resources Inc. This move of domicile did not have any effect on our operations or assets.       Effective  December 29, 2003,  Denbury Resources Inc. changed its corporate structure  to a holding  company  format.  The  purposes of creating the holding company structure were to better reflect the operating  practices and methods of Denbury,  to improve its economics,  and to provide greater  administrative  and operational  flexibility.  As part of this  restructure,  Denbury Resources Inc. (predecessor  entity) merged into a newly formed limited liability company,  and survived as, Denbury Onshore,  LLC, a Delaware limited  liability company and an indirect subsidiary of the newly formed holding company,  Denbury Holdings, Inc. Denbury Holdings, Inc. subsequently assumed the name Denbury Resources Inc. (new entity).  The  reorganization  was  structured as a tax free  reorganization  to Denbury's  stockholders and all outstanding capital stock of the original public company was  automatically  converted  into the identical  number of and type of shares of the new public holding company.  Stockholders'  ownership interests in the business did not change as a result of the new  structure  and shares of the Company remain publicly traded under the same symbol (DNR) on the New York Stock Exchange.  The new  parent  holding  company is  co-obligor  (or  guarantor,  as appropriate)  regarding  the payment of  principal  and  interest  on  Denbury's outstanding debt securities.  Business Strategy       As part of our corporate strategy,  we believe in the following fundamental principles:       o    remain focused in specific regions;       o    acquire  properties  where we believe  additional value can be created           through a combination of  exploitation,  development,  exploration and           marketing;                                         3 Denbury Resources Inc.        o    acquire  properties  that  give us a  majority  working  interest  and           operational control or where we believe we can ultimately obtain it;       o    maximize the value of our  properties  by  increasing  production  and           reserves while reducing cost; and       o    maintain a highly  competitive  team of experienced  and  incentivized           personnel.  Acquisitions       Information as to recent acquisitions by Denbury is set forth under Note 2, "Acquisitions," to the Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Such information is incorporated herein by reference.  Oil and Gas Operations       Information  regarding  selected  operating  data and a  discussion  of our significant  operating areas and the primary properties within those three areas are set forth under "Selected  Operating  Data," appearing on pages 9 through 13 of the Annual Report to Shareholders  and the Operations  Sections  appearing on pages 17 through 30 of the  Annual  Report.  Such  information  is  incorporated herein by reference.  Oil and Gas Acreage, Productive Wells, Drilling Activity       Information  regarding oil and gas acreage,  productive  wells and drilling activity are set forth under "Selected  Operating Data," appearing on page 13 of the Annual Report.  Title to Properties       Customarily  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry,  only  a  perfunctory  title examination  is  conducted  at the time  properties  believed to be suitable for drilling  operations  are first  acquired.  Prior to  commencement  of  drilling operations,  a thorough drill site title examination is normally conducted,  and curative  work  is  performed  with  respect  to  significant  defects.   During acquisitions,  title reviews are performed on all  properties;  however,  formal title opinions are obtained on only the higher value properties. We believe that we have good  title to our oil and  natural  gas  properties,  some of which are subject to minor encumbrances, easements and restrictions.  Production       Information  regarding average  production rates, unit sale prices and unit costs per BOE are set forth  under  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"  appearing on pages 43 through 46 of the Annual Report.  Geographic Segments       All of our operations are in the United States.  Significant Oil and Gas Purchasers and Product Marketing       Oil and gas sales are made on a day-to-day basis under short-term contracts at the current area market price.  The loss of any single purchaser would not be expected to have a material  adverse effect upon our  operations;  however,  the loss of a large single  purchaser could  potentially  reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production,  which in turn could  negatively  impact the prices we receive.  For the year ended December 31, 2003, we had two significant purchasers  that each  accounted  for more than 10% of our total oil and natural gas revenues:  Hunt Refining (15%) and Genesis Energy,  L.P. (12%). For the year ended December 31, 2002,  two  purchasers  each accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas  revenues:  Hunt Refining  (14%) and  Genesis  Energy,  L.P. (11%).  For the year ended December 31, 2001, four purchasers each accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas  revenues:  Conoco  (14%),  Hunt Refining (13%),  EOTT  Energy  (12%),  and Dynegy  (12%).                                         4 Denbury Resources Inc.        Our ability to market oil and natural  gas depends on many  factors  beyond our control,  including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the proximity of our gas production to pipelines, the available capacity in such pipelines,  the demand for oil and natural gas, the effects of weather, and the effects of state and federal  regulation.  Our  production is primarily from developed  fields  close  to  major  pipelines  or  refineries  and  established infrastructure.  As a result,  we have not experienced any difficulty to date in finding  a  market  for all of our  production  as it  becomes  available  or in transporting  our  production to those markets;  however,  there is no assurance that we will always be able to market all of our production or obtain  favorable prices.  Oil Marketing       The  quality of our crude oil  varies by area as well as the  corresponding price received.  In Heidelberg  Field,  our single largest field,  and our other Eastern Mississippi properties,  our oil production is primarily light to medium sour crude and sells at a significant  discount to the NYMEX prices.  In Western Mississippi,  our  CO2  operations,  and in  Louisiana,  our oil  production  is primarily  light sweet crude,  which typically sells at a small discount or even at a premium to NYMEX.  For the year ended  December 31, 2003,  the discount for our oil  production  from  Heidelberg  Field  averaged $5.92 per Bbl and for our Eastern  Mississippi  properties as a whole the discount  averaged $5.50 per Bbl relative to NYMEX oil prices.  For Little  Creek  Field,  the largest of our CO2 properties in Western  Mississippi,  we averaged a premium of $0.70 per Bbl over NYMEX oil  prices,  and for our Western  Mississippi  properties  and  Louisiana properties as a whole, we averaged a discount of $0.29 per Bbl relative to NYMEX oil prices.  Natural Gas Marketing       Virtually all of our natural gas production is close to existing  pipelines and  consequently,  we generally have a variety of options to market our natural gas. We sell the majority of our natural gas on one year  contracts  with prices fluctuating  month-to-month  based on  published  pipeline  indices  with slight premiums or discounts to the index.  Product Price Derivative Hedging Contracts       To reduce our  exposure  to  fluctuations  in the prices of oil and natural gas, we currently  and may in the future enter into hedging  arrangements  for a portion of our oil and natural gas production. Hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:       o    production is less than expected;       o    the  counter-party  to the hedging  contract  defaults on its contract           obligations (as was the case with respect to our hedges placed in 2001           with an  Enron  subsidiary  as  counterparty,  which  resulted  in our           suffering a loss); or       o    there is a change in the expected  differential between the underlying           price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received.       In  addition,  these  hedging  arrangements  may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas.  Information as to these  activities is set forth under  "Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  - Market  Risk  Management," appearing on pages 51 through 52 of the Annual Report and in Note 9, "Derivative Hedging Contracts," to the Consolidated  Financial Statements.  Such information is incorporated herein by reference.                                          5 Denbury Resources Inc.   Operating Environment Risk Factors  Oil and Natural Gas Price Volatility       Our future  financial  condition,  results of  operations  and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depends primarily upon the prices we receive  for our oil and  natural  gas  production.  Oil and  natural gas prices historically  have been  volatile and likely will continue to be volatile in the future,  especially given current world geopolitical  conditions.  Our cash flow from  operations  is highly  dependent on the prices that we receive for oil and natural  gas.  This price  volatility  also  affects the amount of our cash flow available  for capital  expenditures  and our  ability to borrow  money or raise additional capital.  The amount we can borrow or have outstanding under our bank credit facility is subject to semi-annual  redeterminations.  In the short-term, our  production  is  relatively  balanced  between  oil  and  natural  gas,  but long-term,  oil  prices  are  likely to affect us more than  natural  gas prices because  approximately  71% of our  reserves  are oil.  The  prices  for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of  additional  factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:       o    the level of consumer demand for oil and natural gas;       o    the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;       o    the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting           Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;       o    the price of foreign oil and natural gas;       o    domestic governmental regulations and taxes;       o    the price and availability of alternative fuel sources;       o    weather conditions;       o    market uncertainty;       o    political  conditions  in  oil  and  natural  gas  producing  regions,           including the Middle East; and       o    worldwide economic conditions.       These factors and the  volatility of the energy  markets  generally make it extremely  difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price  movements with any  certainty.  Also,  oil and  natural gas prices do not  necessarily  move in tandem.  Declines in oil and natural gas prices  would not only reduce  revenue, but  could  reduce  the  amount  of oil and  natural  gas  that  we can  produce economically  and, as a result,  could have a material  adverse  effect upon our financial condition, results of operations, oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying  values of our oil and natural gas  properties.  If the oil and natural gas industry experiences significant price declines, we may, among other things, be unable to meet our financial obligations or make planned expenditures.       Since the end of 1998,  oil prices have gone from near  historic low prices to higher prices not experienced  for over ten years. At the end of 1998,  NYMEX oil prices were at historic  lows of  approximately  $12.00 per Bbl,  but during 1999 and 2000 NYMEX oil prices increased to an average of  approximately  $19.30 and $30.25 per Bbl,  respectively.  During 2001, NYMEX oil prices declined to an average of approximately $26.00 per Bbl and were at $19.84 per Bbl at the end of 2001. In 2002,  NYMEX oil prices increased to average  approximately  $26.10 per Bbl and ended the year at $31.20  per Bbl.  Throughout  2003,  NYMEX oil  prices remained at these  higher  prices,  averaging  approximately  $31.00 per Bbl and ending the year at $32.52 per Bbl.       Natural gas prices have experienced even more volatility over the same five year period. During 1999 natural gas prices averaged approximately $2.35 per Mcf and  increased  to an  average  of  approximately  $4.05  per Mcf  during  2001,                                         6 Denbury Resources Inc.   primarily  due to low storage  levels.  At December 31, 2000,  NYMEX natural gas prices were almost $10.00 per Mcf but declined  steadily during 2001 as supplies of natural gas increased.  As of year-end 2001,  natural gas prices  declined to $2.57 per Mcf.  For 2002 and  2003,  natural  gas  prices  generally  increased, averaging  approximately $3.35 and $5.45 per Mcf, respectively,  and ending 2002 at $4.79 per Mcf, and ending 2003 at $6.19 per Mcf.  Oil and Natural Gas Drilling and Producing Operations       Drilling  activities are subject to many risks,  including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. There can be no assurance that new wells  drilled by us will be  productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our  investment  in such wells.  Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve  unprofitable  efforts,  not only from dry wells but also from wells that are  productive  but do not  produce  sufficient  net  reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The seismic data and other  technologies  used by us do not provide  conclusive  knowledge,  prior to drilling  a  well,  that  oil or  natural  gas  is  present  or may be  produced economically.  The cost of drilling,  completing  and  operating a well is often uncertain,  and cost factors can  adversely  affect the  economics of a project. Further,  our drilling  operations  may be  curtailed,  delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:       o    unexpected drilling conditions;       o    title problems;       o    pressure or irregularities in formations;       o    equipment failures or accidents;       o    adverse weather conditions;       o    compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and       o    cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs,           equipment and services.       Our  operations  are  subject  to all the risks  normally  incident  to the operation and  development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including  encountering well blowouts,  cratering and explosions,   pipe  failure,   fires,   formations   with  abnormal   pressures, uncontrollable  flows of oil,  natural  gas,  brine or well  fluids,  release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental hazards and risks.       In accordance with industry  practice,  we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks  described  above in an amount we believe is adequate. However,  the nature of these risks is such that some  liabilities  could exceed our policy  limits,  or, as in the case of  environmental  fines and  penalties, cannot be insured.  We could incur  significant  costs,  related to these risks, that could have a  material  adverse  effect on our  results of  operations  and financial condition.  Use of Carbon Dioxide in Tertiary Recovery Operations       The crude oil production  from our tertiary  recovery  projects  depends on having access to sufficient  amounts of carbon  dioxide.  Our ability to produce this oil would be hindered if our supply of carbon  dioxide  were limited due to problems  with  our  current  CO2  producing  wells  and  facilities,  including compression equipment,  or catastrophic pipeline failure. Our anticipated future production is also dependent on our ability to increase the  production  volumes of CO2. If our crude oil  production  were to decline,  it could have a material adverse  effect on our financial  condition and results of  operations.  Our CO2 tertiary  recovery  projects  require a  significant  amount of  electricity  to operate the facilities. If these costs were to increase significantly,  it could have a material adverse effect upon the profitability of these operations.                                          7 Denbury Resources Inc.   Future Performance and Acquisitions       Unless we can  successfully  replace  the  reserves  that we  produce,  our reserves will decline, resulting eventually in a decrease in oil and natural gas production  and  lower  revenues  and  cash  flows  from  operations.   We  have historically  replaced reserves through both drilling and  acquisitions.  In the future we may not be able to continue to replace  reserves at acceptable  costs. The  business of exploring  for,  developing  or  acquiring  reserves is capital intensive.  We may not be  able to make  the  necessary  capital  investment  to maintain  or expand  our oil and  natural  gas  reserves  if our cash flows from operations are reduced, due to lower oil or natural gas prices or otherwise,  or if external  sources of capital  become  limited or  unavailable.  Further,  the process  of using  CO2 for  tertiary  recovery  and the  related  infrastructure requires  significant  capital  investment,  often one to two years prior to any resulting production and cash flows from these projects,  heightening  potential capital  constraints.  If  we  do  not  continue  to  make  significant  capital expenditures, or if outside capital resources become limited, we may not be able to maintain our growth rate. In addition, our drilling activities are subject to numerous  risks,  including  the risk  that no  commercially  productive  oil or natural gas reserves will be  encountered.  Exploratory  drilling  involves more risk than development  drilling because exploratory drilling is designed to test formations for which proved reserves have not been discovered.       We are continually identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities and we have successfully completed acquisitions  throughout our history.  Estimating the reserves and forecasted  production  from acquired  properties is inherently difficult  and may  result in our  inability  to achieve  or  maintain  targeted production  levels.  In that case,  our  ability to realize  the total  economic benefit  from the  acquisition  may be  reduced or  eliminated.  There can be no assurance that we will successfully  consummate any future  acquisitions or that such  acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties  will contain  economically recoverable   reserves  or  that  any  future  acquisition  will  be  profitably integrated into our operations.  Competition and Markets       We face competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of its business,  including  acquisition of producing properties and oil and gas leases,  marketing of oil and gas, and obtaining goods, services and labor. Many of our competitors  have  substantially  larger  financial and other  resources. Factors  that  affect  our  ability  to  acquire  producing  properties  include available funds,  available  information  about  prospective  properties and our standards  established  for minimum  projected  return on investment.  Gathering systems are the only practical  method for the  intermediate  transportation  of natural  gas.  Therefore,  competition  for natural gas delivery is presented by other  pipelines and gas gathering  systems.  Competition  is also  presented by alternative fuel sources,  including heating oil and other fossil fuels. Because of the  long-lived,  high  margin  nature  of  our  oil  and  gas  reserves  and management's  experience and expertise in exploiting these reserves,  we believe that we are effective in competing in the market.       The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct  field  operations,  geologists,  geophysicists,   engineers  and  other professionals  in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate  significantly, often  in  correlation  with  oil  and  natural  gas  prices,  causing  periodic shortages.  There have also been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment  has  increased  along with the number of wells being  drilled.  These  factors  also cause  significant  increases in costs for equipment,  services and personnel.  Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate  increased  demand and result in increased  prices for drilling  rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. We cannot be certain when we will experience  these issues and these types of shortages or price increases could significantly  decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results or restrict our ability to drill those wells and conduct those  operations  that we currently have planned and budgeted.  Federal and State Regulations       Numerous  federal  and state  laws and  regulations  govern the oil and gas industry. These laws and regulations are often changed in response to changes in the political or economic environment.  Compliance with this evolving regulatory burden is often difficult and costly, and substantial  penalties may be incurred for  noncompliance.  The  following  section  describes  some  specific laws and regulations  that may affect us. We cannot predict the impact of these or future legislative or regulatory initiatives.                                          8 Denbury Resources Inc.        Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with all laws and regulations  applicable to our  operations and that  continued  compliance  with existing  requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us. The future annual  capital  costs of  complying  with  the  regulations  applicable  to our operations  is  uncertain  and will be  governed by several  factors,  including future  changes  to  regulatory  requirements.   However,  management  does  not currently  anticipate  that future  compliance  will have a  materially  adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  Regulation of Natural Gas and Oil Exploration and Production       Our  operations  are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.  Such regulation includes requiring permits for drilling wells,  maintaining bonding  requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells,  the method of drilling and casing wells,  the surface use and  restoration  of  properties  upon which wells are drilled,  the plugging and  abandoning  of wells and the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations.  Our operations are also subject to various  conservation  laws and  regulations.  These  include the  regulation  of the size of  drilling  and spacing  units or proration  units and the density of wells which may be drilled in those  units and the  unitization  or pooling of oil and gas  properties.  In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas  wells,  generally  prohibit  the  venting  or flaring of gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations  may limit the amount of oil and gas we can  produce  from its wells and may limit the number of wells or the  locations  at which we can drill.  The regulatory  burden  on the oil and gas  industry  increases  our  costs of doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability.  Federal Regulation of Sales Prices and Transportation       The transportation and certain sales of natural gas in interstate  commerce are  heavily  regulated  by  agencies  of the U.S.  federal  government  and are affected by the availability,  terms and cost of transportation.  In particular, the  price  and  terms of  access to  pipeline  transportation  are  subject  to extensive  U.S.  federal and state  regulation.  The Federal  Energy  Regulatory Commission  ("FERC") is  continually  proposing and  implementing  new rules and regulations  affecting the natural gas industry.  The stated  purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote  competition among the various sectors of the  natural  gas  industry.  The  ultimate  impact  of the  complex  rules  and regulations  issued by FERC cannot be predicted.  Some of FERC's  proposals may, however,  adversely  affect the  availability  and reliability of  interruptible transportation  service on interstate  pipelines.  While our sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently subject to FERC regulation, our  ability  to  transport  and sell such  products  is  dependent  on  certain pipelines  whose  rates,  terms and  conditions  of service  are subject to FERC regulation.  Additional  proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas  industry  are  considered  from  time  to  time by  Congress,  FERC,  state regulatory  bodies  and the  courts.  We  cannot  predict  when  or if any  such proposals  might become  effective and their effect,  if any, on our operations. Historically,  the natural gas industry has been heavily  regulated;  therefore, there is no  assurance  that the less  stringent  regulatory  approach  recently pursued by FERC,  Congress and the states will  continue  indefinitely  into the future.  Natural Gas Gathering Regulations       State  regulation of natural gas gathering  facilities  generally  includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements.  Although such  regulation  has not generally  been  affirmatively applied by state agencies,  natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.  Federal, State or Indian Leases       Our  operations on federal,  state or Indian oil and gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions,  including nondiscrimination statutes. Such operations must be conducted  pursuant to certain  on-site  security  regulations and other permits and  authorizations  issued by the Bureau of Land  Management,  Minerals Management Service ("MMS") and other agencies.                                          9 Denbury Resources Inc.   Environmental Regulations       Public  interest  in  the  protection  of  the  environment  has  increased dramatically  in  recent  years.  In  addition,  over the last two years we have acquired  significant  assets offshore in the Gulf of Mexico which are regulated by the MMS. Our oil and natural gas production and saltwater disposal operations and our  processing,  handling  and  disposal of  hazardous  materials,  such as hydrocarbons  and  naturally  occurring  radioactive  materials  are  subject to stringent regulation.  We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs resulting from a release of hazardous material,  third-party claims for property damage and personal injuries fines and sanctions,  as a result of any violations or liabilities under  environmental or other laws.  Changes in or more stringent enforcement  of  environmental  laws could also result in  additional  operating costs and capital expenditures.       Various federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into  the  environment,   or  otherwise   relating  to  the  protection  of  the environment, directly impact oil and gas exploration, development and production operations,  and  consequently  may impact the Company's  operations  and costs. These regulations include,  among others, (i) regulations by the EPA and various state agencies  regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous   wastes;   (ii)   the   Comprehensive    Environmental   Response, Compensation,  and Liability Act, Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state laws which regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed  wastes  (including  wastes  disposed of or released by prior owners or operators),  property contamination (including groundwater  contamination),  and remedial plugging  operations to prevent future  contamination;  (iii) the Clean Air Act and  comparable  state and local  requirements  which may  result in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from the operations of the Company; (iv) the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 which contains numerous  requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United  States;  (v) the Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage  and  disposal  of  hazardous  wastes;  and (vi) state  regulations  and statutes  governing the handling,  treatment,  storage and disposal of naturally occurring radioactive material ("NORM").       Management  believes that we are in substantial  compliance with applicable environmental  laws and regulations.  To date, we have not expended any material amounts to comply  with such  regulations,  and  management  does not  currently anticipate that future  compliance will have a materially  adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  Estimated  Net  Quantities  of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and Present  Value of Estimated Future Net Revenues       Estimates of net proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2003,  2002 and 2001 have been prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton,  independent  petroleum engineers located in Dallas,  Texas. See Note 12,  "Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures," to the Consolidated Financial Statements and pages 9 and 10 of the  Annual  Report  for  disclosure  of  reserve  data.  Such   information  is incorporated herein by reference.       There are  numerous  uncertainties  inherent in  estimating  quantities  of proved oil and natural gas reserves  and their  values,  including  many factors beyond our control.  The reserve data included herein represents only estimates. Reserve   engineering  is  a  subjective   process  of  estimating   underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The  accuracy of any reserve  estimate is a function of the quality of available geological,  geophysical,  engineering  and economic  data, the precision of the engineering and judgment.  As a result,  estimates of different  engineers often vary.  The estimates of reserves,  future cash flows and present value are based on various  assumptions,  including those  prescribed by the SEC relating to oil and natural gas prices,  drilling and operating expenses,  capital expenditures, taxes and  availability of funds,  and are inherently  imprecise.  Actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures,  operating expenses and quantities of  recoverable  oil and natural gas reserves may vary  substantially from our estimates.  Such  variations may be  significant  and could  materially affect estimated quantities and the present value of our proved reserves.  Also, the use of a 10% discount  factor for  reporting  purposes  may not  necessarily represent the most appropriate  discount factor, given actual interest rates and risks to which  Denbury or the oil and  natural  gas  industry  in  general  are subject.                                         10 Denbury Resources Inc.        You should not assume that the present values referred to herein  represent the current  market  value of our  estimated  oil and natural gas  reserves.  In accordance  with  requirements  of the SEC, the estimates of present  values are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimates.  Actual future prices and costs may be  materially  higher or lower than the prices and cost as of the date of the estimate.       At December 31, 2003,  approximately  39% of our estimated  proved reserves are undeveloped.  Recovery of undeveloped  reserves requires significant capital expenditures and may require successful  drilling  operations.  The reserve data assumes  that  we can  and  will  make  these  expenditures  and  conduct  these operations successfully, but these assumptions may not be accurate, and this may not occur.       Quantities of proved reserves are estimated  based on economic  conditions, including oil and natural gas prices in existence at the date of assessment. Our reserves and future cash flows may be subject to revisions based upon changes in economic  conditions,  including  oil and natural gas prices,  as well as due to production  results,  results of future  development,  operating and development costs and other  factors.  Downward  revisions  of our  reserves  could  have an adverse affect on its financial condition and operating results.  Item 2.  Properties -------------------       See Item 1.  Business  - "Oil and Gas  Operations."  We also  have  various operating  leases for rental of office space,  office and field  equipment,  and vehicles. See Note "Off-Balance Sheet  Arrangements-Commitments and Obligations" in  Management's   Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  10, "Commitments and  Contingencies," to the Consolidated  Financial  Statements for the future minimum rental payments.  Such information is incorporated  herein by reference.  Item 3.  Legal Proceedings --------------------------       In  the  opinion  of  management,  there  are  no  material  pending  legal proceedings  in the ordinary  course of business to which  Denbury or any of our subsidiaries  is a party  or of  which  any of their  property  is the  subject. However,  due to the nature of its  business,  certain  legal or  administrative proceedings arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business.  See Note  10,  "Commitments  and  Contingencies,"  to  the  Consolidated   Financial Statements for further disclosure regarding legal proceedings and contingencies. Such information is incorporated herein by reference.  Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders ------------------------------------------------------------       No matters were submitted for a vote of security  holders during the fourth quarter of 2003.                                       PART II  Item 5.  Market for the Common Stock and Related Matters --------------------------------------------------------       Information  as to the markets in which  Denbury's  common stock is traded, the quarterly high and low prices for such stock during the last two years,  the restriction  on the payment of dividends  with respect to the common stock,  and the approximate  number of stockholders of record at March 1, 2004, is set forth under "Common Stock Trading Summary"  appearing on page 86 of the Annual Report. Such information is incorporated herein by reference.       As of March 1, 2004, affiliates of the Texas Pacific Group beneficially own approximately  17%  of  the  Company's   outstanding   common  stock  and  their representatives hold three of eight seats on Denbury's Board of Directors.  As a result of its ownership and provisions of our certificate of  incorporation  and bylaws,  the Texas Pacific Group has historically  had the effective  ability to elect all our  directors  and to control our  business  and  affairs,  including decisions with respect to the  acquisition or disposition of assets,  the future issuance of our common stock or other securities,  dividend policy and decisions with respect to our drilling, operating and acquisition expenditure plans. While the Texas Pacific Group owns less than 50% of our outstanding common stock, they still are our largest single  stockholder and still control such a large portion of our stock that their effective control will not be significantly  diminished. Since our certificate of  incorporation  requires a two-thirds  majority vote by the board of directors on most  significant  transactions,  such as  significant asset purchases and sales, issuances of equity and debt, changes in the board of directors and other matters,  assuming that representatives of the Texas                                         11 Denbury Resources Inc.    Pacific  Group  continue  to hold  over  one-third  of the  board  seats as they currently  do, they will still be able to veto any  decisions  on these  matters solely by themselves.  Item 6.

All  such  information  is  incorporated  herein  by reference.  Item  9.  Changes  in and  Disagreements  with  Accountants  on  Accounting  and Financial Disclosure --------------------------------------------------------------------------------       None.  Item 9A. Controls and Procedures --------------------------------       We maintain  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  internal  controls designed to ensure that  information  required  to be  disclosed  in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported  within the time  periods  specified  in the  Securities  and  Exchange Commission's  rules and forms.  Our chief executive  officer and chief financial officer have evaluated our  disclosure  controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K and have  determined  that such disclosure  controls and procedures are effective in all material  respects in  providing  to them on a timely  basis  material  information  required to be disclosed in this annual report.       There have been no changes in internal  controls over  financial  reporting during  the  period  covered  by this  annual  report  on Form  10-K  that  have materially  affected,  or are reasonably likely to materially affect,  Denbury's internal controls over financial reporting.                                      PART III  Item 10.
