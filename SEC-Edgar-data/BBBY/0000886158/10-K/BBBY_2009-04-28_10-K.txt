The Companys fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest February28. Accordingly, fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 represented 52 weeks and ended on February26, 2005, February28, 2004 and March1, 2003, respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to periods of time (e.g., quarters and years) are to fiscal periods.
ITEM 1 - BUSINESS Introduction Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) operate specialty retail stores nationwide, including stores of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBB), Harmon Stores, Inc. (Harmon) and Christmas Tree Shops, Inc. (CTS). The Company believes it is the nations largest operator of stores selling predominantly better quality domestics merchandise and home furnishings.
BBB stores are almost exclusively of a big box format. BBB offers a wide assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices that are substantially below regular department store prices and generally comparable to or below department store sale prices. BBBs domestics merchandise line includes items such as bed linens, bath accessories and kitchen textiles, and BBBs home furnishings line includes items such as cookware, dinnerware, glassware and basic housewares. BBB believes that it offers a breadth and depth of selection in most of its product categories that exceeds what is generally available in department stores or other specialty retail stores and that this enables it to offer customers the convenience of one-stop shopping for most household items.
As of February26, 2005, BBB operated 660 stores in 44 states and one territory: Alabama (8), Arizona (12), Arkansas (3), California (75), Colorado (16), Connecticut (12), Delaware (1), Florida (51), Georgia (19), Idaho (3), Illinois (29), Indiana (14), Iowa (6), Kansas (7), Kentucky (5), Louisiana (10), Maine (2), Maryland (15), Massachusetts (14), Michigan (27), Minnesota (9), Mississippi (3), Missouri (10), Nebraska (2), Nevada (5), New Hampshire (6), New Jersey (28), New Mexico (3), New York (42), North Carolina (18), North Dakota (2), Ohio (26), Oklahoma (4), Oregon (8), Pennsylvania (25), Rhode Island (3), South Carolina (12), Tennessee (14), Texas (55), Utah (9), Vermont (1), Virginia (21), Washington (15), Wisconsin (7), and Puerto Rico (3).
These stores principally range in size from 20,000 square feet to 50,000 square feet, with some exceeding 80,000 square feet, and carry BBBs full line of both domestics merchandise and home furnishings.
CTS is a retailer of giftware and household items selling a broad assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings at value prices in many categories including home dcor, giftware, housewares, food, paper goods and seasonal products. As of February26, 2005, CTS operated 26 stores in 7 states.
Harmon is a health and beauty care retailer, which operated 35 stores in 3 states as of February26, 2005.
History The Company was founded in 1971 by Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg, the Co-Chairmen of the Company. Each has more than 45 years of experience in the retail industry.
The Company commenced operations in 1971 with the opening of two stores, one in New York and one in New Jersey. These stores sold primarily bed linens and bath accessories. In 1985, the Company introduced its first store carrying a full line of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. The Company began using the name Bed Bath & Beyond in 1987 in order to reflect the expanded product line offered by its stores and to distinguish its stores from conventional specialty retail stores offering only domestics merchandise or home furnishings. In March2002, the Company entered the health and beauty care market with the acquisition of Harmon and in June2003, the Company added to its domestics merchandise and home furnishings market offerings with the acquisition of CTS.
3 The Company has been engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new BBB stores (including 85 in fiscal 2004, 85 in fiscal 2003, and 95 in fiscal 2002) and the expansion and relocation of existing BBB stores (including one in fiscal 2004, two in fiscal 2003 and two in fiscal 2002). As a result of its expansion program, BBBs store space has increased from approximately 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to approximately 21,691,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2004. The Company intends to continue its expansion program and currently plans to open new BBB, Harmon and CTS stores in fiscal 2005.
Merchandising and Marketing BBBs strategy for merchandising and marketing is to offer better quality merchandise at everyday low prices; to maintain a breadth and depth of selection in its product categories that exceeds what is generally available in department stores or other specialty retail stores; to present merchandise in a distinctive manner designed to maximize customer convenience and reinforce customer perception of wide selection; and to emphasize dedication to customer service and satisfaction.
BBB stores primarily offer domestics merchandise and home furnishings, which include: Domestics Merchandise  bed linens and related items: sheets, comforters, duvet covers, bedspreads, quilts, window treatments (such as curtains and valances), decorative pillows, blankets, dust ruffles, bed pillows and mattress pads.
bath items: towels, shower curtains and liners, waste baskets, mirrors, hampers, robes, slippers, scales, bathroom rugs, wall hardware and other bath accessories.
kitchen textiles: tablecloths, placemats, cloth napkins, dish towels and chair pads.
Home Furnishings  kitchen and tabletop items: cookware, cutlery, kitchen gadgets, dinnerware, bakeware, flatware, drinkware, serveware, glassware, food storage containers, tea kettles, trash cans and cleaning supplies.
fine tabletop and giftware: formal dinnerware china, fine crystal stemware and barware, crystal giftware, metal giftware, flatware, decanters and carafes, and decorative vases and bowls.
basic housewares: storage items, closet-related items (such as hangers, organizers and shoe racks), general housewares (such as brooms, garbage pails and ironing boards), lifestyle accessories (such as lamps, chairs, ready to assemble furniture, furniture covers, accent rugs, and clocks) and small electric appliances (such as blenders, food processors, coffee makers, vacuums, irons, toaster ovens, hair dryers, heaters and humidifiers).
general home furnishings: gift wrap, candles, personal care products (such as soaps, lotions and other health and beauty care items), picture frames, wall art, juvenile items (such as toys and childrens books), artificial plants and flowers and seasonal merchandise (such as summer and holiday-related items).
BBB, on an ongoing basis, tests new merchandise categories and adjusts the categories of merchandise carried in its stores and may add new departments or adjust the size of existing departments as required. BBB believes that the process of adding new departments and expanding or reducing the size of various departments in response to changing conditions is an important part of its merchandising strategy.
BBBs merchandise consists primarily of better quality merchandise typically found at better department stores. For those product lines that have brand names associated with them, BBB generally offers leading brand name merchandise (including Aero, All-Clad, American Pacific, Braun, Calphalon, Conair, Croscill, Cuisinart, J.A. Henckels, Homedics, KitchenAid, Krups, Laura Ashley, Lenox, Mikasa, Nambe, Nautica, Nicole Miller, Noritake, Oxo, Portmeirion, Rowenta, Rubbermaid, Springs, Villeroy & Boch, Wamsutta, Wedgewood, Westpoint Stevens and Yankee Candle).
4 BBB offers a breadth and depth of product selection that enables customers to select among a wide assortment of styles, brands, colors and designs within each of BBBs major product lines. BBB also generally maintains consistent in-stock availability of merchandise in order to reinforce customer perception of wide selection and build customer loyalty.
Pricing Policy BBBs pricing policy is to maintain everyday low prices that are substantially below regular department store prices and generally comparable to or below department store sale prices. BBB regularly monitors price levels at its competitors in order to ensure that BBBs prices are being maintained in accordance with its pricing policy. BBB believes that the application of its everyday low price policy is essential to maintaining the integrity of this policy and is an important factor in establishing its reputation among customers.
Because BBB has an everyday low price policy, BBB does not run sales. However, BBB uses periodic markdowns and semi-annual clearances for merchandise that it has decided to discontinue carrying. In addition, BBBs full-color circulars and mailing pieces include a coupon, which may be redeemed at the point-of-sale. BBB also honors competitor coupons.
Merchandise Presentation BBB has developed a distinctive style of merchandise presentation. In each store, groups of related product lines are presented together in separate areas of the store, creating the appearance that a BBB store is comprised of several individual specialty stores for different product lines. A racetrack layout that runs throughout the store facilitates moving between areas and encourages customers to shop the entire store. BBB believes that its format of merchandise presentation makes it easy for customers to locate products, reinforces customer perception of wide selection and communicates to customers that BBB stores offer a level of customer service generally associated with smaller specialty stores.
Merchandise is displayed in each of these separate areas from floor to ceiling (generally 10 to 14 feet high) and, in addition, seasonal merchandise and impulse items are prominently displayed in the front of the store. BBB believes that its extensive merchandise selection, rather than fixturing, should be the focus of customer attention and, accordingly, typically uses simple modular fixturing throughout the store. This fixturing is designed so that it can be easily reconfigured to adapt to changes in the stores merchandise mix and presentation. BBB believes that its floor to ceiling displays create an exciting and attractive shopping environment that encourages impulse purchases of additional items.
Customer Service The Company places a strong focus on customer service, with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback, and has made this a defining feature of its corporate culture. All managers provide leadership by example in this area by regularly spending time assisting customers on the selling floor.
The Company seeks to make shopping at its stores as pleasant and convenient as possible. Each area within a BBB store is staffed with knowledgeable sales associates who are available to assist customers in choosing merchandise, to answer questions and to resolve any issues that may arise. In order to make checking out convenient, checkout lines are continually monitored and additional cashiers are added as necessary in order to minimize waiting time. Most BBB stores are open seven days (and six evenings) a week in order to enable customers to shop at times that are convenient for them.
BBBs website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, which customers can generally access 24 hours a day, seven days a week, offers a broad range of online services and features, including online shopping and gift registry. BBB believes that its E-Service efforts have been well received by its customers.
5 Advertising In general, the Company relies on word of mouth advertising and its reputation for offering a wide assortment of quality merchandise at everyday low prices, supplemented by the use of paid advertising. The Company mails full-color circulars and other advertising pieces as its primary vehicles of paid advertising. Also, to support the opening of new stores, the Company uses grand opening full-color circulars and newspaper advertising. The Company believes that its ability to rely primarily on word of mouth advertising will continue and that its limited use of paid advertising permits it to spend less on advertising than a number of its competitors.
Expansion Program The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets and the expansion or relocation of existing stores. In the thirteen year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2004 the BBB chain has grown from 34 stores to 660 stores. Total BBB square footage grew from approximately 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to approximately 21,691,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, BBB opened 85 new stores and relocated one store which resulted in the addition of approximately 2,338,000 square feet of store space. Harmon has grown from 27 stores, upon acquisition in 2002 , to 35 stores, with the addition of five stores and the relocation of one store in fiscal 2004, and occupied approximately 240,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2004. CTS has grown from 23 stores, upon acquisition in 2003, to 26 stores, with the addition of two stores in fiscal 2004, and occupied approximately 1,014,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2004.
The table below sets forth information concerning BBBs expansion program for the periods indicated: Store Space Number of Stores Relocated New Closed Beginning End Beginning End Year Stores (1) Stores (2) Stores of Year of Year of Year of Year (in square feet) 1992 5 4 0 917,000 1,128,000 34 38 1993 4 9 2 1,128,000 1,512,000 38 45 1994 4 16 0 1,512,000 2,339,000 45 61 1995 2 19 0 2,339,000 3,214,000 61 80 1996 2 28 0 3,214,000 4,347,000 80 108 1997 3 33 0 4,347,000 5,767,000 108 141 1998 3 45 0 5,767,000 7,688,000 141 186 1999 4 55 0 7,688,000 9,815,000 186 241 2000 2 70 0 9,815,000 12,204,000 241 311 2001 0 85 0 12,204,000 14,724,000 311 396 2002 2 95 1 14,724,000 17,255,000 396 490 2003 2 85 0 17,255,000 19,353,000 490 575 2004 1 85 0 19,353,000 21,691,000 575 660 (1) A relocated store is an existing store that was relocated to a new location in the same area.
(2) Excludes any relocated store.
The Company intends to continue its expansion program and believes that the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, on the success of this program. As part of its expansion program, the Company expects to open new stores and, in addition, expects to expand existing stores as opportunities arise.
The Company expects to open new stores in new and existing markets. In determining where to open new BBB stores, the Company evaluates a number of factors, including the availability of prime real estate and demographic information (such as data relating to income and education levels, age and occupation). The Company believes that because BBB does not use central distribution centers, and since BBB relies on paid advertising to only a limited extent, it has the flexibility to enter a new market with only one or two BBB stores.
The Company will consider opening additional stores in that market after the stores have been proven successful. The Company currently plans to open new BBB, Harmon and CTS stores in fiscal 2005.
6 The Company has built its management structure with a view toward its expansion and believes that, as a result, the Company has the management depth necessary to support its anticipated expansion program. Each of BBBs area managers typically supervises up to three BBB stores and district managers typically supervise four to ten stores.
Store Operations Merchandising BBB maintains its own central buying group. The merchandise mix for each BBB store is initially selected by the central buying group, in consultation with store managers and other local store personnel. The central buying group is generally responsible for the procurement of merchandise, including: selecting the merchandise, ordering the initial inventory required upon the opening of each BBB store, ordering the first shipment of any new product line that may be subsequently added to a stores merchandise mix and ordering seasonal merchandise.
After a BBB store is opened, local store personnel are primarily responsible for monitoring inventory levels and reordering merchandise as required. In addition, local store personnel are encouraged to monitor local sales trends and market conditions and tailor the merchandise mix as appropriate to respond to changing trends and conditions. The Company believes that its policy of having the reordering function for BBB stores performed at the local store level, rather than centrally, and having local store personnel determine the appropriate quantity to reorder, encourages entrepreneurship at the store level. In addition, this better ensures that in-stock availability will be maintained in accordance with the specific requirements of each store. The factors taken into account in selecting the merchandise mix for a particular BBB store include store size and configuration and local market conditions such as climate and demographics.
The Company purchases its merchandise from approximately 3,700 suppliers. In fiscal 2004, the Companys largest supplier accounted for approximately 4% of the Companys merchandise purchases and the Companys 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 21% of such purchases. The Company purchases substantially all of its merchandise in the United States, the majority from domestic sources and the balance from importers. The Company purchases a small amount of its merchandise directly from overseas sources.
The Company has no long-term contracts for the purchase of merchandise. The Company believes that most merchandise, other than brand name goods, is available from a variety of sources and that most brand name goods can be replaced with comparable merchandise.
Warehousing Merchandise is primarily shipped directly to each BBB store from its vendors, making it unnecessary for BBB to maintain central distribution centers. As a result of the floor to ceiling displays typically used by BBB, a substantial amount of merchandise is displayed on the sales floor of each store at all times. Additional merchandise not displayed on the sales floor is stored in warehouse space within or near the store (with an estimated 10% to 15% of the BBB store space dedicated to warehouse and receiving space). In the case of a few stores, merchandise is also stored at nearby supplemental storage space leased by the Company. At present, the warehouse space included in BBBs stores provides approximately 87% of BBBs warehouse space requirements and such nearby supplemental storage space provides the balance.
CTS and Harmon maintain central distribution centers of approximately 537,000 and 80,000 square feet, respectively. These distribution centers are responsible for shipping the majority of merchandise to their respective stores.
7 Management The Company encourages responsiveness and entrepreneurship at the store level by providing its managers with a relatively high degree of autonomy relating to operations and merchandising. This is reflected in the Companys policy of encouraging managers to tailor the merchandise mix of each store in response to local sales trends and market conditions.
On average, BBB stores are staffed with two assistant managers, one operations manager, and three to six department managers who all report to a store manager. The store manager, in turn, reports to an area or district manager. Area and district managers report to one of several regional managers or directly to one of five regional Vice Presidents of Stores, who in turn report to the Senior Vice President - Stores.
Training The Company places great emphasis on the training of store level management. All entry-level management personnel are generally required to work in various departments of the store to acquire an overall understanding of store operations. In addition, all BBB store associates receive formalized training, including sales techniques and product knowledge, through the Bed Bath & Beyond University program.
The Companys policy is to generally build its management organization from within. Each of the Companys area, district and regional managers was recruited from the ranks of the Companys store managers and each of the Companys store managers joined the Company in an entry-level position. The Company believes that its policy of promoting from within, as well as the opportunities for advancement generated by its ongoing expansion program, serve as incentives to persons to seek and retain employment with the Company, and result in low turnover among its managers.
Employees As of February26, 2005, the Company employed approximately 31,000 persons, of whom approximately 16,000 were full-time employees and approximately 15,000 were part-time employees. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are excellent and that the labor turnover rate among its management employees is lower than that generally experienced within the industry.
Seasonality The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in August, Novemberand December, and generally lower in Februaryand March.
Inflation The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance; however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future.
Competition The market for domestics merchandise and home furnishings is fragmented and highly competitive. While the Company believes it is the preeminent marketer in its segment of the home goods industry, its BBB stores compete directly with a small number of store chains selling domestics merchandise and home furnishings. In addition, BBB stores compete with many different types of retail stores that sell many or most of the same products. Such competitors include: (i) better department stores, which often carry many of the same product lines as BBB stores but do not typically have the same depth or breadth of product selection, (ii)specialty stores (such as specialty linens or housewares retailers), which often have a depth of product selection but typically carry only a limited 8 portion of the product lines carried by BBB stores (iii)discount and mass merchandise stores and (iv) national chains. In addition, BBB stores compete, to a more limited extent, with factory outlet stores that typically offer limited quantities or limited lines of better quality merchandise at discount prices.
The Company believes that it is the largest operator of stores selling predominantly better quality domestics merchandise and home furnishings typically found in better department stores, and that it is well positioned to compete successfully in its markets as measured by several factors, including pricing, breadth and quality of product selection, in-stock availability of merchandise, effective merchandise presentation, customer service and store locations.
The visibility of the Company has encouraged competitors to imitate BBB stores format and methods. Other retail chains continue to introduce new store concepts that include many of the product lines carried by BBB stores. There can be no assurance that the operation of store competitors, including those companies operating stores similar to those of BBB, will not have a material effect on the Company.
Tradenames and Service Marks The Company uses the nationally recognized Bed Bath & Beyond name and logo and the Beyond any store of its kind tag line as service marks in connection with retail services. The Company has registered these marks and others, including names and logos of Harmon and CTS, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company also has registered or has applications pending with the trademark registries of several foreign countries. Management believes that its name recognition and service marks are important elements of the Companys merchandising strategy.
Available Information The Company makes available as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, free of charge, through its website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, the Companys annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, electronically filed or furnished pursuant to Section13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

11 The Company also leases supplemental merchandise storage space in eleven locations totaling approximately 412,000 square feet servicing BBB stores and in one location of approximately 80,000 square feet servicing Harmon stores. This space is used to supplement the warehouse facilities in the Companys stores in proximity to these locations. One of these locations also provides fulfillment for BBBs E-Service activities. In addition, the Company owns a distribution center of approximately 537,000 square feet servicing CTS stores. See Item 1 BusinessStore OperationsWarehousing.
The Company also leases a combined total of 270,000 square feet in three locations (Union, New Jersey; Farmingdale, New York; and South Yarmouth, Massachusetts) for its corporate office and procurement functions.

14 ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) operate specialty retail stores nationwide, including stores of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBB), Harmon Stores, Inc. (Harmon) and Christmas Tree Shops, Inc. (CTS), primarily selling predominantly better quality domestics merchandise and home furnishings. The Companys objective is to be a customers first choice for products and services in the categories offered, in the markets in which the Company operates.
The Companys strategy is to achieve this objective through excellent customer service, an extensive breadth and depth of assortment, everyday low prices, introduction of new merchandising offerings and development of our infrastructure.
Operating in the highly competitive retail industry, the Company, along with other retail companies, is influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, consumer preferences and spending habits, competition from existing and potential competitors, unusual weather patterns and the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program.
In fiscal 2004, the Companys consolidated net sales increased by 15.0% and net earnings increased by 26.4% .
Contributing to this increase was the expansion of BBB store space by 12.1%, from 19,353,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2003 to 21,691,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2004. The 2,338,000 square feet increase was primarily the result of opening 85 new BBB stores and relocating one existing store.
Also contributing to this increase in fiscal 2004 was an acquisition made by the Company in June 2003. The Company acquired CTS in fiscal 2003 for approximately $194.4 million, net of cash acquired, including the costs of the acquisition, comprising $175.5 million of cash and $18.9 million in deferred payments payable in cash over three years. CTS is a retailer of giftware and household items selling a broad assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings at value prices in many categories including home dcor, giftware, housewares, food, paper goods and seasonal products. CTS results of operations are included in the Companys consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition.
Comparable store sales for fiscal 2004 increased by approximately 4.5% as compared with an increase of approximately 6.3% and 7.9% in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. As of the beginning of the fiscal third quarter of 2004, CTS was included in the calculation of comparable store sales. The fiscal 2004 increase in comparable store sales reflected a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings and a strong focus on customer service with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback.
A store is considered a comparable store when it has been open for twelve full months following its grand opening period (typically four to six weeks). Stores relocated or expanded are excluded from comparable store sales if the change in square footage would cause meaningful disparity in sales over the prior period. In the case of a store to be closed, such stores sales are not considered comparable once the store closing process has commenced.
The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long-term objectives.
15 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated (i)selected statement of earnings data of the Company expressed as a percentage of net sales and (ii)the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of earnings data: Fiscal Year Ended Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change from Prior Year February 26, 2005 February 28, 2004 March 1, 2003 February 26, 2005 February 28, 2004 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 15.0 % 22.2 % Cost of sales 57.5 58.1 58.6 13.8 21.2 Gross profit 42.5 41.9 41.4 16.5 23.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 27.1 27.6 28.3 12.7 19.1 Operating profit 15.4 14.3 13.1 23.9 33.2 Earnings before provision for income taxes 15.8 14.5 13.4 24.9 32.2 Net earnings 9.8 8.9 8.2 26.4 32.2 Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2004 increased $669.7 million to $5.148 billion, representing an increase of 15.0% over the $4.478 billion of net sales in fiscal 2003, which increased $812.8 million or 22.2% over net sales of $3.665 billion in fiscal 2002. Approximately 56% of the increase in fiscal 2004 was attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales, approximately 15% of the increase was attributable to the net sales of CTS (acquired on June19, 2003) and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in comparable store sales. The increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2004 of 4.5% was due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings and a strong focus on customer service with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback. For fiscal 2003, approximately 41% of the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in BBBs new store sales, approximately 34% of the increase was attributable to the net sales of CTS and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in comparable store sales.
Sales of domestics merchandise accounted for approximately 48%, 51% and 55% of net sales in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of which the Company estimates that bed linens accounted for approximately 17%, 16% and 19% of net sales in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The remaining net sales in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 of 52%, 49% and 45%, respectively, represented sales of home furnishings. The change in the product mix between fiscal 2004 and 2003 and between fiscal 2003 and 2002 is primarily the result of the acquisition of CTS in June2003.
No other individual product category accounted for 10% or more of net sales during fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002.
Gross Profit Gross profit in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $2.186 billion or 42.5% of net sales, $1.877 billion or 41.9% of net sales and $1.519 billion or 41.4% of net sales, respectively. The increase in gross profit between fiscal 2004 and 2003 as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the reduction of inventory acquisition costs of the Companys current merchandise offerings. The increase in gross profit between fiscal 2003 and 2002 as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to improvements in both the markup and in markdowns taken.
16 Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $1.394 billion or 27.1% of net sales in fiscal 2004 compared to $1.237 billion or 27.6% of net sales in fiscal 2003. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales primarily reflects a relative decrease in payroll and payroll related items, occupancy costs and other expenses, which primarily resulted from the comparable store sales increase. The above relative decreases were partially offset by a relative increase in net advertising costs.
SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased to 27.6% in fiscal 2003 from 28.3% in fiscal 2002 primarily as a result of a relative decrease in occupancy costs, other store expenses and costs associated with new store openings, partially offset by a relative increase in litigation expense and net advertising costs. SG&A in fiscal 2003 was $1.237 billion as compared to $1.038 billion in fiscal 2002.
Operating Profit Operating profit increased to $792.4 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $639.3 million in fiscal 2003. The improvements in operating profit were a result of the increase in net sales and a relative increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales and a relative decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, as discussed above.
Interest income Interest income increased to $18.8 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $10.2 million in fiscal 2003 due to an increase in the cash invested and an increase in the Companys average investment interest rate as a result of the recent upward trend in short term interest rates.
Interest income decreased in fiscal 2003 from $11.3 million in fiscal 2002 due to the decrease in the average investment interest rate partially offset by an increase in the cash invested.
Income taxes The effective tax rate was 37.75% for fiscal 2004 and 38.50% for fiscal 2003 and 2002. The decrease is due to a reduction in the weighted average effective tax rate resulting from a change in the mix of the business within the taxable jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
EXPANSION PROGRAM The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets and the expansion or relocation of existing stores. In the thirteen year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2004, the chain has grown from 34 to 660 BBB stores. Total BBB stores square footage grew from 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to 21,691,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2004. There were 35 Harmon stores with 240,000 square feet and 26 CTS stores with 1,014,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2004.
The Company intends to continue its expansion program and currently plans to open new BBB, Harmon and CTS stores in fiscal 2005 (see details under Liquidity and Capital Resources below). The Company believes that a predominant portion of any increase in its net sales in fiscal 2005 will continue to be attributable to new store net sales. Accordingly, the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, upon the Companys ability to execute its expansion program successfully, of which there can be no assurance.
17 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company has been able to finance its operations, including its expansion program, through internally generated funds. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2004 was $616.4 million, compared with $548.4 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income and the timing of certain liability payments, partially offset by an increase in merchandise inventories (primarily the result of new store space) and the reduction of the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options.
Inventory per square foot was $50.21 as of February26, 2005 and $49.45 as of February28, 2004. The Company continues to focus on optimizing inventory productivity while maintaining appropriate in-store merchandise levels to support sales growth.
Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2004 was $363.0 million compared with $687.2 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was attributable to an increase in redemptions of investment securities and the payment for the acquisition of CTS in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in purchases of investment securities.
Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2004 was $325.7 million, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $53.4 million in fiscal 2003. The change in net cash resulting from financing activities was primarily attributable to the repurchase of common stock and a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
At February26, 2005, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million and $50 million, with expiration dates of September3, 2005 and February28, 2005, respectively.
Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2004, the Company increased the amount of the $50 million uncommitted line of credit to $75 million and extended the expiration to February28, 2006.
These uncommitted lines of credit are currently used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. It is the Companys intent to maintain an uncommitted line of credit for this purpose. During fiscal 2004, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of February26, 2005, there was approximately $13.4 million of outstanding letters of credit. In addition, under the above uncommitted lines of credit, the Company can obtain unsecured standby letters of credit. As of February26, 2005, there was approximately $38.1 million of outstanding unsecured standby letters of credit, primarily for certain insurance programs. The Company believes that during fiscal 2005, internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund its operations, including its expansion program.
The Company has contractual obligations consisting mainly of operating leases for stores, offices, warehouse facilities and equipment, purchase obligations and deferred acquisition payments which are payable as of February26, 2005 as follows: (in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years Operating Lease Obligations $ 2,983,765 $ 308,698 $ 947,078 $ 551,409 $ 1,176,580 Purchase Obligations 512,369 512,369    Deferred Acquisition Payments 13,334 6,667 6,667   Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,509,468 $ 827,734 $ 953,745 $ 551,409 $ 1,176,580 As of February26, 2005, the Company has leased sites for 69 new stores planned for opening in fiscal 2005 or 2006, for which aggregate minimum rental payments over the term of the leases are approximately $459.8 million and are included in the table above.
Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise and capital expenditures.
18 Other significant commitments and contingencies include the following:  The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability.
Some of the Companys operating lease agreements have scheduled rent increases. The Company accounts for these scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the expected lease term, beginning when the Company obtains possession of the premises, thus creating deferred rent.
The Company has a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for CTS employees who meet specified age and length of service requirements. The Company intends to make a minimum contribution of approximately $2.3 million during fiscal 2005.
SEASONALITY The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in August, Novemberand Decemberand generally lower in Februaryand March.
INFLATION The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). SFAS No. 123R will require companies to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires additional accounting and disclosure related to income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share-based payment arrangements.
On April 14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission delayed the effective date of adoption of SFAS No. 123R to the beginning of the first annual period after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the delayed effective date in determining the timing of adopting SFAS No. 123R.
REVISED APPROACH TO COMPENSATION On April20, 2005, the Compensation Committee made awards to executive officers and other executives reporting to the Companys Chief Executive Officer consisting of a combination of restricted stock and stock option grants. Consistent with past practice, the stock options granted to these executives will vest over time, subject, in general, to the executives remaining in the Companys employ on specified vesting dates. Vesting of the restricted stock awarded to these executives will be dependent on (i) the Companys achievement of a performance-based test for the fiscal year of grant, and (ii) assuming achievement of the performance-based test, time vesting, subject, in general, to the executive remaining in the Companys employ on specified vesting dates.
The Companys other employees who traditionally have received stock option grants have begun to receive awards consisting solely of restricted stock. Vesting of the restricted stock awarded to these employees will be based solely on time vesting with no performance test. The Company will record an expense related to the restricted stock program in fiscal 2005 in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
19 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as the provision for sales returns, inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, income taxes and accruals for self insurance, litigation and store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Sales Returns : Sales returns, which are reserved for based on historical experience, are provided for in the period that the related sales are recorded. Although the estimate for sales returns has not varied materially from historical provisions, actual experience could vary from historical experience in the future if the level of sales return activity changes materially. In the future, if the Company concludes that an adjustment to the sales returns accrual is required, the reserve will be adjusted accordingly.
Inventory Valuation : Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB and Harmon are calculated using the retail inventory method and inventory cost for CTS is calculated using the first-in, first-out cost method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.
At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Factors considered in estimating realizable value include the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions.
The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year, based on historical shrinkage. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year-end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory count. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss would be recognized during that period. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The Company has not historically had any material impairment of long-lived assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated cash flows generated by the Companys long-lived assets to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets: The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
20 Income Taxes : The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
Self Insurance : The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
Litigation : The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates as appropriate. The Company cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings.
Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs : Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including estimates for markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which was effective for any exit or disposal activity initiated after December31, 2002, costs related to store relocations and closings were provided for in the period in which management approved the relocation or closing of a store. Actual costs related to store relocations and closings could differ from these estimates.
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10-K and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements as a result of many factors that may be outside the Companys control. Such factors include, without limitation: general economic conditions, changes in the retailing environment and consumer spending habits, demographics and other macroeconomic factors that may impact the level of spending for the types of merchandise sold by the Company; unusual weather patterns; competition from existing and potential competitors; competition from other channels of distribution; pricing pressures; the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program; and the cost of labor, merchandise and other costs and expenses.

25 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and Subsidiaries 1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED MATTERS A.
Nature of Operations Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) operate specialty retail stores nationwide, including stores of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBB), Harmon Stores, Inc. (Harmon) and Christmas Tree Shops, Inc. (CTS) primarily selling predominantly better quality domestics merchandise and home furnishings. As the Company operates in the retail industry, its results of operations are affected by general economic conditions and consumer spending habits.
B.
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
C.
Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest February28. Accordingly, fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 represented 52 weeks and ended on February26, 2005, February28, 2004 and March1, 2003, respectively.
D.
Segments The Company accounts for its operations as one operating segment.
E.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as the provision for sales returns, inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, vendor allowances, income taxes and accruals for self insurance, litigation and store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
F.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN No. 47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. This interpretation requires companies to recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset-retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN No. 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December15, 2005.
26 The Company does not believe that the adoption of FIN No. 47 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In November2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 amends the guidance to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversions be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In December2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN No. 46R replaces FIN No. 46 and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities. The provisions of FIN No. 46R are effective for the first reporting period that ends after December15, 2003 for variable interests in those entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities. Application of the provisions of FIN No. 46R for all other entities is effective for the first reporting period ending after March15, 2004. The adoption of FIN No. 46R did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In November2003, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Forces (EITF) consensus on Issue 03-10, Application of EITF Issue No. 02-16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers which amends EITF 02-16, Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor. This consensus requires that if certain criteria are met, consideration received by a reseller in the form of reimbursement from a vendor for honoring the vendors sales incentives offered to consumers, such as manufacturers coupons and rebates offered to consumers, should not be recorded as a reduction of the cost of the resellers purchases from the vendor. The Company adopted EITF 03-10 at the beginning of fiscal 2004. The adoption of EITF 03-10 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
G.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, accounts payable and certain other liabilities. The Companys investment securities consist of held-to-maturity debt securities which are stated at amortized cost and available-for-sale debt securities which are stated at their approximate fair value. The book value of all financial instruments is representative of their fair values with the exception of investment securities (see Note 5  Investment Securities).
H.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
I.
Investment Securities Investment securities consist of auction rate securities, U.S. Government Agency debt securities and municipal debt securities.
Auction rate securities are securities with interest rates that reset periodically through an auction process. Auction rate securities are classified as available-for-sale and are stated at cost or par value which approximates fair value due to interest rates which reset periodically, typically within 28 days. As a result, there are no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains or losses relating to these auction rate securities. All income from these investments is recorded as interest income for each of the periods presented. The Company previously classified auction rate securities as cash and cash equivalents. The Company reclassified $530.5 million of auction rate securities reported as cash and cash equivalents as of February28, 2004 to short term investment securities.
27 All other investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until maturity and are stated at amortized cost.
Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted over the life of the security as adjustments to interest income using the effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
J.
Inventory Valuation Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB and Harmon are calculated using the retail inventory method and inventory cost for CTS is calculated using the first-in, first-out cost method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.
At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Factors considered in estimating realizable value include the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions.
The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year, based on historical shrinkage. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year-end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory count. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile.
K.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (forty years for buildings; five to fifteen years for furniture, fixtures and equipment; and three to five years for computer equipment and software). Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful life or the life of the lease.
The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to earnings as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs amounted to $51.4 million, $44.5 million and $34.7 million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
L.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss would be recognized during that period. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The Company has not historically had any material impairment of long-lived assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated cash flows generated by the Companys long-lived assets to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
M.
Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not 28 historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Included within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of February26, 2005 and February28, 2004 is $19.9 million for the tradename of CTS (see Note 2 - Acquisitions) which is not subject to amortization.
N.
Self Insurance The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
O.
Litigation The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates as appropriate. The Company cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings.
P.
Deferred Rent The Company accounts for scheduled rent increases contained in its leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Historically, the Companys method of accounting defined the beginning of the lease term as the date the Company commenced lease payments. In fiscal 2004, due to clarification by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company changed its method of accounting to define the beginning of the lease term as the date the Company obtained possession of the leased premises. This change in the Companys method of accounting did not have a material impact on the Companys fiscal 2003 and prior consolidated financial statements. Deferred rent amounted to $42.6 million and $32.7 million as of February26, 2005 and February28, 2004, respectively.
Q.
Treasury Stock In December2004, the Board of Directors approved a $350 million share repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of shares of its common stock. The Company was authorized to make repurchases from time to time in the open market pursuant to existing rules and regulations and other parameters approved by the Board. The Company repurchased 8,762,300 shares for approximately $350 million during fiscal 2004. The program was completed prior to the end of the fiscal year .
R.
Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at our retail stores or when shipped for products purchased from our websites. The value of point of sale coupons and point of sale rebates that result in a reduction of the price paid by the customer are recorded as a reduction of sales. Shipping and handling fees that are billed to a customer in a sale transaction are recorded in sales. Revenues from gift cards, gift certificates and merchandise credits are recognized when redeemed.
29 Sales returns, which are reserved for based on historical experience, are provided for in the period that the related sales are recorded. Although the estimate for sales returns has not varied materially from historical provisions, actual experience could vary from historical experience in the future if the level of sales return activity changes materially. In the future, if the Company concludes that an adjustment to the sales returns accrual is required, the reserve will be adjusted accordingly.
For fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, the provision for sales returns was $1.2 million, $1.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, and no deductions were made to the reserve for sales returns. In fiscal 2003, a reserve of approximately $0.5 million was assumed in the acquisition of CTS. As of February26, 2005, February28, 2004 and March1, 2003, the reserve for sales returns was $11.9 million, $10.7 million and $8.9 million, respectively.
S.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise, buying costs and costs of our distribution network including inbound freight charges, distribution facility costs, receiving costs and internal transfer costs.
T.
Vendor Allowances The Company receives allowances from vendors in the normal course of business for various reasons including direct cooperative advertising, purchase volume and reimbursement for other expenses. Annual terms for each allowance include the basis for earning the allowance and payment terms which vary by agreement. Prior to the adoption of EITF 02-16, allowances were recorded as either a reduction of inventory cost, an advertising expense or a sales incentive. After adopting EITF 02-16, which was effective for all new vendor allowances, including modifications of existing allowances, entered into after December31, 2002, all vendor allowances are recorded as a reduction of inventory cost, except for direct cooperative advertising allowances which are specific, incremental and identifiable. The Company recognizes purchase volume allowances as a reduction of the cost of inventory in the quarter in which milestones are achieved. Advertising costs were reduced by direct cooperative allowances of $8.7 million and $9.5 million for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively.
U.
Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including estimates for markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which was effective for any exit or disposal activity initiated after December31, 2002, costs related to store relocations and closings were provided for in the period in which management approved the relocation or closing of a store. Actual costs related to store relocations and closings could differ from these estimates.
V.
Advertising Costs Expenses associated with store advertising are charged to earnings as incurred. Net advertising costs amounted to $134.5 million, $93.7 million and $58.8 million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
W.
Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return. Income tax returns are filed with each state and territory in which the Company conducts business.
The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
30 Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
X.
Earnings per Share The Company presents earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis. Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding including the dilutive effect of stock options.
Options for which the exercise price was greater than the average market price of common shares as of the fiscal years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. These consisted of options totaling 2,766,430, 543,750 and 158,925 shares, respectively.
Y.
Stock-Based Compensation As permitted under SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, the Company has elected not to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for its stock-based compensation plans, but continues to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company has complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized in connection with the Companys stock option plans. Set forth below are the Companys net earnings and net earnings per share as reported, and as if compensation cost had been recognized (pro forma) in accordance with the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 148: 31 FISCAL YEAR (in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 NET EARNINGS: As reported $ 504,964 $ 399,470 $ 302,179 Deduct: Total stock-based employee   compensation expense determined under fair value based method, net of related   tax effects (34,686 ) (29,372 ) (25,443 ) Pro forma $ 470,278 $ 370,098 $ 276,736 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE: Basic: As reported $ 1.68 $ 1.35 $ 1.03 Pro forma $ 1.56 $ 1.25 $ 0.94 Diluted: As reported $ 1.65 $ 1.31 $ 1.00 Pro forma $ 1.55 $ 1.23 $ 0.92 The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: FISCAL YEAR 2004 2003 2002 Expected lives (years) 6.1 5.9 7.0 Expected volatility 42.00 % 45.00 % 45.00 % Risk free interest rates 3.89 % 2.96 % 4.72 % Dividend yield    Weighted average fair value of options   granted during the year $ 17.16 $ 16.29 $ 17.15 On December16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). SFAS No. 123R will require companies to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires additional accounting and disclosure related to income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share-based payment arrangements.
On April14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission delayed the effective date of adoption of SFAS No. 123R to the beginning of the first annual period after June15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the delayed effective date in determining the timing of adopting SFAS No. 123R.
32 Z.
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the fiscal 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements to conform to the fiscal 2004 consolidated financial statement presentation.
2.
ACQUISITIONS On June19, 2003, the Company acquired CTS. CTS is a retailer of giftware and household items selling a broad assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings at value prices in many categories including home dcor, giftware, housewares, food, paper goods and seasonal products. The results of CTS operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. At the date of acquisition, CTS, headquartered in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts, operated 23 stores in 6 states.
The aggregate all cash purchase price, including the costs of the acquisition, was approximately $194.4 million, net of cash acquired, comprising $175.5 million of cash and $18.9 million in deferred payments payable in cash over three years.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES The Companys investment securities consist of available-for-sale auction rate securities, which are stated at cost or par value which approximates fair value, and held-to-maturity U.S. Government Agency debt securities and municipal debt securities, which are stated at amortized cost. The amortized cost and fair value of the Companys available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities are as follows: February 26, 2005 February 28, 2004 (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Available-for-sale securities: Short term $ 360.8 $ 360.8 $ 553.5 $ 553.5 Long term 14.9 14.9 12.4 12.4 375.7 375.7 565.9 565.9 Held-to-maturity securities: Short term 268.5 266.9 18.6 18.6 Long term 309.3 307.1 198.4 199.1 577.8 574.0 217.0 217.7 Total investment securities $ 953.5 $ 949.7 $ 782.9 $ 783.6 Those investment securities with contractual maturity dates or interest reset dates within one year are classified as short term investment securities. All other investment securities are classified as long term investment securities. The contractual maturity dates of held-to-maturity investment securities extend to January2018 and the available-for-sale investment securities do not have stated contractual maturities due to the nature of the investment vehicle. Actual maturities could differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call certain obligations.
As of February26, 2005, the Company had gross unrecognized holding losses of $3.9 million relating to held-to-maturity investment securities with fair values totaling $567.9 million. None of these investment securities have been in a continuous unrecognized loss position for more than 12 months. Unrecognized holding losses typically will not result in a recognized expense if the underlying securities are held to maturity as intended. As of February28, 2004, there were no material gross unrecognized holding losses. Gross unrecognized holding gains relating to held-to-maturity investment securities were not material as of February26, 2005 and February28, 2004. As of February26, 2005 and February28, 2004, the Company had no cumulative unrecognized holding gains or losses relating to its available-for-sale investment securities.

TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES WITH RELATED PARTIES A.
In fiscal 2002, the Company had an interest in certain life insurance policies on the lives of its Co-Chairmen and their spouses. The beneficiaries of these policies were related to the aforementioned individuals. The Companys interest in these policies was equivalent to the net premiums paid by the Company. Since the Company is no longer permitted to pay policy premiums due to restrictions in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the agreements relating to the Companys interest in the life insurance policies on the lives of its Co-Chairmen and their spouses were terminated in fiscal 2003. Upon termination in fiscal 2003, the Co-Chairmen paid to the Company $5.4 million, representing the total amount of premiums paid by the Company under the agreements and the Company was released from its contractual obligation to make substantial future premium payments. In order to confer a benefit to its Co-Chairmen in substitution for the aforementioned terminated agreements, the Company has agreed to pay to the Co-Chairmen, at a future date, an aggregate amount of $4.2 million, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of February26, 2005 and February28, 2004.

STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLANS During fiscal 2004, the Company adopted the Bed Bath & Beyond 2004 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2004 Plan). The 2004 Plan is a flexible compensation plan that enables the Company to offer incentive compensation through stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and performance awards, including cash awards. Prior to fiscal 2004, the Company had adopted various stock option plans (the Prior Plans), all of which solely provided for the granting of stock options. Upon adoption of the 2004 Plan, the common stock available under the Prior Plans became available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. No further option grants may be made under the Prior Plans, although outstanding awards under the Prior Plans will continue to be in effect.
Under the 2004 Plan and the Prior Plans, an aggregate of 83.4 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance. Under all plans, option grants are issued at market value on the date of grant and generally become exercisable in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant. Option grants for stock options issued prior to May 10, 2004 expire ten years after the date of grant. Since May 10, 2004, option 38 grants expire eight years after the date of grant. All option grants are non-qualified.
The Stock Option and Compensation committees determine the number of shares and the price per share for all awards granted under the plans. As of February26, 2005, no awards other than stock options had been granted by the Company. See Note 14, Revised Approach to Compensation, regarding awards granted subsequent to fiscal 2004.

REVISED APPROACH TO COMPENSATION On April20, 2005, the Compensation Committee made awards to executive officers and other executives reporting to the Companys Chief Executive Officer consisting of a combination of restricted stock and stock option grants. Consistent with past practice, the stock options granted to these executives will vest over time, subject, in general, to the executives remaining in the Companys employ on specified vesting dates. Vesting of the restricted stock awarded to these executives will be dependent on (i) the Companys achievement of a performance-based test for the fiscal year of grant, and (ii) assuming achievement of the performance-based test, time vesting, subject, in general, to the executive remaining in the Companys employ on specified vesting dates.
The Companys other employees who traditionally have received stock option grants have begun to receive awards consisting solely of restricted stock. Vesting of the restricted stock awarded to these employees will be based solely on time vesting with no performance test. The Company will record an expense related to the restricted stock program in fiscal 2005 in accordance with APB No. 25.
41 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February26, 2005 and February28, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February26, 2005. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February26, 2005 and February28, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended February26, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated May 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.
/s/   KPMG LLP New York, New York May 11, 2005 42 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.: We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February26, 2005 and February28, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February26, 2005, and our report dated May 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 9A . CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on their evaluation as of February26, 2005, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were sufficiently effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and instructions for Form 10-K.
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2005. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of February26, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, issued an audit report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended February26, 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
