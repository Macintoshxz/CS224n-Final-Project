Exhibits and   Financial Statement Schedules 2 Table of Contents PARTI Unless otherwise indicated, the term Company refers collectively to Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February26, 2011. The Companys fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest February28. Accordingly, fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 represented 52 weeks and ended on February26, 2011, February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to periods of time (e.g., quarters and years) are to fiscal periods.
ITEM 1 - BUSINESS Introduction Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath& Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS), Harmon and Harmon Face Values (Harmon) and buybuy BABY. In addition, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home& More. The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings include categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings, consumables and certain juvenile products. The Company believes that it is the nations largest operator of stores selling predominantly domestics merchandise and home furnishings while offering a breadth and depth of selection in most of its product categories that exceeds what is generally available in department stores or other specialty retail stores.
History The Company was founded in 1971 by Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg, the Co-Chairmen of the Company. Each has more than 50 years of experience in the retail industry.
The Company commenced operations in 1971 with the opening of two stores, which primarily sold bed linens and bath accessories. In 1985, the Company introduced its first store carrying a full line of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. The Company began using the name Bed Bath& Beyond in 1987 in order to reflect the expanded product line offered by its stores and to distinguish its stores from conventional specialty retail stores offering only domestics merchandise or home furnishings. In March2002, the Company acquired Harmon, a health and beauty care retailer, which operated 27 stores at the time located in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. In June2003, the Company acquired CTS, a retailer of giftware and household items, which operated 23 stores at the time located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island. In March2007, the Company acquired buybuy BABY, a retailer of infant and toddler merchandise, which operated 8 stores at the time located in Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia. In December2007, the Company opened its first international BBB store in Ontario, Canada. In May2008, the Company became a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home& More.
Operations It is the Companys goal to offer quality merchandise at everyday low prices; to maintain a wide assortment of merchandise; to present merchandise in a distinctive manner designed to maximize customer convenience and reinforce customer perception of wide selection; and to emphasize dedication to customer service and satisfaction.
Pricing.
The Company believes in maintaining everyday low prices. The Company regularly monitors price levels at its competitors in order to ensure that its prices are in accordance with its pricing philosophy. The Company believes that the application of its everyday low price philosophy is an important factor in establishing its reputation among customers.
3 Table of Contents Merchandise Assortment.
The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings include categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings, consumables and certain juvenile products. The Company encourages local store personnel to tailor the merchandise mix as appropriate to respond to changing trends and conditions. The factors taken into account in selecting the merchandise mix for a particular store include store size, configuration and local market conditions, such as climate and demographics. The Company, on an ongoing basis, tests new merchandise categories and adjusts the categories of merchandise carried in its stores and may add new departments or adjust the size of existing departments as required. Additionally, the Company continues to integrate the merchandise assortments within its concepts. The Company believes that the process of adding new departments, integrating the Companys merchandise within concepts, and expanding or reducing the size of various departments in response to changing conditions is an important part of its merchandising strategy.
Merchandise Presentation.
The Company has developed a distinctive style of merchandise presentation. Primarily all of the Companys stores have groups of related product lines presented together in separate areas of each store, creating the appearance that the store is comprised of several individual specialty stores for different product lines. The Company believes that this format of merchandise presentation makes it easy for customers to locate products, reinforces customer perception of wide selection and communicates to customers that its stores offer a level of customer service generally associated with smaller specialty stores.
The Company believes that its extensive merchandise selection, rather than fixturing, should be the focus of customer attention and, accordingly, primarily uses simple modular fixturing throughout its stores. This fixturing is primarily designed so that it can be easily reconfigured to adapt to changes in the stores merchandise mix and presentation. The Company believes that its merchandise displays create an exciting and attractive shopping environment that encourages impulse purchases of additional items.
Advertising.
In general, the Company relies on word of mouth advertising, its reputation for offering a wide assortment of quality merchandise at everyday low prices and the use of paid advertising. Primary vehicles of paid advertising used by the Company include full-color circulars and other advertising pieces distributed via direct mail or inserts, as well as email. Also, to support the opening of new stores, the Company primarily uses grand opening newspaper advertising and email.
Customer Service.
The Company places a strong focus on customer service and seeks to make shopping at its stores as pleasant and convenient as possible. Most stores are open seven days and six evenings a week in order to enable customers to shop at times that are convenient for them. In addition, the Companys websites, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, www.christmastreeshops.com, www.harmondiscount.com, www.facevalues.com and www.buybuybaby.com are available for customers to access 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Suppliers In fiscal 2010, the Company purchased its merchandise from approximately 5,500 suppliers with the Companys largest supplier accounting for approximately 5% of the Companys merchandise purchases and the Companys 10 largest suppliers accounting for approximately 20% of such purchases. The Company purchases substantially all of its merchandise in the United States, the majority from domestic sources and the balance from importers. The Company purchases a small amount of its merchandise directly from overseas sources.
The Company has no long term contracts for the purchase of merchandise. The Company believes that most merchandise, other than brand name goods, is available from a variety of sources and that most brand name goods can be replaced with comparable merchandise.
Warehousing The Companys merchandise displays allow a substantial amount of merchandise to be displayed on the sales floor at all times. Merchandise not displayed on the sales floor is typically stored in warehouse space within the store. In addition, the Company 4 Table of Contents maintains 11 supplemental storage locations as well as three central distribution centers. The majority of the Companys merchandise is directly shipped to stores from vendors through third party carriers and service providers; the remainder of the Companys merchandise is shipped to stores through its distribution centers.
In addition, the Company maintains two E-Service fulfillment centers.
Employees As of February26, 2011, the Company employed approximately 45,000 persons in full-time and part-time positions. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are very good and that the labor turnover rate among its management employees is lower than that generally experienced within the industry.
Seasonality The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in the calendar months of August, Novemberand December, and generally lower in February.
Expansion Program The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets, the expansion or relocation of existing stores and the continuous review of strategic acquisitions. In the 19 year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2010, the Company has grown from 34 stores to 1,139 stores. The Companys 1,139 stores operate in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, including: 982 BBB stores operating in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 66 CTS stores operating in 18 states; 46 Harmon stores operating in four states; and 45 buybuy BABY stores operating in 20 states. Total square footage grew from approximately 0.9 million square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to approximately 35.1 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2010, the Company opened a total of 40 new stores, including 18 BBB stores throughout the United States and Canada, five CTS stores, one Harmon store and 16 buybuy BABY stores, and closed one BBB store, all of which resulted in the aggregate addition of approximately 1.3 million square feet of store space. In addition, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home& More.
The Company intends to continue its expansion program and believes that the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, on the success of this program. As part of its expansion program, the Company expects to open new stores and expand existing stores as opportunities arise. The Company believes throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to open in excess of 1,300 BBB stores as well as grow the CTS and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast.
In determining where to open new stores, the Company evaluates a number of factors, including the availability of real estate, demographic information (such as data relating to income and education levels, age and occupation) and distribution. The Company has built its management structure with a view toward its expansion and believes that, as a result, it has the management depth necessary to support its anticipated expansion program.
Competition The Company believes it is the preeminent retailer in its segment of the home goods industry, which is fragmented and highly competitive. In addition, the Company competes with many different types of retail stores that sell many or most of the same products. Such competitors include but are not limited to: (i)department stores, which often carry many of the same product lines as the Companys stores but do not typically have the same depth or breadth of product selection, (ii)specialty stores, which often have a depth of product selection but typically carry only a limited portion of the product lines carried by the Companys stores, (iii)discount and mass merchandise stores, (iv)national chains and (v)internet online retailers. In addition, the Companys stores compete, to a more limited extent, with factory outlet stores that typically offer limited quantities or limited lines of quality merchandise at discount prices.
5 Table of Contents Other entities continue to introduce new concepts that include many of the product lines carried by the Companys stores. There can be no assurance that the operation of competitors will not have a material effect on the Company.
Tradenames and Service Marks The Company uses the Bed Bath& Beyond name and logo and the Beyond any store of its kind tag line as service marks in connection with retail services. The Company has registered these marks and others, including names and logos of CTS, Harmon and buybuy BABY, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company also has registered or has applications pending with the trademark registries of several foreign countries, including having registered the Bed Bath& Beyond name and logo and the Beyond any store of its kind tag line in Canada. Management believes that its name recognition and service marks are important elements of the Companys merchandising strategy.
Available Information The Company makes available as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), free of charge, through its website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, the Companys annual reports on Form10-K, quarterly reports on Form10-Q, current reports on Form8-K, and amendments to those reports, electronically filed or furnished pursuant to Section13(a)or 15(d)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors that may be outside the Companys control. Such factors include the following: General Economic Conditions General economic factors that are beyond the Companys control impact the Companys forecasts and actual performance. These factors include housing markets, recession, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, fuel and energy costs, interest rates, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, conditions affecting the retail environment for the home and other matters that influence consumer spending. Changes in the economic climate could adversely affect the Companys performance.
Competition and Pricing Pressures The retail business is highly competitive. The Company competes for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of the business with many other local, regional and national retailers. Those competitors range from specialty retail stores to department stores, discounters and internet online retailers. Unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of those competitors, including promotional activity, may adversely affect the Companys performance.
Consumer Preferences and Demographic Factors The Companys success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing merchandise trends, customer demands and demographics. The Companys failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in customer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could lead to, among other things, excess inventories or a shortage of products and could have a material adverse affect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.
6 Table of Contents Unusual Weather Patterns The Companys operating results could be negatively impacted by unusual weather patterns. Frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms, hurricanes, floods, tornados or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect the Companys performance.
Information Technology Systems The Companys operating results could be negatively impacted by a major disruption of the Companys information technology systems. The Company relies heavily on these systems to process transactions, manage inventory replenishment, summarize results and control distribution of products. Despite numerous safeguards and careful contingency planning, the system is still subject to power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, security breaches and other catastrophic events. A major disruption of the system and its backup mechanisms may cause the Company to incur significant costs to repair the system, experience a critical loss of data and result in business interruptions.
Consumer and Employee Information Privacy The Company stores certain information about its customers and employees in the ordinary course of business. The Company invests considerable resources in protecting this sensitive information but is still subject to a possible security event. A breach of our security systems resulting in unauthorized access to stored personal information could negatively impact the Companys operating results and financial performance. Certain aspects of the business, particularly the Company website, heavily depend on consumers entrusting personal financial information to be transmitted securely over public networks. A loss of consumer confidence could result in lost future sales and have a material adverse effect on the Companys reputation. In addition, a privacy breach could cause the Company to incur significant costs to restore the integrity of its system, and could result in significant costs in government penalties and private litigation.
Statutory, Regulatory and Other Legal Developments The Company is subject to numerous statutory, regulatory and legal requirements at a local, state and national level. The Companys operating results could be negatively impacted by developments in these areas due to the costs of compliance in addition to possible government penalties and litigation in the event of deemed noncompliance. Changes in the regulatory environment in the area of product safety, environmental protection, privacy and information security, wage and hour laws, among others, could potentially impact the Companys operations and financial results.
Accounting and Tax Rulesand Regulations The Companys operating results and financial position could be negatively impacted by changes to accounting rulesand regulations or new interpretations of existing accounting standards. These changes may include, without limitation, changes to lease accounting standards. The Companys effective income tax rate could be impacted by changes in accounting standards as well as changes in tax laws or the interpretations of these tax laws by courts and taxing authorities which could negatively impact the Companys financial results.
Cost of Labor, Merchandise and Other Expenses The Companys success depends, in part, on its ability to manage operating costs and to look for opportunities to reduce costs. The Companys ability to meet its labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. The Companys ability to find qualified vendors and obtain access to products in a timely and efficient manner can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, transportation costs and other factors beyond the Companys control.
7 Table of Contents Expansion Program The Companys growth depends, in part, on its ability to open new stores and operate profitably. The Companys ability to open additional stores successfully will depend on a number of factors, including its identification and availability of suitable store locations; its success in negotiating leases on acceptable terms; its hiring and training of skilled store operating personnel, especially management; and its timely development of new stores, including the availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction and other delays in store openings based on weather or other events. This increases the cost of doing business and the risk that the Companys business practices could result in liabilities that may adversely affect its performance, despite the exercise of reasonable care.
Auction Rate Securities As of February26, 2011, the Company held approximately $109.7 million of net investments in auction rate securities. These securities are invested in preferred shares of closed end municipal bond funds, which are required, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, to maintain minimum asset coverage ratios of 200%. None of the auction rate securities held by the Company are mortgage-backed debt obligations. Beginning in mid-February2008, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities failed and continues to fail. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. All of these investments carry triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies and the Company believes that given their high credit quality, it will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
These securities of approximately $112.9 million at par had a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.2 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed to be temporary it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Companys net earnings for fiscal 2010. The Company does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in these auction rate securities, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program, share repurchase program and planned capital expenditures. However, if the interest rate environment changes, the Company may incur further temporary impairment losses. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue and these markets deteriorate further, the Company may conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary and incur realized losses, including up to the full amount of the investments in auction rate securities, which could negatively affect the Companys financial position, cash flow and results of operations. During fiscal 2010 and 2009, approximately $25.0 million and $38.5 million, respectively, of these auction rate securities, were redeemed at par. As of February26, 2011, the Company classified approximately $5.8 million of these securities as short term investment securities due to expected redemptions at par during fiscal 2011. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2010 through April15, 2011, the Company additionally redeemed approximately $5.8 million of these securities at par. The classification and valuation of these securities will continue to be reviewed quarterly.

8 Table of Contents The Companys 1,139 stores are located in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada and range in size from approximately 5,000 to 100,000 square feet, but are predominantly between 20,000 and 50,000 square feet.

The leases provide for original lease terms that generally range from 10 to 15 years and most leases provide for renewal options, often at increased rents. The Company evaluates leases on an ongoing basis which may lead to renegotiated lease terms, including rents during renewal options, or the possible relocation of stores. Certain leases provide for scheduled rent increases (which, in the case of fixed increases, the Company accounts for on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term, beginning when the Company obtains possession of the premises) and/or for contingent rent (based upon store sales exceeding stipulated amounts).
In addition, the Company leases storage space in 13 locations, totaling approximately 1.6 million square feet, that provide supplemental merchandise storage space and fulfillment of BBBs E-Service activities. This space is used to supplement the warehouse facilities in the Companys stores in proximity to these locations. In addition, the Company also owns two distribution centers totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet.

14 Table of Contents ITEM 7- MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath& Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS), Harmon and Harmon Face Values (Harmon) and buybuy BABY. In addition, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home& More. The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings include categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings, consumables and certain juvenile products. The Companys objective is to be a customers first choice for products and services in the categories offered, in the markets in which the Company operates.
The Companys strategy is to achieve this objective through excellent customer service, an extensive breadth and depth of assortment, everyday low prices and introduction of new merchandising offerings, supported by the continuous development and improvement of its infrastructure.
Operating in the highly competitive retail industry, the Company, along with other retail companies, is influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions including the housing market, the overall macroeconomic environment and related changes in the retailing environment, consumer preferences and spending habits, unusual weather patterns, competition from existing and potential competitors, and the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program.
While it appears that the economic environment has stabilized, a number of challenges, including higher commodity prices, and relatively high unemployment could continue to pressure consumers and affect their spending. The Company cannot predict whether, when or the manner in which these economic conditions will change.
The Company remains committed to making the required investments in its infrastructure to help position the Company for continued success. The Company continues to review and prioritize its capital needs while continuing to make investments, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements including increased spending on its interactive platforms, and other projects whose impact is considered important to its future.
The following represents an overview of the Companys financial performance for the periods indicated:  Net sales in fiscal 2010 increased approximately 11.9% to $8.759 billion; net sales in fiscal 2009 increased approximately 8.6% to $7.829 billion over net sales of $7.208 billion in fiscal 2008.
Comparable store sales for fiscal 2010 increased by approximately 7.8% as compared with a increase of approximately 4.4% in fiscal 2009 and a decrease of approximately 2.4% in fiscal 2008.
A store is considered a comparable store when it has been open for twelve full months following its grand opening period (typically four to six weeks). Stores relocated or expanded are excluded from comparable store sales if the change in square footage would cause meaningful disparity in sales over the prior period. In the case of a store to be closed, such stores sales are not considered comparable once the store closing process has commenced.
Gross profit for fiscal 2010 was $3.623 billion or 41.4% of net sales compared with $3.208 billion or 41.0% of net sales for fiscal 2009 and $2.873 billion or 39.9% of net sales for fiscal 2008.
15 Table of Contents  Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for fiscal 2010 were $2.334 billion or 26.7% of net sales compared with $2.227 billion or 28.5% of net sales for fiscal 2009 and $2.199 billion or 30.5% of net sales for fiscal 2008.
The effective tax rate was 38.8%, 39.1% and 37.8% for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
For the fiscal year ended February26, 2011, net earnings per diluted share were $3.07 ($791.3 million), an increase of approximately 33%, as compared with net earnings per diluted share of $2.30 ($600.0 million) for fiscal 2009, which was an increase of approximately 40% from net earnings per diluted share of $1.64 ($425.1 million) for fiscal 2008. The increase in net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal years ended February26, 2011 and February27, 2010 primarily reflect the favorable movements in gross profit and SG&A expenses.
During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Companys capital expenditures were $183.5 million, $153.7 million and $215.9 million, respectively. In addition, during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company repurchased 15.9 million, 2.7 million and 1.7 million shares, respectively, of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $687.6 million, $94.9 million and $48.1 million, respectively.
The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long term objectives. In fiscal 2011, the Company expects to open approximately 45 new stores across all concepts. During fiscal 2010, the Company opened a total of 40 new stores, including 18 BBB stores throughout the United States and Canada, five CTS stores, one Harmon store and 16 buybuy BABY stores, and closed one BBB store.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated (i)selected statement of earnings data of the Company expressed as a percentage of net sales and (ii)the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of earnings data: FiscalYearEnded Percentage PercentageChange ofNetSales fromPriorYear February26, February27, February28, February26, February27, 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 11.9 % 8.6 % Cost of sales 58.6 59.0 60.1 11.1 6.6 Gross profit 41.4 41.0 39.9 12.9 11.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 26.7 28.5 30.5 4.8 1.3 Operating profit 14.7 12.5 9.3 31.4 45.5 Earnings before provision for income taxes 14.8 12.6 9.5 31.2 44.2 Net earnings 9.0 7.7 5.9 31.9 41.1 16 Table of Contents Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2010 increased $929.7 million to $8.759 billion, representing an increase of 11.9% over $7.829 billion of net sales in fiscal 2009, which increased $620.5 million or 8.6% over the $7.208 billion of net sales in fiscal 2008. For fiscal 2010, approximately 65.2% of the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in the Companys comparable store sales and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales. For fiscal 2009, approximately 51.4% of the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the Companys comparable store sales.
For fiscal 2010, comparable store sales for 1,013 stores represented $8.339 billion of net sales; for fiscal 2009, comparable store sales for 942 stores represented $7.409 billion of net sales; and for fiscal 2008, comparable store sales for 874 stores represented $6.746 billion of net sales. Comparable store sales increased by approximately 7.8% for fiscal 2010 and increased by approximately 4.4% for fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 and 2009 net sales and comparable store sales reflected consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings.
Sales of domestics merchandise accounted for approximately 41%, 41% and 43% of net sales in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of which the Company estimates that bed linens accounted for approximately 12%, 13% and 13% of net sales in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The remaining net sales in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 of 59%, 59% and 57%, respectively, represented sales of home furnishings. No other individual product category accounted for 10% or more of net sales during fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008.
Gross Profit Gross profit in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $3.623 billion or 41.4 % of net sales, $3.208 billion or 41.0% of net sales and $2.873 billion or 39.9% of net sales, respectively. The increase in gross profit between fiscal 2010 and 2009 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a decrease in coupon expense as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. The increase in gross profit between fiscal 2009 and 2008 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to decreases in inventory acquisition costs, coupon expense and markdowns, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Selling, General and Administrative expenses SG&A was $2.334 billion or 26.7 % of net sales in fiscal 2010, $2.227 billion or 28.5% of net sales in fiscal 2009 and $2.199 billion or 30.5% of net sales in fiscal 2008. The decrease in SG&A between fiscal 2010 and 2009 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to relative decreases in payroll and occupancy expenses, as well as a relative decrease in advertising expenses resulting from a reduction in the distribution of advertising pieces. Payroll and occupancy (including rent and depreciation) expense benefited from the approximate 7.8% increase in comparable store sales. The decrease in SG&A between fiscal 2009 and 2008 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a relative decrease in advertising expenses resulting from a decrease in the distribution of advertising pieces. Also contributing to the decrease were relative decreases in payroll expenses and occupancy costs (including rent, utilities and depreciation).
Operating Profit Operating profit for fiscal 2010 was $1.288 billion or 14.7% of net sales, $980.7 million or 12.5% of net sales in fiscal 2009 and $673.9 million or 9.3% of net sales in fiscal 2008. The changes in operating profit as a percentage of net sales were a result of the changes in the gross profit margin and SG&A as a percentage of net sales as described above.
17 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income was $4.5 million, $4.6 million and $9.4 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest income decreased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of lower interest rates partially offset by an increase in the fair value of the trading investment securities related to the Companys nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 38.8% for fiscal 2010, 39.1% for fiscal 2009 and 37.8% for fiscal 2008. For fiscal 2010, the tax rate included an approximate $0.9 million provision primarily due to the recognition of certain discrete tax items, partially offset by the changing of the blended state tax rate of deferred income taxes. For fiscal 2009, the tax rate included an approximate $3.2 million provision primarily due to the recognition of certain discrete tax items partially offset by the changing of the blended state tax rate of deferred income taxes. The remaining increase in the 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to slightly higher state taxes.
The Company expects continued volatility in the effective tax rate from year to year because the Company is required each year to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit.
EXPANSION PROGRAM The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets, the expansion or relocation of existing stores and the continuous review of strategic acquisitions. In the 19-year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2010, the chain has grown from 34 to 1,139 stores. Total square footage grew from 0.9 million square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to 35.1 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2010, the Company opened a total of 40 new stores, including 18 BBB stores throughout the United States and Canada, five CTS stores, one Harmon store and 16 buybuy BABY stores, and closed one BBB store, all of which resulted in the aggregate addition of approximately 1.3 million square feet of store space. In May2008, the Company became a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home& More.
The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long term objectives. In fiscal 2011, the Company expects to open approximately 45 new stores across all concepts.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company has no outstanding bank borrowings and has been able to finance its operations, including its expansion program, entirely through internally generated funds. For fiscal 2011, the Company believes that it will continue to finance its operations, including its expansion program, share repurchase program and planned capital expenditures, entirely through existing and internally generated funds. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2011, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, and information technology enhancements including increased spending on interactive platforms, and other projects, are planned to be approximately $250.0 million.
Fiscal 2010 compared to Fiscal 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was $987.4 million, compared with $905.4 million in fiscal 2009. Year-over-year, the Company experienced an increase in net earnings, partially offset by an increase in cash used for the net components of working capital (primarily merchandise inventories and income taxes payable, partially offset by deferred rent and other liabilities).
Inventory per square foot was $56.17 as of February26, 2011, as compared to $52.15 as of February27, 2010. This increase of approximately 7.7% was primarily due to increased inventory levels required to support recent increases in comparable store sales and the timing of merchandise receipts.
18 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2010 was $341.0 million, compared with $488.7 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, net cash used in investing activities was due to $157.5 million of purchases of investment securities, net of redemptions, and $183.5 million of capital expenditures. In fiscal 2009, net cash used in investing activities was due to $335.0 million of purchases of investment securities, net of redemptions, and $153.7 million of capital expenditures.
Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2010 was $559.0 million, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $11.2 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in net cash used was primarily due to a $592.7 million increase in common stock repurchases partially offset by a $26.0 million increase in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
Fiscal 2009 compared to Fiscal 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2009 was $905.4 million, compared with $584.0 million in fiscal 2008. Year-over-year, the Company experienced a decrease in cash used for the net components of working capital (primarily accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and income taxes payable, partially offset by merchandise inventories), and an increase in net earnings.
Inventory per square foot was $52.15 as of February27, 2010, an increase of approximately 1.8% from $51.24 as of February28, 2009. The Company continues to focus on optimizing inventory productivity while maintaining appropriate in-store merchandise levels to support sales.
Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2009 was $488.7 million, compared with $113.1 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, net cash used in investing activities was due to $335.0 million of purchases of investment securities, net of redemptions, and $153.7 million of capital expenditures. In fiscal 2008, net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $215.9 million of capital expenditures partially offset by $107.6 million of redemptions of investment securities.
Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2009 was $11.2 million, compared with net cash used in financing activities of $26.8 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in net cash provided was primarily due to an $82.1 million increase in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by a $46.8 million increase in common stock repurchases.
Auction Rate Securities As of February26, 2011, the Company held approximately $109.7 million of net investments in auction rate securities. Beginning in mid-February2008, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities failed and continues to fail. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. All of these investments carry triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies and the Company believes that given their high credit quality, it will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities. As of February26, 2011, these securities had a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.2 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed to be temporary, it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Companys net earnings for fiscal 2010. As of February26, 2011, the Company classified approximately $5.8 million of these securities as short term investment securities due to expected redemptions at par during fiscal 2011.
During fiscal 2010, approximately $67.8 million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par, of which approximately $42.8 million were repurchased per an agreement with the investment firm that sold the Company a portion of its auction rate securities. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2010 through April15, 2011, the Company additionally redeemed approximately $5.8 million at par.
19 Table of Contents The Company does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in its auction rate securities, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program, share repurchase program, and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments. These investments will remain primarily classified as non-current assets until the Company has better visibility as to when their liquidity will be restored. The classification and valuation of these securities will continue to be reviewed quarterly.
Other Fiscal 2010 Information At February26, 2011, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million each, with expiration dates of February29, 2012 and September2, 2011, respectively. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently and are expected to be used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. During fiscal 2010, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of February26, 2011, there was approximately $7.9 million of outstanding letters of credit. Although no assurances can be provided, the Company intends to renew both uncommitted lines of credit before the respective expiration dates. In addition, as of February26, 2011, the Company maintained unsecured standby letters of credit of $64.5 million, primarily for certain insurance programs.
In December2010, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program. The Company is planning that the new share repurchase program will commence after completion of the existing share repurchase program. The Company anticipates that this new program will be funded from current cash and from present and expected future cash flows. Between December2004 and December2010, the Companys Board of Directors has authorized, through several share repurchase programs, the repurchase of $4.950 billion of its shares of common stock.
Since 2004 through the end of fiscal 2010, the Company has repurchased approximately $2.8 billion of its common stock through several share repurchase programs. The Company has approximately $2.1 billion remaining of authorized share repurchases as of February26, 2011. The execution of the Companys share repurchase program will consider current business and market conditions.
The Company has authorization to make repurchases from time to time in the open market or through other parameters approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to existing rulesand regulations.
The Company has contractual obligations consisting mainly of operating leases for stores, offices, warehouse facilities and equipment, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities which the Company is obligated to pay as of February26, 2011 as follows: 20 Table of Contents (inthousands) Total Lessthan1 year 1-3years 4-5years After5 years Operating Lease Obligations (1) $ 3,103,586 $ 457,676 $ 819,952 $ 639,596 $ 1,186,362 Purchase Obligations (2) 749,575 749,575    Other long-term liabilities (3) 392,094     Total Contractual Obligations $ 4,245,255 $ 1,207,251 $ 819,952 $ 639,596 $ 1,186,362 (1)   The amounts presented represent the future minimum lease payments under   non-cancelable operating leases. In addition to minimum rent, certain of the   Companys leases require the payment of additional costs for insurance, maintenance   and other costs. These additional amounts are not included in the table of   contractual commitments as the timing and/or amounts of such payments are not   known. As of February26, 2011, the Company has leased sites for 27 new   stores planned for opening in fiscal 2011 or 2012, for which aggregate   minimum rental payments over the term of the leases are approximately $100.1   million and are included in the table above.
(2)   Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise.
(3)   Amounts recorded as deferred rent and other liabilities and income taxes   payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February26, 2011 have   been reflected only in the Total column in the table above as the timing   and/or amount of any cash payment is uncertain. Deferred rent and other   liabilities are primarily comprised of deferred rent, workers compensation   and general liability reserves and various other accruals.
SEASONALITY The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in the calendar months of August, Novemberand December, and generally lower in February.
INFLATION The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, accruals for self insurance, litigation, store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, stock-based compensation and income and certain other taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Inventory Valuation : Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB, buybuy BABY and Harmon are calculated using the weighted average retail inventory method and inventory costs for CTS are calculated using the first in first out cost method.
Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail values of inventories. The cost associated with determining the cost-to-retail ratio includes: merchandise purchases, net of returns to vendors, discounts and volume and incentive rebates; inbound freight expenses; duty, insurance and commissions.
21 Table of Contents At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions.
The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory counts for locations at which counts were conducted. For locations where physical inventory counts were not conducted in the fiscal year, an estimated shrink reserve is recorded based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile.
The Company accrues for merchandise in transit once it takes legal ownership and title to the merchandise; as such, an estimate for merchandise in transit is included in the Companys merchandise inventories.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. The Company has not historically recorded any material impairment to its long-lived assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that a long-lived asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these long-lived assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets : The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets. The Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets and determined that, as of February26, 2011, no impairment existed because the fair value of these assets substantially exceeded their carrying values. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs .
Self Insurance : The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
Litigation : The Company records an estimated liability related to its various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business when and to the extent that it concludes a liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such estimated loss is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to claims and legal actions and revises its estimated liabilities, as appropriate. The Company expects the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Company also cannot predict the nature and validity 22 Table of Contents of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings.
Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs : Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation: The Company uses a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options. The Black-Scholes model includes various assumptions, including the expected life of stock options, the expected risk free interest rate and the expected volatility. These assumptions reflect the Companys best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of the Company. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, total stock-based compensation cost could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if the Company uses different assumptions for future grants, stock-based compensation cost could be materially impacted in future periods.
The Company determines its assumptions for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in accordance with the accounting guidance related to stock compensation.
The expected life of stock options is estimated based on historical experience.
The expected risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options.
Expected volatility is based on the average of historical and implied volatility. The historical volatility is determined by observing actual prices of the Companys stock over a period commensurate with the expected life of the awards. The implied volatility represents the implied volatility of the Companys call options, which are actively traded on multiple exchanges, had remaining maturities in excess of twelve months, had market prices close to the exercise prices of the employee stock options and were measured on the stock option grant date.
The Company is required to record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. The Companys forfeiture rate assumption used in determining its stock-based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data. The actual forfeiture rate could differ from these estimates.
Taxes : The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of its Canadian subsidiary. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., in most cases such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.
The Company expects continued volatility in the effective tax rate from year to year because the Company is required each year to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit.
23 Table of Contents The Company also accrues for certain other taxes as required by their operations.
Judgment is required in determining the provision for income and other taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys various tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form10-K and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors that may be outside the Companys control. Such factors include, without limitation: general economic conditions including the housing market, a challenging overall macroeconomic environment and related changes in the retailing environment, consumer preferences and spending habits; demographics and other macroeconomic factors that may impact the level of spending for the types of merchandise sold by the Company; unusual weather patterns; competition from existing and potential competitors; competition from other channels of distribution; pricing pressures; the cost of labor, merchandise and other costs and expenses; the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program; the impact of failed auctions for auction rate securities held by the Company; disruptions to the Companys information technology systems including but not limited to security breaches of the Companys systems protecting consumer and employee information; changes to statutory, regulatory and legal requirements; changes to, or new, tax laws or interpretation of existing tax laws; and changes to, or new, accounting standards including, without limitation, changes to lease accounting standards. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update its forward-looking statements.
ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of February26, 2011, the Companys investments include cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.184 billion, short term investment securities of approximately $605.6 million and long term investment securities of approximately $121.4 million at weighted average interest rates of 0.04%, 0.15% and 0.39%, respectively.
As of February26, 2011, the Company held approximately $109.7 million of net investments in auction rate securities. Beginning in mid-February2008, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities failed and continues to fail. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. All of these investments carry triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies and the Company believes that given their high credit quality, it will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities. As of February26, 2011, these securities had a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.2 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed to be temporary, it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Companys net earnings for fiscal 2010. As of February26, 2011, the Company classified approximately $5.8 million of these securities as short term investment securities due to expected redemptions at par during fiscal 2011.
During fiscal 2010, approximately $67.8 million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par, of which approximately $42.8 million were repurchased per an agreement with the investment firm that sold the Company a portion of its auction rate securities. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2010 through April15, 2011, the Company additionally redeemed approximately $5.8 million at par.
The Company does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in its auction rate securities, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments. These investments will remain primarily classified as non-current assets until the Company has better visibility as to when their liquidity will be restored. The classification and valuation of these securities will continue to be reviewed quarterly.

29 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and Subsidiaries 1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED MATTERS A.
Nature of Operations Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath& Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS), Harmon and Harmon Face Values (Harmon) and buybuy BABY. In addition, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home& More. The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings include categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings, consumables and certain juvenile products. As the Company operates in the retail industry, its results of operations are affected by general economic conditions and consumer spending habits.
B.
Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest February28. Accordingly, fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 represented 52 weeks and ended on February26, 2011, February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, respectively.
C.
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
D.
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of auction rate securities, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, accruals for self insurance, litigation, store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, the provision for sales returns, vendor allowances, stock-based compensation and income and certain other taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
E.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Included in cash and cash equivalents are credit and debit card receivables from banks, which typically settle within 5 business days, of $61.9 million and $56.0 million as of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, respectively.
F.
Investment Securities Investment securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury Bills with remaining maturities of less than one year and auction rate 30 Table of Contents securities, which are securities with interest rates that reset periodically through an auction process. The U.S. Treasury Bills are classified as short term held-to-maturity securities and are stated at their amortized cost which approximates fair value. Auction rate securities are classified as available-for-sale or trading and are stated at fair value, which had historically been consistent with cost or par value due to interest rates which reset periodically, typically every 7, 28 or 35 days. As a result, there generally were no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains or losses relating to these auction rate securities. However, beginning in mid-February2008 due to market conditions, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities failed and continues to fail. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities, and affect their estimated fair values at February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. (See Fair Value Measurements, Note 4 and Investment Securities, Note 5). All income from these investments is recorded as interest income.
Those investment securities which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments and are stated at amortized cost. Those investment securities which are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are stated at fair market value.
Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted over the life of the security as adjustments to interest income using the effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
G.
Inventory Valuation Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB, buybuy BABY and Harmon are calculated using the weighted average retail inventory method and inventory costs for CTS are calculated using the first in first out cost method.
Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail values of inventories. The cost associated with determining the cost-to-retail ratio includes: merchandise purchases, net of returns to vendors, discounts and volume and incentive rebates; inbound freight expenses; duty, insurance and commissions.
At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions.
The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory counts for locations at which counts were conducted. For locations where physical inventory counts were not conducted in the fiscal year, an estimated shrink reserve is recorded based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile.
The Company accrues for merchandise in transit once it takes legal ownership and title to the merchandise; as such, an estimate for merchandise in transit is included in the Companys merchandise inventories.
H.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (forty years for buildings; five to twenty years for furniture, fixtures and equipment; and three to seven years for computer equipment and software). Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful life or the life of the lease. Depreciation expense is primarily included within selling, general and administrative expenses.
31 Table of Contents The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to earnings as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs amounted to $90.2 million, $86.2 million and $81.1 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
I.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. The Company has not historically recorded any material impairment to its long-lived assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that a long-lived asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these long-lived assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
J.
Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available, including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets. The Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets and determined that, as of February26, 2011, no impairment existed because the fair value of these assets substantially exceeded their carrying values. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Included within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, respectively, is $198.7 million for goodwill and $30.9 million for indefinite lived tradenames.
K.
Self Insurance The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
L.
Deferred Rent The Company accounts for scheduled rent increases contained in its leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease beginning as of the date the Company obtained possession of the leased premises. Deferred rent amounted to $78.3 million and $78.7 million as of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, respectively.
Cash or lease incentives (tenant allowances) received pursuant to certain store leases are recognized on a straight-line basis as a 32 Table of Contents reduction to rent over the lease term. The unamortized portion of tenant allowances is included in deferred rent and other liabilities.

N.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, accounts payable and certain other liabilities. The Companys investment securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, which are stated at amortized cost, and auction rate securities, which are stated at their approximate fair value. The book value of all financial instruments is representative of their fair values (See Fair Value Measurements, Note 4).
O.
Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at the Companys retail stores or upon delivery for products purchased from its websites. The value of point-of-sale coupons and point-of-sale rebates that result in a reduction of the price paid by the customer are recorded as a reduction of sales. Shipping and handling fees that are billed to a customer in a sale transaction are recorded in sales. Taxes, such as sales tax, use tax and value added tax, are not included in sales.
Revenues from gift cards, gift certificates and merchandise credits are recognized when redeemed. Gift cards have no provisions for reduction in the value of unused card balances over defined time periods and have no expiration dates, but are subject to state escheat regulations; as such, the Company does not record income associated with unredeemed gift cards.
Sales returns are provided for in the period that the related sales are recorded based on historical experience. Although the estimate for sales returns has not varied materially from historical provisions, actual experience could vary from historical experience in the future if the level of sales return activity changes materially. In the future, if the Company concludes that an adjustment to the sales return accrual is required due to material changes in the returns activity, the reserve will be adjusted accordingly.
P.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise, buying costs and costs of the Companys distribution network including inbound freight charges, distribution facility costs, receiving costs, internal transfer costs and shipping and handling costs.
33 Table of Contents Q.
Vendor Allowances The Company receives allowances from vendors in the normal course of business for various reasons including direct cooperative advertising, purchase volume and reimbursement for other expenses. Annual terms for each allowance include the basis for earning the allowance and payment terms, which vary by agreement. All vendor allowances are recorded as a reduction of inventory cost, except for direct cooperative advertising allowances which are specific, incremental and identifiable. The Company recognizes purchase volume allowances as a reduction of the cost of inventory in the quarter in which milestones are achieved. Advertising costs were reduced by direct cooperative allowances of $17.6 million, $14.5 million and $14.9 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
R.
Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred.
S.
Advertising Costs Expenses associated with direct response advertising are expensed over the period during which the sales are expected to occur, generally four to six weeks, and all other expenses associated with store advertising are charged to earnings as incurred. Net advertising costs amounted to $198.3 million, $230.6 million and $266.4 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
T.
Stock-Based Compensation The Company measures all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and records such expense in its consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted the accounting guidance related to stock compensation on August28, 2005 (the date of adoption) under the modified prospective application. Under this application, the Company records stock-based compensation expense for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption and for the portion of previously granted awards that remained unvested at the date of adoption. Currently, the Companys stock-based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards.
U. Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return. Income tax returns are also filed with each taxable jurisdiction in which the Company conducts business.
The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of its Canadian subsidiary. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., in most cases such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood 34 Table of Contents of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.
Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
V. Earnings per Share The Company presents earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis. Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding including the dilutive effect of stock-based awards as calculated under the treasury stock method.
Stock-based awards of approximately 1.5 million, 9.8 million and 15.3 million shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
W.
Segments The Company accounts for its operations as one operating segment.

These uncommitted lines of credit are currently and are expected to be used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. During fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of February26, 2011, there was approximately $7.9 million of outstanding letters of credit. Although no assurances can be provided, the Company intends to renew both uncommitted lines of credit before the respective expiration dates. In addition, as of February26, 2011, the Company maintained unsecured standby letters of credit of $64.5 million, primarily for certain insurance programs. As of February27, 2010, there was approximately $6.1 million of outstanding letters of credit and approximately $55.0 million of outstanding unsecured standby letters of credit, primarily for certain insurance programs.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches, including quoted market prices and discounted cash flows. The hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect a companys judgment concerning the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available under the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:  Level 1  Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the Company is able to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
Level 2  Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar, or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
Level 3  Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
As of February26, 2011, the Companys financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputs include long term investment securities traded on active securities exchanges. The Company did not have any financial assets utilizing Level 2 inputs. Financial assets utilizing Level 3 inputs included short term and long term investments in auction rate securities consisting of preferred shares of closed end municipal bond funds (See Investment Securities, Note 5).
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the Companys degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset or liability must be classified in its entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value.
Valuation techniques used by the Company must be consistent with at least one of the three possible approaches: the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach. The Companys Level 1 valuations are based on the market approach and consist primarily of quoted prices for identical items on active securities exchanges. The Companys Level 3 valuations of auction rate securities are based on the income approach, specifically, discounted cash flow analyses which utilize significant inputs based on the Companys estimates and assumptions. Inputs include current coupon rates and expected maturity dates.
The following table presents the valuation of the Companys financial assets as of February26, 2011 measured at fair value on a recurring basis by input level: 36 Table of Contents QuotedPrices inActive Marketsfor Identical Assets Significant Unobservable Inputs (inmillions) (Level1) (Level3) Total Short term - available-for-sale securities: Auction rate securities  5.8 5.8 Long term - available-for-sale securities: Auction rate securities  103.9 103.9 Long term - trading securities: Nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets 17.6  17.6 Total $ 17.6 $ 109.7 $ 127.3 The following table presents the changes in the Companys financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): (inmillions) AuctionRate Securities PutOption TotalSignificant Unobservable Inputs(Level3) Balance on February27, 2010, net of   temporary valuation adjustment $ 176.3 $ 2.3 $ 178.6 Change in temporary valuation adjustment included   in accumulated other comprehensive income (1.1 )  (1.1 ) Unrealized gain included in earnings (1) 2.3  2.3 Change in valuation of Put Option  (2.3 ) (2.3 ) Redemptions at par (67.8 )  (67.8 ) Balance on February26, 2011, net of   temporary valuation adjustment $ 109.7 $  $ 109.7 (1)None of the gains for the period included in earnings relate to assets still held on February26, 2011.
Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2010 through April15, 2011, the Company additionally redeemed approximately $5.8 million of short term available-for-sale securities at par.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES The Companys investment securities as of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010 are as follows: (inmillions) February26, 2011 February27, 2010 Available-for-sale securities: Short term $ 5.8 $ 15.0 Long term 103.9 120.8 Trading securities: Short term  40.5 Long term 17.6 12.1 Held-to-maturity securities: Short term 599.8 373.6 Put option: Short term  2.3 Total investment securities $ 727.1 $ 564.3 37 Table of Contents Auction Rate Securities As of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, the Companys available-for-sale investment securities represented approximately $112.9 million and approximately $137.9 million par value of auction rate securities, respectively, less temporary valuation adjustments of approximately $3.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Since these valuation adjustments are deemed to be temporary, they are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Companys earnings. These securities at par are invested in preferred shares of closed end municipal bond funds, which are required, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, to maintain minimum asset coverage ratios of 200%. All of these available-for-sale investments carried triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies as of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, and none of them are mortgage-backed debt obligations. As of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, the Companys available-for-sale investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more, however, the Company believes that the unrealized losses are temporary and reflect the investments current lack of liquidity. Due to their lack of liquidity, the Company classified approximately $103.9 million and $120.8 million of these investments as long term investment securities at February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, respectively. During fiscal 2010, approximately $25.0 million of these securities were redeemed at par. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2010 through April15, 2011, the Company additionally redeemed approximately $5.8 million of short term available-for-sale securities at par.
As of February27, 2010, the Companys trading investment securities included approximately $40.5 million at fair value ($42.8 million at par) of additional auction rate securities which were invested in securities collateralized by student loans. During the first six months of fiscal 2010, pursuant to an agreement with the investment firm that sold the Company these securities, the remaining $42.8 million of these securities were redeemed at par.
U.S. Treasury Securities As of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, the Companys short term held-to-maturity securities included approximately $599.8 million and approximately $373.6 million, respectively, of U.S. Treasury Bills with remaining maturities of less than one year. These securities are stated at their amortized cost which approximates fair value.
Long Term Trading Investment Securities The Companys long term trading investment securities, which are provided as investment options to the participants of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, are stated at fair market value. The values of these trading investment securities included in the table above are approximately $17.6 million and $12.1 million as of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, respectively.
38 Table of Contents 6.

At February 27, 2010, the Company has recorded approximately $9.7 million and $103.4 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits in current and non-current taxes payable, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet of which approximately $107.8 million would impact the Companys effective tax rate. As of February 26, 2011 and February 27, 2010, the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits included approximately $30.2 million and $21.6 million, respectively, of accrued interest. The Company recorded an increase of interest of approximately $9.2 million and $6.1 million for the years ended February 26, 2011 and February 27, 2010, respectively, for gross unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated statement of earnings.
The Company anticipates that any adjustments to gross unrecognized tax benefits which will impact income tax expense, due to the settlement of audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations, could be approximately $5.0 to $10.0 million in the next twelve months. However, actual results could differ from those currently anticipated.
As of February 26, 2011, the Company operated in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada and files income tax returns in the United States and various state, local and international jurisdictions.

TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES WITH RELATED PARTIES A.
In fiscal 2002, the Company had an interest in certain life insurance policies on the lives of its Co-Chairmen and their spouses. The Companys interest in these policies was equivalent to the net premiums paid by the Company. The agreements relating to the Companys interest in the life insurance policies on the lives of its Co-Chairmen and their spouses were terminated in fiscal 2003. Upon termination in fiscal 2003, the Co-Chairmen paid to the Company $5.4 million, representing the total amount of premiums paid by the Company under the agreements and the Company was released from its contractual obligation to make 40 Table of Contents substantial future premium payments. In order to confer a benefit to its Co-Chairmen in substitution for the aforementioned terminated agreements, the Company has agreed to pay to the Co-Chairmen, at a future date, an aggregate amount of $4.2 million, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of February 26, 2011 and February 27, 2010.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Defined Contribution Plans The Company has four defined contribution savings plans covering all eligible employees of the Company (the Plans). Participants of the Plans may defer annual pre-tax compensation subject to statutory and Plan limitations. In addition, a certain percentage of an employees contributions are matched by the Company and vest over a specified period of time, subject to certain statutory and Plan limitations. The Companys match was approximately $8.6 million, $7.6 million and $6.9 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which was expensed as incurred.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan The Company has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (NQDC) for the benefit of employees defined by the Internal Revenue Service as highly compensated. Participants of the NQDC may defer annual pre-tax compensation subject to statutory and plan limitations. In addition, a certain percentage of an employees contributions may be matched by the Company and vest over a specified period of time, subject to certain plan limitations. The Companys match was approximately $0.4 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 which was expensed as incurred.
41 Table of Contents Changes in the fair value of the trading securities related to the NQDC and the corresponding change in the associated liability are included within interest income and selling, general and administrative expenses respectively, in the consolidated statements of earnings. Historically, these changes have resulted in no impact to the consolidated statements of earnings.
Defined Benefit Plan The Company has a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for the CTS employees, hired on or before July 31, 2003, who meet specified age and length-of-service requirements. The benefits are based on years of service and the employees compensation near retirement. The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur. In fiscal 2008, the Company adopted a fiscal year end measurement date and recorded an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings. For the years ended February 26, 2011, February 27, 2010 and February 28, 2009, the net periodic pension cost was not material to the Companys results of operations. The Company has a $7.5 million and $6.8 million liability, which is included in deferred rent and other liabilities as of February 26, 2011 and February 27, 2010, respectively. In addition, as of February 26, 2011 and February 27, 2010, the Company recognized a gain of $0.7 million, net of taxes of $0.4 million, and a gain of $0.3 million, net of taxes of $0.2 million, respectively, within accumulated other comprehensive income.
10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company maintains employment agreements with its Co-Chairmen, which extend through June 2013. The agreements provide for a base salary (which may be increased by the Board of Directors), termination payments, postretirement benefits and other terms and conditions of employment. In addition, the Company maintains employment agreements with other executives which provide for severance pay and, in some instances, certain other supplemental retirement benefits.
The Company records an estimated liability related to its various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business when and to the extent that it concludes a liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such estimated loss is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to claims and legal actions and revises its estimated liabilities, as appropriate. The Company expects the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Company also cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings.
11.
SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION The Company paid income taxes of $487.4 million, $338.9 million and $261.3 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The Company recorded an accrual for capital expenditures of $17.8 million, $21.7 million and $21.6 million as of February 26, 2011, February 27, 2010 and February 28, 2009, respectively.
12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company measures all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and records such expense in its consolidated financial statements. Currently, the Companys stock-based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards.
Stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended February 26, 2011, February 27, 2010 and February 28, 2009 was approximately $44.3 million ($27.1 million after tax or $0.10 per diluted share), approximately $44.2 million ($26.9 million after tax 42 Table of Contents or $0.10 per diluted share) and approximately $43.7 million ($27.2 million after tax or $0.11 per diluted share), respectively. In addition, the amount of stock-based compensation cost capitalized for each of the years ended February 26, 2011 and February 27, 2010 was approximately $1.2 million.
Incentive Compensation Plans The Company currently grants awards under the Bed Bath & Beyond 2004 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2004 Plan). The 2004 Plan is a flexible compensation plan that enables the Company to offer incentive compensation through stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights and performance awards, including cash awards. Under the 2004 Plan, grants are determined by the Compensation Committee for those awards granted to executive officers and by an appropriate committee for all other awards granted. Awards of stock options and restricted stock generally vest in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant.
Prior to fiscal 2004, the Company had adopted various stock option plans (the Prior Plans), all of which solely provided for the granting of stock options. Upon adoption of the 2004 Plan, the common stock available under the Prior Plans became available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. No further option grants may be made under the Prior Plans, although outstanding awards under the Prior Plans will continue to be in effect.
Under the 2004 Plan and the Prior Plans, an aggregate of 83.4 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance. The Company generally issues new shares for stock option exercises and restricted stock awards. As of February 26, 2011, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Companys stock options and restricted stock awards was $21.1 million and $102.9 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.7 years and 4.0 years, respectively.
Stock Options Stock option grants are issued at fair market value on the date of grant and generally become exercisable in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant. Option grants for stock options issued prior to May 10, 2004 expire ten years after the date of grant. Option grants for stock options issued since May 10, 2004 expire eight years after the date of grant. All option grants are nonqualified.
The fair value of the stock options granted was estimated on the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table.

(2) The expected life of stock options is estimated based on historical experience.
(3) Expected volatility is based on the average of historical and implied volatility. The historical volatility is determined by observing actual prices of the Companys stock over a period commensurate with the expected life of the awards. The implied volatility represents the implied volatility of the Companys call options, which are actively traded on multiple exchanges, had remaining maturities in excess of twelve months, had market prices close to the exercise prices of the employee stock options and were measured on the stock option grant date.
(4) Based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options.

The weighted average remaining contractual term and the aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding as of February 26, 2011 was 2.9 years and $109.4 million, respectively. The weighted average remaining contractual term and the aggregate intrinsic value for options exercisable as of February 26, 2011 was 2.3 years and $80.2 million, respectively. The total intrinsic values for stock options exercised during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $50.5 million, $61.9 million and $20.4 million, respectively.
Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options for fiscal 2010 were $125.7 million and the net associated income tax detriment was $0.5 million.
Restricted Stock Restricted stock awards are issued and measured at fair market value on the date of grant and generally become exercisable in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant. Vesting of restricted stock awarded to certain of the Companys executives is dependent on the Companys achievement of a performance-based test for the fiscal year of grant, and assuming achievement of the performance-based test, time vesting, subject, in general, to the executive remaining in the Companys employ on specified vesting dates. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to these awards based on the assumption that the performance-based test will be achieved. Vesting of restricted stock awarded to the Companys other employees is based solely on time vesting.

45 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February26, 2011. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February26, 2011, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated April26, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
/s/   KPMG LLP Short   Hills, New Jersey April26,   2011 46 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Shareholders Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.: We have audited Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, appearing in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity and cash flows and the related financial statement schedule for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February26, 2011, and our report dated April26, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and the related financial statement schedule.
/s/   KPMG LLP Short   Hills, New Jersey April26,   2011 47 Table of Contents ITEM 9 - CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None.
ITEM 9A - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a)Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on their evaluation as of February26, 2011, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules13a-15(e)and 15d-15(e)under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by our management in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i)recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rulesand forms and (ii)accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b)Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f)under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2011. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of February26, 2011, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.
(c)Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm KPMG LLP issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
(d)Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended February26, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide such reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the Companys Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.
