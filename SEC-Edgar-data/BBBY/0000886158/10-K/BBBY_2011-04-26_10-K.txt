Exhibits   and Financial Statement Schedules 2 PARTI Unless otherwise indicated, the term Company refers collectively to Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of March1, 2008. The Companys fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest February28. Accordingly, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2005 represented 52 weeks and ended on March1, 2008 and February25, 2006, respectively. Fiscal 2006 represented 53 weeks and ended on March3, 2007. Unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to periods of time (e.g., quarters and years) are to fiscal periods.
ITEM 1 - BUSINESS Introduction Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath& Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS), Harmon and Harmon Face Values (Harmon) and buybuy BABY (acquired on March22, 2007). The Company sells a wide assortment of merchandise principally including domestics merchandise and home furnishings as well as food, giftware, health and beauty care items and infant and toddler merchandise. The Company believes that it is the nations largest operator of stores selling predominantly domestics merchandise and home furnishings while offering a breadth and depth of selection in most of its product categories that exceeds what is generally available in department stores or other specialty retail stores.
History The Company was founded in 1971 by Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg, the Co-Chairmen of the Company. Each has more than 47 years of experience in the retail industry.
The Company commenced operations in 1971 with the opening of two stores, which primarily sold bed linens and bath accessories. In 1985, the Company introduced its first store carrying a full line of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. The Company began using the name Bed Bath& Beyond in 1987 in order to reflect the expanded product line offered by its stores and to distinguish its stores from conventional specialty retail stores offering only domestics merchandise or home furnishings. In March2002, the Company acquired Harmon, a health and beauty care retailer, which operated 27 stores at the time located in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. In June2003, the Company acquired CTS, a retailer of giftware and household items, which operated 23 stores at the time located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island. In March2007, the Company acquired buybuy BABY, a retailer of infant and toddler merchandise, which operated 8 stores at the time located in Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia. In December2007, the Company opened its first international BBB store in Ontario, Canada.
Operations It is the Companys goal to offer quality merchandise at everyday low prices; to maintain a wide assortment of merchandise; to present merchandise in a distinctive manner designed to maximize customer convenience and reinforce customer perception of wide selection; and to emphasize dedication to customer service and satisfaction.
Pricing.
The Company believes in maintaining everyday low prices. The Company regularly monitors price levels at its competitors in order to ensure that its prices are in accordance with its pricing philosophy. The Company believes that the application of its everyday low price philosophy is an important factor in establishing its reputation among customers.
Merchandise Assortment.
The Company sells a wide assortment of merchandise principally including domestics merchandise and home furnishings as well as food, giftware, health and beauty care items and infant and toddler merchandise. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings includes categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic 3 housewares and general home furnishings. The Company encourages local store personnel to tailor the merchandise mix as appropriate to respond to changing trends and conditions. The factors taken into account in selecting the merchandise mix for a particular store include store size and configuration and local market conditions such as climate and demographics. The Company, on an ongoing basis, tests new merchandise categories and adjusts the categories of merchandise carried in its stores and may add new departments or adjust the size of existing departments as required. Additionally, the Company continues to integrate the merchandise assortments within its concepts. The Company believes that the process of adding new departments, integrating the Companys merchandise within concepts, and expanding or reducing the size of various departments in response to changing conditions is an important part of its merchandising strategy.
Merchandise Presentation.
BBB has developed a distinctive style of merchandise presentation. Primarily all of the BBB stores have groups of related product lines presented together in separate areas of each store, creating the appearance that the store is comprised of several individual specialty stores for different product lines. BBB believes that its format of merchandise presentation makes it easy for customers to locate products, reinforces customer perception of wide selection and communicates to customers that its stores offer a level of customer service generally associated with smaller specialty stores.
BBB believes that its extensive merchandise selection, rather than fixturing, should be the focus of customer attention and, accordingly, primarily uses simple modular fixturing throughout its stores. This fixturing is primarily designed so that it can be easily reconfigured to adapt to changes in the stores merchandise mix and presentation. BBB believes that its merchandise displays create an exciting and attractive shopping environment that encourages impulse purchases of additional items.
Advertising.
In general, the Company relies on word of mouth advertising, its reputation for offering a wide assortment of quality merchandise at everyday low prices and the use of paid advertising. The Company distributes full-color circulars and other advertising pieces as its primary vehicles of paid advertising via direct mail or inserts. Also, to support the opening of new stores, the Company primarily uses grand opening circulars and newspaper advertising.
Customer Service.
The Company places a strong focus on customer service and seeks to make shopping at its stores as pleasant and convenient as possible. Most stores are open seven days (and six evenings) a week in order to enable customers to shop at times that are convenient for them. In addition, the Companys websites, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, www.christmastreeshops.com, www.harmondiscount.com, www.facevalues.com and www.buybuybaby.com are available for customers to access 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Suppliers In fiscal 2007, the Company purchased its merchandise from approximately 5,800 suppliers. In fiscal 2007, the Companys largest supplier accounted for approximately 3% of the Companys merchandise purchases and the Companys 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 19% of such purchases. The Company purchases substantially all of its merchandise in the United States, the majority from domestic sources and the balance from importers. The Company purchases a small amount of its merchandise directly from overseas sources.
The Company has no long-term contracts for the purchase of merchandise. The Company believes that most merchandise, other than brand name goods, is available from a variety of sources and that most brand name goods can be replaced with comparable merchandise.
Warehousing The Companys merchandise displays allow a substantial amount of merchandise to be displayed on the sales floor at all times. Merchandise not displayed on the sales floor is typically stored in warehouse space within the store. In addition, the Company maintains twelve supplemental storage locations as well as three central distribution centers. Merchandise is shipped directly to stores from vendors through a network of third party carriers, service providers and the central distribution centers.
4 In addition, the Company maintains three E-Service fulfillment centers.
Employees As of March1, 2008, the Company employed approximately 39,000 persons in full-time and part-time positions. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are very good and that the labor turnover rate among its management employees is lower than that generally experienced within the industry.
Seasonality The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in August, Novemberand December, and generally lower in Februaryand April.
Expansion Program The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets, the expansion or relocation of existing stores and the continuous review of strategic acquisitions. In the sixteen year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2007, the Company has grown from 34 stores to 971 stores. The Companys 971 stores operate in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, including: 881 BBB stores operating in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 41 CTS stores operating in 10 states; 40 Harmon stores operating in 3 states; and 9 buybuy BABY stores operating in 4 states. Total square footage grew from approximately 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to approximately 30.2 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, the Company opened 66 BBB stores, 7 CTS stores, 1 Harmon store and 1 buybuy BABY store, in addition to acquiring 8 buybuy BABY stores in March2007, all of which resulted in the aggregate addition of approximately 2.4 million square feet of store space.
The Company intends to continue its expansion program and believes that the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, on the success of this program. As part of its expansion program, the Company expects to open new stores and expand existing stores as opportunities arise. The Company opened its first international store in Canada in December2007 and is actively pursuing its expansion opportunities in Canada. In addition, the Company continues to explore other international opportunities.
In determining where to open new stores, the Company evaluates a number of factors, including the availability of real estate, demographic information (such as data relating to income and education levels, age and occupation) and distribution. The Company has built its management structure with a view toward its expansion and believes that, as a result, it has the management depth necessary to support its anticipated expansion program.
Competition The Company believes it is the preeminent retailer in its segment of the home goods industry, which is fragmented and highly competitive. In addition, the BBB stores compete with many different types of retail stores that sell many or most of the same products. Such competitors include: (i)department stores, which often carry many of the same product lines as the Companys stores but do not typically have the same depth or breadth of product selection, (ii)specialty stores, which often have a depth of product selection but typically carry only a limited portion of the product lines carried by the Companys stores, (iii)discount and mass merchandise stores and (iv)national chains. In addition, the Companys stores compete, to a more limited extent, with factory outlet stores that typically offer limited quantities or limited lines of quality merchandise at discount prices.
Other retail chains continue to introduce new store concepts that include many of the product lines carried by the Companys stores. There can be no assurance that the operation of store competitors will not have a material effect on the Company.
5 Tradenames and Service Marks The Company uses the Bed Bath& Beyond name and logo and the Beyond any store of its kind tag line as service marks in connection with retail services. The Company has registered these marks and others, including names and logos of CTS, Harmon and buybuy BABY, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company also has registered or has applications pending with the trademark registries of several foreign countries, including having registered the Bed Bath& Beyond name and logo and the Beyond any store of its kind tag line in Canada. Management believes that its name recognition and service marks are important elements of the Companys merchandising strategy.
Available Information The Company makes available as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), free of charge, through its website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, the Companys annual reports on Form10-K, quarterly reports on Form10-Q, current reports on Form8-K, and amendments to those reports, electronically filed or furnished pursuant to Section13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors that may be outside the Companys control. Such factors include the following: General Economic Conditions General economic factors that are beyond the Companys control impact the Companys forecasts and actual performance. These factors include housing markets, recession, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, fuel and energy costs, interest rates, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, conditions affecting the retail environment for the home and other matters that influence consumer spending. Changes in the economic climate could adversely affect the Companys performance.
Competition and Pricing Pressures The retail business is highly competitive. The Company competes for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of the business with many other local, regional and national retailers. Those competitors range from specialty retail stores to department stores and discounters. Unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of those competitors, including promotional activity, may adversely affect the Companys performance.
Consumer Preferences and Demographic Factors The Companys success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing merchandise trends, customer demands and demographics. The Companys failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in customer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could lead to, among other things, excess inventories or a shortage of products and could have a material adverse affect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.
6 Unusual Weather Patterns The Companys operating results could be negatively impacted by unusual weather patterns. Frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms, hurricanes, floods, tornados or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect the Companys performance.
Cost of Labor, Merchandise and Other Expenses The Companys success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and to look for opportunities to reduce costs. The Companys ability to meet its labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. The Companys ability to find qualified vendors and obtain access to products in a timely and efficient manner can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, transportation costs and other factors beyond the Companys control.
Expansion Program The Companys growth depends, in part, on our ability to open new stores and operate profitably. Our ability to open additional stores successfully will depend on a number of factors, including our identification and availability of suitable store locations; our success in negotiating leases on acceptable terms; our hiring and training of skilled store operating personnel, especially management; and our timely development of new stores, including the availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction and other delays in store openings based on weather or other events. In addition, as our business continues to grow, we are subject to more complex state and federal regulations and may be the target of private actions alleging violations of such regulations. This increases the cost of doing business and the risk that our business practices could result in liabilities that may adversely affect the Companys performance, despite the exercise of reasonable care.
Auction Rate Securities The Company has investments in auction rate securities. These securities are invested in preferred shares of closed end municipal bond funds, which are required, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, to maintain minimum asset coverage ratios of 200% and also are invested in securities collateralized by student loans which are currently more than 100% collateralized and with approximately 90% of such collateral in the aggregate being guaranteed by the United States government. None of the auction rate securities held by the Company are mortgage-backed debt obligations. Due to current market conditions, these investments have experienced failed auctions beginning in mid-February2008. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities, but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. All of these investments carry triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies and the Company believes that given their high credit quality, it will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities. Included in its long term investment securities are approximately $326.7 million par value of auction rate securities, less a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $7.2 million to reflect the current lack of liquidity of these investments. The Company recorded this temporary valuation adjustment in other comprehensive income, net of the related tax benefit of $2.7 million, which did not affect fiscal 2007 earnings, and reclassified these investments to long term investment securities to reflect the current lack of liquidity of these investments. The Company does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in these auction rate securities, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments, including the recent announcements by certain asset managers to redeem a portion of their outstanding auction rate securities. However, if the interest rate environment changes, the Company may incur further unrealized losses. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue and these markets deteriorate further, the Company may conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary and incur realized losses, including up to the full amount of the investments in auction rate securities, which could negatively affect the Companys financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.
7 Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and Related Matters In June2006, the Companys Board of Directors appointed a special committee of independent directors with authority, among other things, to conduct an investigation with respect to the setting of exercise prices for employee stock options and related matters. The review identified various deficiencies in the process of granting and documenting stock options and restricted shares. As a result of the deficiencies, the Company revised the measurement dates for various option grants. Counsel to the special committee notified the SEC of the review. Following such self-reporting, the SEC Staff commenced an informal inquiry and the United States Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey commenced an inquiry regarding these matters. During fiscal 2007, the United States Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey concluded its inquiry and indicated it will take no further action related to this matter. The Company continues to cooperate with the SEC in conjunction with its inquiry.
The Companys past stock option granting process has exposed the Company to risk factors that could have a material adverse affect on the Companys business and financial condition, including the outcome of the informal inquiry commenced by the SEC; the possibility that the SEC may not agree with all of the special committees findings and recommendations as set forth in the Companys Form8-K filed October10, 2006, and may require additional or different remediation; any other proceedings which may be brought against the Company by the SEC or other governmental agencies; any tax implications relating to the Companys stock option grants; the outcome of a shareholder derivative action filed against certain of the Companys officers and directors and related matters; and the possibility of other private litigation relating to such stock option grants and related matters.
ITEM 1B  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES Most of the Companys stores are located in suburban areas of medium and large-sized cities. These stores are situated in strip and power strip shopping centers, as well as in major off-price and conventional malls, and in free standing buildings.
The Companys 971 stores are located in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada and range in size from approximately 5,000 to 100,000 square feet, but are predominantly between 20,000 and 50,000 square feet. Approximately 85% to 90% of store space is used for selling areas and the balance for warehouse, receiving and office space.

The leases provide for original lease terms that generally range from 10 to 20 years and certain leases provide for renewal options, often at increased rents. Certain leases provide for scheduled rent increases (which, in the case of fixed increases, the Company accounts for on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term, beginning when the Company obtains possession of the premises) and/or for contingent rent (based upon store sales exceeding stipulated amounts).
In addition, the Company leases storage space in 15 locations, totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet, that provide supplemental merchandise storage space and fulfillment of BBBs E-Service activities. This space is used to supplement the warehouse facilities in the Companys stores in proximity to these locations. In addition, the Company also owns two distribution centers totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet.
As of March1, 2008, the Company leased a combined total of approximately 160,000 square feet in three locations (Farmingdale, New York; South Yarmouth, Massachusetts; and Garden City, New York) for its procurement and office functions. The Company owns the Union, New Jersey corporate office location and occupies approximately 170,000 square feet of office space at that location. In fiscal 2007, the Company purchased a building in Union, New Jersey next to the corporate office location to support its continuing headquarters growth.
9 ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS During fiscal 2006, two purported derivative actions were filed in New Jersey Superior Court naming several officers and the directors of the Company as defendants and making allegations concerning alleged historical options backdating practices at the Company. Those two actions were consolidated, and a consolidated complaint was filed in late November2006 (the Consolidated State Derivative Case). Subsequently, five additional purported derivative actions were filed, all concerning the same subject matter.
Wandel v. Eisenberg, et al.
was filed on October19, 2006 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York; Jamieson v. Eisenberg, et al . was filed on January5, 2007 in the New Jersey Superior Court; and three cases were filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Snowball Capital Appreciation Fund v. Eisenberg, et al.
; Crowley v. Temares, et al .; and Cummings v. Temares, et al.
on October17, 2006, October24, 2006 and October25, 2006, respectively. The Snowball Capital Appreciation Fund v. Eisenberg, et al.
and Jamieson v. Eisenberg, et al.
cases have been voluntarily dismissed. The Crowley v. Temares, et al . and Cummings v. Temares, et al.
cases have been consolidated (the Consolidated Federal Derivative Case). During the fiscal first quarter of 2007, the Wandel v. Eisenberg, et al . case was dismissed by the Supreme Court of the State of New York, but the plaintiff in the case has filed a notice of appeal. During the fiscal third quarter of 2007, the Consolidated Federal Derivative Case was dismissed by the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2007, the Consolidated State Derivative Case was dismissed by the New Jersey Superior Court. No appeals were filed in either the Consolidated Federal or the Consolidated State Derivative Cases.
In the sole remaining derivative case, Wandel v. Eisenberg, et al.
, the Company is a nominal defendant against which no recovery is sought. The Company has commenced a separate action in the Supreme Court of New York against the shareholders who had brought the Consolidated State Derivative Case, in response to a request to inspect certain materials, which request is deemed by the Company to be improper.
The Company is, in addition, party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, which the Company does not believe to be material to the Companys business or financial condition.
ITEM 4 - SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders through solicitation of proxies or otherwise during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March1, 2008.

13 ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath& Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS), Harmon and Harmon Face Values (Harmon) and buybuy BABY. The Company sells a wide assortment of merchandise principally including domestics merchandise and home furnishings as well as food, giftware, health and beauty care items and infant and toddler merchandise. The Companys objective is to be a customers first choice for products and services in the categories offered, in the markets in which the Company operates.
The Companys strategy is to achieve this objective through excellent customer service, an extensive breadth and depth of assortment, everyday low prices, introduction of new merchandising offerings and development of its infrastructure.
Operating in the highly competitive retail industry, the Company, along with other retail companies, is influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions including the housing market and fuel costs, unusual weather patterns, consumer preferences and spending habits, competition from existing and potential competitors, and the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program.
The Companys fiscal 2007 results reflect the challenges presented by certain macroeconomic conditions, including the economic slowdown, in general; specific issues related to the housing and mortgage industries; and a heightened promotional environment. The following represents an overview of the Companys financial performance for the periods indicated:  Net sales in fiscal 2007 (fifty-two weeks) increased approximately 6.5% to $7.049 billion; net sales in fiscal 2006 (fifty-three weeks) increased approximately 13.9% to $6.617 billion over net sales of $5.810 billion in fiscal 2005 (fifty-two weeks).
Comparable store sales for fiscal 2007 increased by approximately 1.0% as compared with an increase of approximately 4.9% and 4.6% in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Comparable store sales percentages are calculated based on an equivalent number of weeks for each annual period.
A store is considered a comparable store when it has been open for twelve full months following its grand opening period (typically four to six weeks). Stores relocated or expanded are excluded from comparable store sales if the change in square footage would cause meaningful disparity in sales over the prior period. In the case of a store to be closed, such stores sales are not considered comparable once the store closing process has commenced. buybuy BABY is excluded from the comparable store sales percentage for fiscal 2007, but will be included in the Companys comparable store sales calculation starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
Gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $2.925 billion or 41.5% of net sales compared with $2.835 billion or 42.8% of net sales for fiscal 2006 and $2.486 billion or 42.8% of net sales for fiscal 2005.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 were $2.087 billion or 29.6% of net sales compared with $1.946 billion or 29.4% of net sales for fiscal 2006 and $1.607 billion or 27.7% of net sales for fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 includes a non-recurring pre-tax charge of $30 million related to the Companys remediation program intended to protect its employees from certain adverse tax consequences arising pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section409A.
The effective tax rate was 35.0%, 36.3% and 37.4% for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
14  Net earnings for the fiscal year (fifty-two weeks) ended March1, 2008 were $2.10 per diluted share ($562.8 million), compared to fiscal 2006 (fifty-three weeks) net earnings of $2.09 per diluted share ($594.2 million), which included a non-recurring charge of approximately $.07 per diluted share, and fiscal 2005 (fifty-two weeks) net earnings of $1.92 per diluted share ($572.8 million). The increase in net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2007 includes the impact of the Companys repurchases of its common stock.
During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 the Companys capital expenditures were $358.2 million, $317.5 million and $220.4 million. Included in fiscal 2007s capital expenditures were costs associated with a new distribution center and a new E-service fulfillment center to support the Companys growth.
On March22, 2007, the Company acquired buybuy BABY, a retailer of infant and toddler merchandise for approximately $67 million (net of cash acquired) and repayment of debt of approximately $19 million. The acquisition did not have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2007.
Also, in December2007, the Company opened its first international store in Canada and is actively pursuing its expansion opportunities in Canada.
The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long-term objectives.
The Company currently expects to open approximately 50 to 55 new BBB stores throughout the United States and Canada in fiscal 2008.
The Company also expects to open approximately 12 new CTS stores and several buybuy BABY stores as well as continue to open new Harmon stores.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated (i)selected statement of earnings data of the Company expressed as a percentage of net sales and (ii)the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of earnings data: FiscalYearEnded Percentage PercentageChange ofNetSales fromPriorYear March1, March3, February25, March1, March3, 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 6.5 % 13.9 % Cost of sales 58.5 57.2 57.2 9.0 13.8 Gross profit 41.5 42.8 42.8 3.2 14.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 29.6 29.4 27.7 7.3 21.1 Operating profit 11.9 13.4 15.1 (5.8 ) 1.2 Earnings before provision for income taxes 12.3 14.1 15.8 (7.3 ) 1.9 Net earnings 8.0 9.0 9.9 (5.3 ) 3.7 Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2007 (fifty-two weeks) increased $431.5 million to $7.049 billion, representing an increase of 6.5% over the $6.617 billion of net sales in fiscal 2006 (fifty-three weeks), which increased $807.9 million or 15 13.9% over net sales of $5.810 billion in fiscal 2005 (fifty-two weeks). For fiscal 2007, approximately 82% of the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales, 26% of the increase was attributable to the acquisition of buybuy BABY, 15% of the increase was attributable to the increase in comparable store sales, all partially offset by 23% as a result of the additional week of sales in fiscal 2006 . For fiscal 2006, approximately 52% of the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales, and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in comparable store sales and the benefit of an additional week in fiscal 2006. The additional week of sales in fiscal 2006 represented approximately 1.6% of net sales.
For fiscal 2007, comparable store sales for 792 stores represented $6.457 billion of net sales; for fiscal 2006, comparable store sales for 683 stores represented $6.069 billion of net sales; and for fiscal 2005, comparable store sales for 605 stores represented $5.282 billion of net sales. For fiscal 2007, the increase in comparable store sales was approximately 1.0%. The increase in comparable store sales reflects the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings and advertising programs, but was negatively affected by the economic slowdown, in general, and by issues specific to the housing and mortgage industries in particular. In those areas of the Country that have been reported as being the most significantly affected by these issues, notably Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada, sales were noticeably weaker than in less affected areas. For fiscal 2006, the increase in comparable store sales of 4.9% was due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings and a strong focus on customer service with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback. Comparable store sales percentages are calculated based on an equivalent number of weeks for each annual period. buybuy BABY is excluded from the comparable store sales percentage for fiscal 2007, but will be included in the Companys comparable store sales calculation starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
Sales of domestics merchandise accounted for approximately 44%, 46% and 47% of net sales in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, of which the Company estimates that bed linens accounted for approximately 14%, 15% and 16% of net sales in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The remaining net sales in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 of 56%, 54% and 53%, respectively, represented sales of home furnishings and other items. No other individual product category accounted for 10% or more of net sales during fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005.
Gross Profit Gross profit in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $2.925 billion or 41.5% of net sales, $2.835 billion or 42.8% of net sales and $2.486 billion or 42.8% of net sales, respectively. The decrease in gross profit between fiscal 2007 and 2006 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in coupon redemptions associated with a heightened promotional environment, an increase in inventory acquisition costs and the shift in the mix of merchandise sold, as the Company continues to experience a higher percentage of sales of home furnishings.
Selling, General and Administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $2.087 billion or 29.6% of net sales in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.946 billion or 29.4% of net sales in fiscal 2006. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to a relative increase in advertising expense as a result of increased distributions of advertising pieces in response to the heightened promotional environment and a relative increase in occupancy costs and other expenses, partially offset by a relative decrease in payroll and payroll related items (including a non-recurring pre-tax charge of $30 million in fiscal 2006 related to the Companys remediation program intended to protect its employees from certain adverse tax consequences arising pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section409A).
SG&A was $1.946 billion or 29.4% of net sales in fiscal 2006 compared to $1.607 billion or 27.7% of net sales in fiscal 2005. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the non-recurring charge referred to above, the expensing of stock options for twelve months in fiscal 2006 versus six months in fiscal 2005, additional stock-based compensation charges primarily related to the revised measurement dates, increased legal and accounting charges associated with the stock option review (see Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and 16 Related Matters in Fiscal 2006) and an increase in advertising, which included higher paper costs and postal rates. Lastly, there were one-time benefits experienced in fiscal 2005, such as settlement of credit card litigation and certain insurance recoveries, which the Company did not have in fiscal 2006.
Operating Profit Operating profit for fiscal 2007 was $838.0 million or 11.9% of net sales compared to $889.4 million or 13.4% of net sales in fiscal 2006. The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of net sales was a result of the deleverage in the gross margin and SG&A, as discussed above.
Operating profit was $889.4 million or 13.4% of net sales in fiscal 2006 compared to $879.2 million or 15.1% of net sales in fiscal 2005. The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of net sales was the result of the deleverage in SG&A, as discussed above.
Interest Income Interest income in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $27.2 million, $43.5 million and $35.9 million, respectively. Interest income decreased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of lower cash balances principally due to share repurchase activity in fiscal 2007. Interest income increased in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to increases in the Companys average investment interest rates as a result of the upward trend in short term interest rates.
Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 35.0% for fiscal 2007, 36.3% for fiscal 2006 and 37.4% for fiscal 2005. The tax rate for fiscal 2007 included an approximate $21.6 million benefit primarily due to the effective settlement of certain discrete tax items from ongoing examinations, the recognition of favorable discrete state tax items and from changing the blended state tax rate of deferred income taxes. The decrease from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 is primarily due to a reduction in the weighted average effective tax rate resulting from a change in the mix of the business within the taxable jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
The Company expects that Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  An Interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN 48) may, over time, create more volatility in the effective tax rate from year to year because the Company is required each year to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit.
EXPANSION PROGRAM The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets, the expansion or relocation of existing stores and the continuous review of strategic acquisitions. In the sixteen year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2007, the chain has grown from 34 to 971 stores. Total square footage grew from 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to 30.2 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2007. The Company opened its first international BBB store in Ontario, Canada in December2007 and is actively pursuing its expansion opportunities in Canada. In addition, the Company continues to explore other international opportunities.
The Company intends to continue its expansion program and currently expects to open approximately 50 to 55 new BBB stores throughout the United States and Canada in fiscal 2008.
The Company also expects to open approximately 12 new CTS stores and several buybuy BABY stores as well as continue to open new Harmon stores (see details under Liquidity and Capital Resources below). The continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, upon the Companys ability to execute its expansion program successfully.
17 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 The Company has been able to finance its operations, including its expansion program, through internally generated funds. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2007 was $614.5 million, compared with $613.6 million in fiscal 2006. Year over year, the Company experienced an increase in cash provided by net earnings, as adjusted for non-cash expenses (primarily deferred taxes and depreciation), which was offset by a decrease in the net components of working capital (primarily decreases in accounts payable and income taxes offset by an increase in merchandise inventories).
Inventory per square foot was $53.58 and $54.18 as of March1, 2008 and March3, 2007, respectively. The Company continues to focus on optimizing inventory productivity while maintaining appropriate in-store merchandise levels to support sales growth.
Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2007 was $101.7 million, compared with net cash used in investing activities of $397.7 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities was attributable to an increase in the redemptions of investment securities, net of purchases, that was partially offset by the payment of $85.9 million for the acquisition of buybuy BABY and an increase in capital expenditures to $358.2 million in fiscal 2007 from $317.5 million in fiscal 2006.
Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2007 was $705.5 million, compared with $250.3 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to common stock repurchased of $734.2 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $301.0 million in fiscal 2006 under the Companys stock repurchase program.
Fiscal 2006 compared to Fiscal 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2006 was $613.6 million, compared with $660.4 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was principally driven by working capital changes due to the increase in merchandise inventories (primarily as a result of new store space) and an increase in other current assets (due to the timing of prepayments), partially offset by an increase in net earnings and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities (primarily due to the timing of payments). Inventory per square foot was $54.18 and $51.04 as of March3, 2007 and February25, 2006, respectively.
Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2006 was $397.7 million, compared with $67.6 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was attributable to a decrease in redemptions of investment securities and an increase in capital expenditures partially offset by a decrease in purchases of investment securities.
Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2006 was $250.3 million, compared with $567.3 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to common stock repurchased of $301.0 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $598.2 million in fiscal 2005 under the Companys stock repurchase program.
Auction Rate Securities As of March1, 2008, the Company had approximately $326.7 million par value of auction rate securities, less a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $7.2 million to reflect the current lack of liquidity of these investments. The Company recorded this temporary valuation adjustment in other comprehensive income, net of the related tax benefit of $2.7 million, which did not affect fiscal 2007 earnings, and reclassified these investments to long term investment securities to reflect the lack of liquidity of these investments. Due to current market conditions, these investments have experienced failed auctions beginning in mid-February2008. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities, but do not affect the underlying collateral of the 18 securities. All of these investments carry triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies and the Company believes that given their high credit quality, it will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities. The Company does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in these auction rate securities, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments, including the recent announcements by certain asset managers to redeem a portion of their outstanding auction rate securities. These investments are classified as non-current assets until the Company has better visibility as to when their liquidity will be restored. The classification and valuation of these securities will be reviewed quarterly.
Other Fiscal 2007 Information At March1, 2008, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million each, with expiration dates of September3, 2008 and February27, 2009, respectively. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently and are expected to be used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. In addition, under these uncommitted lines of credit, the Company can obtain unsecured standby letters of credit. During fiscal 2007, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of March1, 2008, there was approximately $8.1 million of outstanding letters of credit and approximately $49.8 million of outstanding unsecured standby letters of credit, primarily for certain insurance programs. Although no assurances can be provided, the Company intends to renew both uncommitted lines of credit before the respective expiration dates. The Company believes that during fiscal 2008, internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund its operations, including its expansion program and planned capital expenditures.
The Companys Board of Directors has authorized repurchases of shares of its common stock for $1 billion in September2007, for $1 billion in December2006, for $200 million in January2006, for $400 million in October2005 and for $350 million in December2004. The Company was authorized to make repurchases from time to time in the open market or through other parameters approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to existing rulesand regulations. The Company has approximately $967 million remaining of authorized share repurchases as of March1, 2008. The execution of the Companys current share repurchase program will consider current economic and market conditions, including but not limited to, the liquidity of its auction rate security investments.
The Company has contractual obligations consisting mainly of operating leases for stores, offices, warehouse facilities and equipment, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities which the Company is obligated to pay as of March1, 2008 as follows: Lessthan1 After5 (inthousands) Total year 1-3years 4-5years years Operating Lease Obligations (1) $ 3,195,366 $ 404,197 $ 776,185 $ 642,058 $ 1,372,926 Purchase Obligations (2) 433,630 433,630    Other long-term liabilities (3) 268,153     Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,897,149 $ 837,827 $ 776,185 $ 642,058 $ 1,372,926 (1) The amounts presented represent the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases. In addition to minimum rent, certain of the Companys leases require the payment of additional costs for insurance, maintenance and other costs. These additional amounts are not included in the table of contractual commitments as the timing and/or amounts of such payments are not known. As of March1, 2008, the Company has leased sites for 56 new stores planned for opening in fiscal 2008 or 2009, for which aggregate minimum rental payments over the term of the leases are approximately $261.7 million and are included in the table above.
(2) Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise and capital expenditures.
(3) The Companys deferred rent and other liabilities as well as income taxes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March1, 2008 are primarily comprised of deferred rent, income taxes, workers compensation and general liability reserves and other various accruals. As the timing and/or amounts of any cash payment is uncertain, the related amounts have been reflected only in the Total column in the table above.
19 SEASONALITY The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in August, Novemberand December, and generally lower in Februaryand April.
INFLATION The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June2006, the FASB issued FIN 48. FIN 48 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, a company may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities. FIN 48 also provided guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.
On March4, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48 and recognized a $13.1 million increase to Retained earnings to reflect the change to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits as required. The Company also recorded additional unrecognized tax benefits, and corresponding higher deferred tax assets, of $35.6 million as a result of the adoption.
In September2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No.157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No.157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No.157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The FASB has issued a one-year deferral of SFAS No.157s fair value measurement requirements for non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Although SFAS No.157 will require additional disclosures about fair value measurements, the Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.157 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.115. SFAS No.159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (the fair value option). If the fair value option is elected, any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred, e.g. debt issue costs. The fair value election is irrevocable and may generally be made on an instrument-by-instrument basis, even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to fair value. At the adoption date, unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. SFAS No.159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No.159 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS No.141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair value. SFAS No.141R determines what information to disclose to enable users 20 of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No.141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008. Early adoption is not permitted.
REVIEW OF EQUITY GRANTS AND PROCEDURES AND RELATED MATTERS IN FISCAL 2006 As a result of revised measurement dates for certain stock option grants, and the correction of various other errors, the Company determined that it had certain unrecorded non-cash equity-based compensation charges of $61.8 million, including related tax items related to fiscal years prior to 2006. In accordance with the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, the Company decreased beginning Retained earnings for fiscal 2006 by $61.8 million within the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Companys Board of Directors also approved a remediation program intended to protect over 1,600 employees from certain potential adverse tax consequences. These adverse tax consequences arise pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section409A as a result of historical deficiencies associated with certain of the Companys stock option grants that were disclosed through the Companys stock option review. As a result of this program, the Company made cash payments totaling approximately $30.0 million to over 1,600 employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, which resulted in a non-recurring, pre-tax stock-based compensation charge. The cash outlay primarily represented payments to employees in connection with increasing the exercise prices on certain stock option grants so as to protect them from certain potential adverse tax consequences. No executive officer received such payments. The Company believes it is likely the Company will recoup a substantial portion of the anticipated cash outlay over the next several years through higher proceeds from future stock option exercises, although this recovery would not flow through the income statement.
The Company also filed a Form8-K dated December28, 2006 which provides further details regarding the remediation program.
The Company continues to cooperate with the inquiry of the SEC regarding the Companys stock option grant practices.
The United States Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey concluded its inquiry with respect to matters arising out of and related to the Companys historical stock option grants and procedures and related matters and has indicated it will take no further action related to this matter.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, accruals for self insurance, litigation, store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Inventory Valuation : Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB and Harmon are calculated using the weighted average retail inventory method and inventory costs for CTS and buybuy BABY are calculated using the first in first out cost method.
Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated 21 by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail values of inventories. The cost associated with determining the cost to retail ratio includes: merchandise purchases, net of returns to vendors, discounts and volume and incentive rebates; inbound freight expenses; duty, insurance and commissions.
At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions.
The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year, based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory count. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile.
The Company accrues for merchandise in transit once it takes legal ownership and title to the merchandise; as such, an estimate for merchandise in transit is included in the Companys merchandise inventories.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.
Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets : The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Self Insurance : The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
Litigation : The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates, as appropriate. The ultimate resolution of these ongoing matters as a result of future developments could have a material impact on the Companys earnings. The Company cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings.
Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs : Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred.
22 Stock-Based Compensation: Under SFAS No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No.123R), the Company uses a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options. The Black-Scholes model includes various assumptions, including the expected life of stock options, the expected risk free interest rate and the expected volatility. These assumptions reflect the Companys best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of the Company. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, total stock-based compensation cost, as determined in accordance with SFAS No.123R, could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if the Company uses different assumptions for future grants, stock-based compensation cost could be materially impacted in future periods.
The Company determines its assumptions for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in accordance with SFAS No.123R and/or SAB No.107, Share-Based Payment.
The expected life of stock options is estimated based on historical experience.
The expected risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options.
The expected volatility is based solely on the implied volatility of the Companys call options. The Companys call options used to determine implied volatility are actively traded on multiple exchanges, had remaining maturities in excess of twelve months, had market prices close to the exercise prices of the employee stock options and were measured on the stock option grant date. The Company believes the resulting implied volatility used to determine the fair value of its stock options represents what marketplace participants would likely use in determining an exchange price for an option.
The Company is required to record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. The Companys forfeiture rate assumption used in determining its stock-based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data. The actual forfeiture rate could differ from these estimates.
Income Taxes : The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of its Canadian subsidiary. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes in most cases.
During the first quarter of 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48. Under FIN 48, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.
The Company expects that FIN 48 may, over time, create more volatility in the effective tax rate from quarter to quarter because the Company is required each quarter to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit.
Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
23 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form10-K and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors that may be outside the Companys control. Such factors include, without limitation: general economic conditions including the housing market and fuel costs; changes in the retailing environment and consumer preferences and spending habits; demographics and other macroeconomic factors that may impact the level of spending for the types of merchandise sold by the Company; unusual weather patterns; competition from existing and potential competitors; competition from other channels of distribution; pricing pressures; the cost of labor, merchandise and other costs and expenses; the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program; the impact of failed auctions for auction rate securities held by the Company; and matters arising out of or related to the Companys stock option grants and procedures and related matters, including the outcome of the informal inquiry commenced by the SEC, the possibility that the SEC may not agree with all of the special committees findings and recommendations and may require additional or different remediation, any other proceedings which may be brought against the Company by the SEC or other governmental agencies, any tax implications relating to the Companys stock option grants, the outcome of a shareholder derivative action filed against certain of the Companys officers and directors and related matters, and the possibility of other private litigation relating to such stock option grants and related matters.
ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of March1, 2008, the Companys investments include cash and cash equivalents of $224.1 million and long term investment securities of $326.0 million at weighted average interest rates of 2.2% and 4.4%, respectively. The Company had no short term investment securities as of March1, 2008.
Included in its long term investment securities, the Company has approximately $326.7 million par value of auction rate securities, less a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $7.2 million to reflect the current lack of liquidity of these investments. The Company recorded this temporary valuation adjustment in other comprehensive income, net of the related tax benefit of $2.7 million, which did not affect fiscal 2007 earnings, and reclassified these investments to long term investment securities to reflect the current lack of liquidity of these investments. Due to current market conditions, these investments have experienced failed auctions beginning in mid-February2008. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities, but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. All of these investments carry triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies and the Company believes that given their high credit quality, it will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities. The Company does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in these auction rate securities, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments, including the recent announcements by certain asset managers to redeem a portion of their outstanding auction rate securities. However, if the interest rate environment changes, the Company may incur further unrealized losses. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue and these markets deteriorate further, the Company may conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary and incur realized losses, including up to the full amount of the investments in auction rate securities, which could negatively affect the Companys financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.

29 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and Subsidiaries 1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED MATTERS A.
Nature of Operations Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath& Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS), Harmon and Harmon Face Values (Harmon) and buybuy BABY, which was acquired on March22, 2007. (See Acquisition, Note 2). The Company sells a wide assortment of merchandise principally including domestics merchandise and home furnishings as well as food, giftware, health and beauty care items and infant and toddler merchandise. As the Company operates in the retail industry, its results of operations are affected by general economic conditions and consumer spending habits.
B.
Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest February28. Accordingly, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2005 represented 52 weeks and ended on March1, 2008 and February25, 2006, respectively; fiscal 2006 represented 53 weeks and ended on March3, 2007.
C.
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
D.
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as impairment of auction rate securities, inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, accruals for self insurance, litigation, store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, the provision for sales returns, vendor allowances, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
E.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Included in cash and cash equivalents are credit and debit card receivables from banks, which typically settle within 5 business days, of $49.3 million and $44.3 million as of March1, 2008 and March3, 2007, respectively.
F.
Investment Securities Investment securities primarily consist of auction rate securities, U.S. Government Agency debt securities and municipal debt securities. Auction rate securities are securities with interest rates that reset periodically through an auction process. Auction rate securities are classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, which had 30 historically been consistent with cost or par value due to interest rates which reset periodically, typically every 7, 28 or 35 days. As a result, there generally were no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains or losses relating to these auction rate securities. However, due to current market conditions, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities has recently failed beginning in mid-February2008. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities, and affect their estimated fair values at March1, 2008, but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. (See Investment Securities, Note 6). All income from these investments is recorded as interest income.
Those investment securities which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments and are stated at amortized cost. Those investment securities which are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are stated at fair market value.
Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted over the life of the security as adjustments to interest income using the effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
G.
Inventory Valuation Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB and Harmon are calculated using the weighted average retail inventory method and inventory costs for CTS and buybuy BABY are calculated using the first in first out cost method.
Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail values of inventories. The cost associated with determining the cost to retail ratio includes: merchandise purchases, net of returns to vendors, discounts and volume and incentive rebates; inbound freight expenses; duty, insurance and commissions.
At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions.
The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year, based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory count. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile.
The Company accrues for merchandise in transit once it takes legal ownership and title to the merchandise; as such, an estimate for merchandise in transit is included in the Companys merchandise inventories.
H.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (forty years for buildings; five to twenty years for furniture, fixtures and equipment; and three to seven years for computer equipment and software). Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful life or the life of the lease. Depreciation expense is included within Selling, general and administrative expenses.
The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to earnings as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs amounted to $72.9 million, $67.0 million and $54.2 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
31 I.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.
J.
Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Included within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March1, 2008 and March3, 2007 is $198.4 million and $147.6 million, respectively, for goodwill, and $30.9 million and $19.9 million, respectively, for tradenames, which are not subject to amortization. The increase in goodwill was attributable to a $61.3 million increase as a result of the acquisition of buybuy BABY, partially offset by a $10.5 million decrease due to the favorable resolution of a tax contingency related to a prior acquisition. Tradenames increased as a result of the acquisition of buybuy BABY.
K.
Self Insurance The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
L.
Deferred Rent The Company accounts for scheduled rent increases contained in its leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease beginning as of the date the Company obtained possession of the leased premises. Deferred rent amounted to $77.8 million and $74.9 million as of March1, 2008 and March3, 2007, respectively.
Cash or lease incentives (tenant allowances) received pursuant to certain store leases are recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction to rent over the lease term. The unamortized portion of tenant allowances is included in deferred rent and other liabilities. Tenant allowances amounted to $51.0 million and $34.5 million as of March1, 2008 and March3, 2007, respectively.
32 M.
Treasury Stock The Companys Board of Directors has authorized repurchases of shares of its common stock for $1 billion in September2007, for $1 billion in December2006, for $200 million in January2006, for $400 million in October2005 and for $350 million in December2004. The Company was authorized to make repurchases from time to time in the open market or through other parameters approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to existing rulesand regulations. During fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 20.6 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $734.2 million. During fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $301.0 million. During fiscal 2005, the Company repurchased approximately 16.4 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $598.2 million.
N.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, accounts payable and certain other liabilities. The Companys investment securities consist primarily of available-for-sale debt securities which are stated at their approximate fair value. The book value of all financial instruments is representative of their fair values with the exception of certain investment securities (See Investment Securities, Note 6).
O.
Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at the Companys retail stores or upon delivery for products purchased from its websites. The value of point of sale coupons and point of sale rebates that result in a reduction of the price paid by the customer are recorded as a reduction of sales. Shipping and handling fees that are billed to a customer in a sale transaction are recorded in sales. Taxes, such as sales tax, use tax and value added tax, are not included in sales.
Revenues from gift cards, gift certificates and merchandise credits are recognized when redeemed. Gift cards have no provisions for reduction in the value of unused card balances over defined time periods and have no expiration dates, but are subject to state escheat regulations; as such, the Company does not record income associated with unredeemed gift cards.
Sales returns are provided for in the period that the related sales are recorded based on historical experience. Although the estimate for sales returns has not varied materially from historical provisions, actual experience could vary from historical experience in the future if the level of sales return activity changes materially. In the future, if the Company concludes that an adjustment to the sales return accrual is required due to material changes in the returns activity, the reserve will be adjusted accordingly.
P.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise, buying costs and costs of the Companys distribution network including inbound freight charges, distribution facility costs, receiving costs, internal transfer costs and shipping and handling costs.
Q.
Vendor Allowances The Company receives allowances from vendors in the normal course of business for various reasons including direct cooperative advertising, purchase volume and reimbursement for other expenses. Annual terms for each allowance include the basis for earning the allowance and payment terms which vary by agreement. All vendor allowances are recorded as a reduction of inventory cost, except for direct cooperative advertising allowances which are specific, incremental and identifiable. The Company recognizes purchase volume allowances as a reduction of the cost of inventory in the quarter in which milestones are achieved. Advertising costs were reduced by direct 33 cooperative allowances of $11.1 million, $10.6 million and $9.4 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
R.
Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred.
S.
Advertising Costs Expenses associated with direct response advertising are expensed over the period during which the sales are expected to occur, generally four to six weeks, and all other expenses associated with store advertising are charged to earnings as incurred. Net advertising costs amounted to $239.6 million, $198.4 million and $158.2 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
T.
Stock-Based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No.123R) which requires companies to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted SFAS No.123R on August28, 2005 (the date of adoption) under the modified prospective application. Under this application, the Company records stock-based compensation expense for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption and for the portion of previously granted awards that remained unvested at the date of adoption. Currently, the Companys stock-based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards as defined under SFAS No.123R.
Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company applied the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB No.25) as permitted under SFAS No.148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure  an amendment of FASB Statement No.123 (SFAS No.148) and complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123. During the first half of fiscal 2005, which ended on August27, 2005, the Company recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards over the service period, but did not recognize compensation expense for stock options, since the Company historically has treated its stock options as having been granted at fair market value on the date of grant (however, see Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and Related Matters in Fiscal 2006, Note 13 for a discussion of a special committee review of equity grant matters which resulted in, among other things, the use of revised measurement dates for certain grants).
U.
Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return. Income tax returns are also filed with each taxable jurisdiction in which the Company conducts business.
The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of its Canadian subsidiary. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the 34 U.S., such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes in most cases.
During the first quarter of 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN 48). Under FIN 48, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.
Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
V.
Litigation The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates, as appropriate. The ultimate resolution of these ongoing matters as a result of future developments could have a material impact on the Companys earnings. The Company cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings.
W.
Earnings per Share The Company presents earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis. Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding including the dilutive effect of stock-based awards as calculated under the treasury stock method.
Stock-based awards of approximately 10.9 million, 8.6 million and 4.9 million shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
X.
Segments The Company accounts for its operations as one operating segment.
Y.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No.157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No.157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No.157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The FASB has issued a one-year deferral of SFAS No.157s fair value measurement requirements for non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Although SFAS No.157 will require additional disclosures about fair value measurements, the Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.157 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial 35 Liabilities-Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.115. SFAS No.159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (the fair value option). If the fair value option is elected, any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred, e.g. debt issue costs. The fair value election is irrevocable and may generally be made on an instrument-by-instrument basis, even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to fair value. At the adoption date, unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. SFAS No.159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company does not believe SFAS No.159 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS No.141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair value. SFAS No.141R determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No.141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008. Early adoption is not permitted.
2.
ACQUISITION On March22, 2007, the Company completed and announced the acquisition of buybuy BABY, a retailer of infant and toddler merchandise, for approximately $67 million (net of cash acquired) and repayment of debt of approximately $19 million. Based in Garden City, New York, buybuy BABY operated a total of 8 stores at the time of acquisition, in Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia. The stores range in size from approximately 28,000 to 60,000 square feet and offer a broad assortment of premier infant and toddler merchandise in categories including furniture, car seats, strollers, feeding, bedding, bath, health and safety essentials, toys, learning and development products, clothing and a unique selection of seasonal and holiday products. (See Transactions and Balances with Related Parties, Note 8).
The results of buybuy BABYs operations, which are not material, have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.
3. STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108, CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In September2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. The transition provisions of SAB 108 permit the Company to adjust for the cumulative effect on retained earnings of immaterial errors relating to prior years. SAB 108 also requires the adjustment of any prior quarterly financial statements within the fiscal year of adoption for the effects of such errors on the quarters when the information is next presented. Such adjustments do not require previously filed reports with the SEC to be amended. The Company adopted SAB 108 at the end of fiscal 2006. In accordance with SAB 108, the Company adjusted beginning retained earnings for fiscal 2006 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the items described below. The Company considers these adjustments to be immaterial to prior periods.
Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and Related Matters in Fiscal 2006 In June2006, the Companys Board of Directors appointed a special committee of two independent members of the Board of Directors, with authority, among other things, to conduct an investigation with respect to the setting of exercise prices for employee stock options and related matters as the special committee deemed appropriate. The special committee retained independent counsel who engaged outside accounting advisors to assist with the review. This review was completed and on October9, 2006, the special committee presented its report to the Companys Board of Directors.
36 The review of stock option grants and procedures identified various deficiencies in the process of granting and documenting stock options and restricted shares described below. As a result of the deficiencies, the special committee recommended, among other things, that the Company revise the measurement dates under APB No.25, for 16 annual option grant dates, 26 monthly grant dates and 2 special grant dates (revisions of 2 annual, 4 monthly and 1 special grant dates have no accounting impact because prices on the revised dates were lower than on the measurement dates previously recorded by the Company). As a result of these revised measurement dates and the correction of various other errors relating to the accounting for equity-based compensation, the Company determined that from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal 2005, it had certain unrecorded non-cash equity-based compensation charges associated with its equity-based compensation plans.
As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment for unrecorded expense over the affected period (fiscal year 1993 through 2005) of $61.8 million, including related tax items. In accordance with the provisions of SAB 108, the Company decreased beginning retained earnings for fiscal year 2006 by $61.8 million within the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company does not believe that the net effect of this adjustment was material, either quantitatively or qualitatively, in any of the years covered by the review. In reaching that determination, the following quantitative measures were considered: (inthousands) NetAdjustment,After NetAdjustment, NetIncome Taxasa%ofNet FiscalYear AfterTax AsReported IncomeAsReported 2005 $ 11,488 $ 572,847 2.01 % 2004 12,493 504,964 2.47 % 2003 13,607 399,470 3.41 % 2002 8,600 302,179 2.85 % 2001 7,391 219,599 3.37 % 2000 5,272 171,922 3.07 % 1999 1,340 131,229 1.02 % 1998 923 97,346 0.95 % 1997 405 73,142 0.55 % 1996 163 55,015 0.30 % 1995 56 39,459 0.14 % 1994 22 30,013 0.07 % 1993 2 21,887 0.01 % Total $ 61,762 Rent and Lease Accounting The Company accounts for scheduled rent increases contained in its leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In fiscal 2004, due to clarification by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC, the Company changed its method of accounting to define the beginning of the lease term as the date the Company obtained possession of the leased premises. Prior to fiscal 2004, the Companys method of accounting defined the beginning of the lease term as the date the Company commenced lease payments. The Company recorded an adjustment to retained earnings and deferred rent and other liabilities to reflect these accounts as if the Company had always defined the beginning of the lease term as the date the Company obtained possession of the leased premises and to correspondingly increase deferred tax assets. The Company does not believe that the net effect of this adjustment which includes fiscal years 1993 through 2003 was material.
37 Impact of Adjustments The impact of each of the items noted above, net of tax, on fiscal 2006 beginning balances are presented below: Review of Stock Option Grant Rent& Practices, Including Lease (in thousands) Related TaxItems Accounting Total Other Assets $ 11,273 $ 4,738 $ 16,011 Income Taxes   Payable (34,747 )  (34,747 ) Deferred   Rent and Other Liabilities  (15,588 ) (15,588 ) Additional   Paid-in Capital (38,288 )  (38,288 ) Retained   Earnings 61,762 10,850 72,612 Total $  $  $  4.

LINES OF CREDIT At March1, 2008, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million each, with expiration dates of September3, 2008 and February27, 2009, respectively. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently and are expected to be used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. In addition, under these uncommitted lines of credit, the Company can obtain unsecured standby letters of credit. During fiscal 2007, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of March1, 2008, there was approximately $8.1 million of outstanding letters of credit and approximately $49.8 million of outstanding unsecured standby letters of credit, primarily for certain insurance programs. Although no assurances can be provided, the Company intends to renew both uncommitted lines of credit before the respective expiration dates.
At March3, 2007, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million and $75 million. These uncommitted lines of credit were utilized for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. During fiscal 2006, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of March3, 2007, there was approximately $6.9 million of outstanding letters of credit and approximately $40.0 million of outstanding unsecured standby letters of credit, primarily for certain insurance programs.
38 6.
INVESTMENT SECURITIES The Companys investment securities as of March1, 2008 and March3, 2007 are as follows: March1, March3, (inmillions) 2008 2007 Available-for-salesecurities: Short term  378.0 Long term 319.5  319.5 378.0 Trading Securities: Short term  3.4 Long term 6.4  6.4 3.4 Held-to-maturity securities: Short term $  $ 393.5 Long term 0.1 102.7 0.1 496.2 Total investment securities $ 326.0 $ 877.6 Available-for-sale securities As of March1, 2008, the Company had approximately $326.7 million par value of auction rate securities, less a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $7.2 million to reflect the current lack of liquidity of these investments. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed to be temporary, it was recorded in other comprehensive income, net of the related tax benefit of $2.7 million, and did not affect the Companys earnings for fiscal 2007. The Company reclassified these investments to long term investment securities at March1, 2008 to reflect the current lack of liquidity of these investments. All of these investments carry triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies. Approximately $283.5 million of these securities at par are invested in preferred shares of closed end municipal bond funds, which are required, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, to maintain minimum asset coverage ratios of 200%. The remaining approximate $43.2 million at par are invested in securities collateralized by student loans which are currently more than 100% collateralized and with approximately 90% of such collateral in the aggregate being guaranteed by the United States government. None of the auction rate securities held by the Company are mortgage-backed debt obligations.
The Companys auction rate securities carry interest rates that reset periodically, every 7, 28 or 35 days, through an auction process. Due to current market conditions, these investments have experienced failed auctions beginning in mid-February2008. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities, but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. Upon the auction failures of the securities held by the Company, the interest rates reset based on a predetermined maximum contractual rate, which is nominally higher than the interest rates earned prior to the auction failures. The Company continues to earn and receive interest on these securities. The Companys auction rate securities will continue to be presented for auction every 7, 28 or 35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the security, or they mature, as in the case of securities collateralized by student loans.
Trading securities The Companys trading securities, which are provided as investment options to the participants of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, are stated at fair market value. (See Employee Benefit Plans, Note 10).
Held-to-maturity securities As of March3, 2007, the Companys held-to-maturity investment securities consisted of U.S. Government Agency 39 debt securities and municipal debt securities. Actual maturities could differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call certain obligations. As of March3, 2007, the fair value of short term and long term held-to-maturity securities was $393.0 million and $102.5 million, respectively. As of March3, 2007, the Company had gross unrecognized holding losses of approximately $1.3 million, relating to held-to-maturity investment securities with fair values totaling $405.8 million.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows: FISCALYEARENDED March1, March3, February25, (inthousands) 2008 2007 2006 Current: Federal $ 276,986 $ 375,800 $ 331,930 State and local 23,123 50,060 36,188 300,109 425,860 368,118 Deferred: Federal 5,483 (81,067 ) (24,681 ) State and local (3,168 ) (6,158 ) (1,193 ) 2,315 (87,225 ) (25,874 ) $ 302,424 $ 338,635 $ 342,244 At March1, 2008 and March3, 2007, included in other current assets and in other assets is a net current deferred income tax asset of $137.2 million and $119.4 million, respectively, and a net noncurrent deferred income tax asset of $81.4 million and $58.5 million, respectively. These amounts represent the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following: March1, March3, (inthousands) 2008 2007 Deferred Tax Assets: Inventories $ 30,074 $ 28,751 Deferred rent and other rent credits 51,507 42,643 Insurance 37,899 36,398 Stock-based compensation 55,511 46,696 Merchandise credits and gift card liabilities 26,350 42,731 Accrued expenses 49,508 17,824 Other 17,211 12,776 Deferred Tax Liabilities: Depreciation (22,066 ) (33,360 ) Other (27,361 ) (16,566 ) $ 218,633 $ 177,893 The Company has not established a valuation allowance for the net deferred tax asset as it is considered more likely 40 than not that it is realizable through a combination of future taxable income, the deductibility of future net deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies.
The Company adopted FIN 48 on March4, 2007 (FIN 48 Adoption Date). FIN 48 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities. FIN 48 also provided guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.
Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Company recognized a $13.1 million increase to retained earnings to reflect the change to its liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits as required. The Company also recorded additional gross unrecognized tax benefits, and corresponding higher deferred tax assets, of $35.6 million as a result of the adoption. At March4, 2007 the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $163.3 million, of which $119.9 million would impact the Companys effective tax rate. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. As of March4, 2007, the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits included approximately $27.5 million of accrued interest.
Set forth below is the tabular roll-forward of the gross unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions for the fiscal year ended March1, 2008: (inthousands) Balance as of March4, 2007 (FIN 48   Adoption Date) $ 163,297 Increase related to current year positions 16,920 Increase related to prior year positions 36,584 Decrease related to prior year positions (81,330 ) Settlements (44,175 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (2,617 ) Other (5,540 ) Balance as of March1, 2008 $ 83,139 At March1, 2008, the Company has recorded approximately $7.7 million and $75.4 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits in current and non-current taxes payable, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet of which approximately $76.0 million would impact the Companys effective tax rate. As of March1, 2008, the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits included approximately $14.3 million of accrued interest. For the year ended March1, 2008, the Company recorded a reduction of interest for gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $1.9 million in the consolidated statement of earnings.
The Company anticipates that any adjustments to gross unrecognized tax benefits which will impact income tax expense, due to the settlement of audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations, will not exceed $1.0 million in the next twelve months. However, actual results could differ from those currently anticipated.
As of March1, 2008, the Company operated in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada and files income tax returns in the United States and various state, local and international jurisdictions. The Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2001 through 2005. The Company is also open to examination for state and local jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations, generally ranging from three to five years.
41 For fiscal 2007, the effective tax rate is comprised of the Federal statutory income tax rate of 35.00%, the State income tax rate, net of Federal benefit, of 2.57% and other income tax benefits of 2.62%. Included in other income tax benefits are the settlement of certain discrete tax items from ongoing examinations, the recognition of favorable discrete state tax items and from changing the blended state tax rate of deferred income taxes. For fiscal 2006, the effective tax rate is comprised of the Federal statutory income tax rate of 35.00%, the State income tax rate, net of Federal benefit, of 3.06% and other income tax benefits of 1.76%.

TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES WITH RELATED PARTIES A.
In fiscal 2002, the Company had an interest in certain life insurance policies on the lives of its Co-Chairmen and their spouses. The Companys interest in these policies was equivalent to the net premiums paid by the Company. The agreements relating to the Companys interest in the life insurance policies on the lives of its Co-Chairmen and their spouses were terminated in fiscal 2003. Upon termination in fiscal 2003, the Co-Chairmen paid to the Company $5.4 million, representing the total amount of premiums paid by the Company under the agreements and the Company was released from its contractual obligation to make substantial future premium payments. In order to confer a benefit to its Co-Chairmen in substitution for the aforementioned terminated agreements, the Company has agreed to pay to the Co-Chairmen, at a future date, an aggregate amount of $4.2 million, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of March1, 2008 and March3, 2007.
B.
In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company leased office and retail space from entities controlled by management of CTS. In fiscal 2007, the Company leased retail space from entities controlled by management of buybuy BABY. The Company paid such entities occupancy costs of approximately $7.1 million, $6.3 million and $6.5 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
C.
On March22, 2007, the Company acquired buybuy BABY, a retailer of infant and toddler merchandise, for approximately $67 million (net of cash acquired) and repayment of debt of approximately $19 million. buybuy BABY was founded in 1996 by Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein, both of whom were previously employed by the Company, and are the sons of Leonard Feinstein, one of the Companys Co-Chairmen. The aforementioned repayment of approximately $19 million of debt resulted in the retirement of all indebtedness of buybuy BABY, which debt was held by Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein (approximately $16 million) and Leonard Feinstein (approximately $3 million). The Companys Co-Chairmen, Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg, recused themselves from deliberations relating to the transaction.
9.
LEASES The Company leases retail stores, as well as warehouses, office facilities and equipment, under agreements expiring at various dates through 2041. Certain leases provide for contingent rents (which are based upon store sales exceeding stipulated amounts and are immaterial in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005), scheduled rent increases and renewal options. The Company is obligated under a majority of the leases to pay for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges.
42 As of March1, 2008, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows: FiscalYear Amount (inthousands) 2008 $ 404,197 2009 401,271 2010 374,914 2011 340,924 2012 301,134 Thereafter 1,372,926 Total future minimum lease payments $ 3,195,366 Expenses for all operating leases were $380.5 million, $355.7 million and $322.0 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
10.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Defined Contribution Plans The Company has two defined contribution savings plans covering all eligible employees of the Company (the Plans). During fiscal 2006, a 401(k)savings plan, which was frozen effective December31, 2003, was merged into one of the Plans. Participants of the Plans may defer annual pre-tax compensation subject to statutory and Plan limitations. Effective January1, 2006, a certain percentage of an employees contributions, will be matched by the Company, subject to certain statutory and Plan limitations. This match will vest over a specified period of time. The Companys match was approximately $5.9 million, $4.8 million and $0.5 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which was expensed as incurred.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of employees defined by the Internal Revenue Service as highly compensated. A certain percentage of an employees contributions may be matched by the Company, subject to certain Plan limitations. This match will vest over a specified period of time. The Companys match was approximately $0.7 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which was expensed as incurred.
Defined Benefit Plan The Company has a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for the CTS employees, hired on or before July31, 2003, who meet specified age and length-of-service requirements. The benefits are based on years of service and the employees compensation near retirement. The Company utilizes a December31 measurement date for this plan. In fiscal 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  an Amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 88, 106 and 132(R), on a prospective basis. SFAS No.158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur. For the years ended March1, 2008 and March3, 2007, the net periodic pension cost was not material to the Companys results of operations. The Company has a $0.7 million and $1.1 million liability, which is included in deferred rent and other liabilities as of March1, 2008 and March3, 2007, respectively. In addition, as of March1, 2008 and March3, 2007, the Company recognized $3.6 million, net of the related tax benefit of $2.2 million, and $4.4 million, net of the related tax benefit of $2.6 million, respectively, within accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.
43 11 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company maintains employment agreements with its Co-Chairmen, which extend through June2010. The agreements provide for a base salary (which may be increased by the Board of Directors), termination payments, post-retirement benefits and other terms and conditions of employment. In addition, the Company maintains employment agreements with other executives which provide for severance pay and, in some instances, certain other supplemental retirement benefits.
The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
12.
SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION The Company paid income taxes of $359.9 million, $388.4 million and $338.7 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The Company recorded an accrual for capital expenditures of $36.6 million, $53.9 million and $49.6 million as of March1, 2008, March3, 2007 and February25, 2006, respectively.
13.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company records stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No.123R which requires companies to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted SFAS No.123R on August28, 2005 (the date of adoption) under the modified prospective application. Under this application, the Company records stock-based compensation expense for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption and for the portion of previously granted awards that remained unvested at the date of adoption. Currently, the Companys stock-based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards as defined under SFAS No.123R.
Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company applied the provisions of APB No.25 as permitted under SFAS No.148. During the first half of fiscal 2005, which ended on August27, 2005, the Company recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards over the service period, but did not recognize compensation expense for stock options, since the Company historically has treated its stock options as having been granted at fair market value on the date of grant (however, see Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and Related Matters in Fiscal 2006 for a discussion of a special committee review of equity grant matters which resulted in, among other things, the use of revised measurement dates for certain grants).
The following table details the effect on net earnings and earnings per share as reported and as if compensation expense had been recorded through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2005 based on the fair value method under SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (pro forma).
The reported and pro forma net earnings and earnings per share for the years ended March1, 2008 and March3, 2007 are the same since stock-based compensation expense is calculated under the provisions of SFAS No.123R for those periods.
44 February25, (inthousands,exceptpersharedata) 2006 NET EARNINGS: As reported $ 572,847 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation   expense determined under fair value based method, net of related tax effects (31,415 ) Add: Total stock-based employee   compensation expense included in net earnings, net of related tax effects 16,008 Pro forma $ 557,440 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE: Basic: As reported $ 1.95 Pro forma $ 1.90 Diluted: As reported $ 1.92 Pro forma $ 1.87 Stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended March1, 2008 and March3, 2007 was approximately $43.8 million ($28.4 million after tax or $0.11 per diluted share) and approximately $82.6 million ($52.6 million after tax or $0.18 per diluted share), respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended March3, 2007, included expenses related to the cash payment of $30.0 million to remediate potential adverse tax consequences for Internal Revenue Code Section409A and approximately $8.2 million related to the revised measurement dates (See Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and Related Matters in Fiscal 2006 below). In addition, the amount of stock-based compensation cost capitalized for the year ended March1, 2008 and March3, 2007 was approximately $1.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
Incentive Compensation Plans The Company currently grants awards under the Bed Bath& Beyond 2004 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2004 Plan). The 2004 Plan is a flexible compensation plan that enables the Company to offer incentive compensation through stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights and performance awards, including cash awards. As a result, during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, awards consisting of a combination of stock options and performance-based restricted stock were granted to executive officers and other executives and awards consisting of restricted stock were granted to the Companys other employees who traditionally have received stock options. Awards of stock options and restricted stock generally vest in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant.
Prior to fiscal 2004, the Company had adopted various stock option plans (the Prior Plans), all of which solely provided for the granting of stock options. Upon adoption of the 2004 Plan, the common stock available under the Prior Plans became available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. No further option grants may be made under the Prior Plans, although outstanding awards under the Prior Plans will continue to be in effect.
Under the 2004 Plan and the Prior Plans, an aggregate of 83.4 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance. The Company generally issues new shares for stock option exercises and restricted stock awards. Under the 2004 Plan, grants are determined by the Compensation Committee for those awards granted to executive officers and by an appropriate committee for all other awards granted.
As of March1, 2008, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Companys stock 45 options and restricted stock awards, based on the Companys historical treatment of options and awards as having been granted at fair market value, was $48.4 million and $78.8 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years and 4.8 years, respectively (however, see Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and Related Matters in Fiscal 2006 for a discussion of a special committee review of equity grant matters which resulted in, among other things, the use of revised measurement dates for certain grants).
Stock Options The Company historically has treated its stock options as having been granted at fair market value on the date of grant (however, see Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and Related Matters in Fiscal 2006 for a discussion of a special committee review of equity grant matters which resulted in, among other things, the use of revised measurement dates for certain grants). The option grants generally become exercisable in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant. Option grants for stock options issued prior to May10, 2004 expire ten years after the date of grant. Option grants for stock options issued since May10, 2004 expire eight years after the date of grant. All option grants are non-qualified.
The fair value of the stock options granted was estimated on the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table.
FISCALYEARENDED March1, March3, February25, Black-ScholesValuationAssumptions(1) 2008 2007 2006 Weighted Average Expected Life (in years)   (2) 6.4 6.3 6.1 Weighted Average Expected Volatility (3) 25.00 % 25.00 % 25.00 % Weighted Average Risk Free Interest Rates   (4) 4.58 % 4.95 % 4.02 % Expected Dividend Yield    (1)Beginning on the date of adoption, forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience; prior to the date of adoption, forfeitures were recorded as they occurred.
(2)The expected life of stock options is estimated based on historical experience.
(3)The expected volatility is based solely on the implied volatility of the Companys call options. The Companys call options used to determine implied volatility are actively traded on multiple exchanges, had remaining maturities in excess of twelve months, had market prices close to the exercise prices of the employee stock options and were measured on the stock option grant date.
(4)Based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options.
Changes in the Companys stock options for the fiscal year ended March1, 2008 were as follows: Weighted Average Numberof Exercise (Sharesinthousands) StockOptions Price Options outstanding, beginning of year 19,836 $ 29.99 Granted 550 41.12 Exercised (1,463 ) 15.39 Forfeited or expired (541 ) 37.02 Options outstanding, end of year 18,382 $ 31.29 Options exercisable, end of year 12,189 $ 28.30 The weighted average fair value for the stock options granted in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $15.07, $14.24 46 and $12.71, respectively. The weighted average remaining contractual term and the aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding as of March1, 2008 was 4.0 years and $60.7 million, respectively. The weighted average remaining contractual term and the aggregate intrinsic value for options exercisable as of March1, 2008 was 3.5 years and $60.2 million, respectively. The total intrinsic values for stock options exercised during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $28.2 million, $58.8 million and $60.7 million, respectively.
Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options for fiscal 2007 were $22.7 million and the associated income tax benefits were $8.7 million.
Restricted Stock The Company historically has treated its restricted stock awards as having been issued and measured at fair market value on the date of grant (however, see Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and Related Matters in Fiscal 2006 for a discussion of a special committee review of equity grant matters which resulted in, among other things, the use of revised measurement dates for certain grants). The restricted stock awards generally become exercisable in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant.
Vesting of restricted stock awarded to certain of the Companys executives is dependent on the Companys achievement of a performance-based test for the fiscal year of grant, and assuming achievement of the performance-based test, time vesting, subject, in general, to the executive remaining in the Companys employ on specified vesting dates. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to these awards based on the assumption that the performance-based test will be achieved. Vesting of restricted stock awarded to the Companys other employees is based solely on time vesting.
Changes in the Companys restricted stock for the fiscal year ended March1, 2008 were as follows: Weighted Numberof Average Restricted Grant-Date (Sharesinthousands) Shares FairValue Unvested restricted stock, beginning of   year 1,931 $ 37.25 Granted 1,174 39.32 Vested (181 ) 37.85 Forfeited (158 ) 37.93 Unvested restricted stock, end of year 2,766 $ 38.05 Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and Related Matters in Fiscal 2006 In June2006, the Companys Board of Directors appointed a special committee of two independent members of the Board of Directors, with authority, among other things, to conduct an investigation with respect to the setting of exercise prices for employee stock options and related matters as the special committee deemed appropriate. The special committee retained independent legal counsel who engaged outside accounting advisors to assist with the review. This review was completed and on October9, 2006, the special committee presented its report to the Companys Board of Directors.
The review identified various deficiencies in the process of granting and documenting stock options and restricted shares. As a result of these deficiencies, the special committee recommended, among other things, revised measurement dates for certain stock option grants. The exercise price for most of these stock option grants was less than the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the revised measurement date.
As a result of these revised measurement dates, and the correction of various other errors, the Company determined that it had certain unrecorded non-cash equity-based compensation charges related to fiscal years prior to 2006. (See Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When 47 Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, Note 3).
The Companys Board of Directors also approved a remediation program intended to protect over 1,600 employees from certain potential adverse tax consequences. These adverse tax consequences arise pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section409A as a result of historical deficiencies associated with certain of the Companys stock option grants that were disclosed through the Companys stock option review. As a result of this program, the Company made cash payments totaling approximately $30.0 million to over 1,600 employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, which resulted in a non-recurring, pre-tax stock-based compensation charge. The cash outlay primarily represents payments to employees in connection with increasing the exercise prices on certain stock option grants so as to protect them from certain potential adverse tax consequences. No executive officer received such payments. The Company believes it is likely the Company will recoup a substantial portion of the anticipated cash outlay over the next several years through higher proceeds from future stock option exercises, although this recovery would not flow through the income statement.
The Company continues to cooperate with the informal inquiry of the SEC regarding the Companys stock option grant practices.
The United States Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey has concluded its inquiry with respect to matters arising out of and related to the Companys historical stock option grants and procedures and related matters and has indicated it will take no further action related to this matter.

48 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of March1, 2008 and March3, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended March1, 2008. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of March1, 2008 and March3, 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended March1, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.109, effective March4, 2007. Further, as discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans  An Amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 88, 106, and 132(R), as well as changed their method for quantifying errors based on SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements in 2006.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March1, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated April29, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
/s/ KPMG LLP Short Hills, New Jersey April29, 2008 49 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Shareholders Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.: We have audited Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of March1, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, appearing in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March1, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of March1, 2008 and March3, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity and cash flows and the related financial statement schedule for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended March1, 2008, and our report dated April29, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and the related financial statement schedule.

(d)Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended March1, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide such reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the Companys Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.
