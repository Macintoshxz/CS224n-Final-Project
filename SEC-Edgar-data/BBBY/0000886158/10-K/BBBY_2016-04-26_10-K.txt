Exhibits,   Financial Statement Schedules 2 Table of Contents PART I Unless otherwise indicated, the term Company refers collectively to Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 2, 2013. The Companys fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest February 28. Accordingly, fiscal 2012 represented 53 weeks and ended on March 2, 2013. Fiscal 2011 and 2010 represented 52 weeks and ended on February 25, 2012 and February 26, 2011, respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to periods of time (e.g., quarters and years) are to fiscal periods.
ITEM 1  BUSINESS Introduction Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) operates a chain of 1,471 retail stores under the names Bed Bath & Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops or andThat! (collectively, CTS), Harmon or Harmon Face Values (collectively, Harmon), buybuy BABY and World Market or Cost Plus World Market (collectively, World Market). The Company includes Linen Holdings, a distributor of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods to institutional customers in the hospitality, cruise line, food service, healthcare and other industries. Additionally, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates three retail stores in Mexico under the name Bed Bath & Beyond.
The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings include categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings, consumables and certain juvenile products. The Company offers a breadth and depth of selection in most of its product categories that exceeds what is generally available in department stores or other specialty retail stores.
History The Company was founded in 1971 by Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg, the Co-Chairmen of the Company. Each has more than 50 years of experience in the retail industry.
The Company commenced operations in 1971 with the opening of two stores, which primarily sold bed linens and bath accessories. In 1985, the Company introduced its first store carrying a full line of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. The Company began using the name Bed Bath & Beyond in 1987 in order to reflect the expanded product line offered by its stores and to distinguish its stores from conventional specialty retail stores offering only domestics merchandise or home furnishings. In 2002, the Company acquired Harmon, a health and beauty care retailer, which operated 27 stores at the time located in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. In 2003, the Company acquired CTS, a retailer of giftware and household items, which operated 23 stores at the time located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island. In 2007, the Company acquired buybuy BABY, a retailer of infant and toddler merchandise, which operated 8 stores at the time located in Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia. In 2007, the Company opened its first international BBB store in Ontario, Canada. In 2008, the Company became a partner in a joint venture which operated two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More, which were rebranded as Bed Bath & Beyond in fiscal 2012. In June 2012, the Company acquired Linen Holdings, LLC (Linen Holdings), a distributor of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods to institutional customers in the hospitality, cruise line, food service, healthcare and other industries, and Cost Plus, Inc. (World Market), a retailer selling a wide range of home decorating items, furniture, gifts, holiday and other seasonal items, and specialty food and beverages, which operated 258 stores in 30 states at the time of acquisition under the names of World Market or Cost Plus World Market.
The Company accounts for its operations as two operating segments: North American Retail and Institutional Sales. The Institutional Sales operating segment, which is comprised of Linen Holdings, does not meet the quantitative thresholds under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and therefore is not a reportable segment.
3 Table of Contents Total net sales of the Company were $10.915 billion, $9.500 billion and $8.759 billion for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net sales outside of the U.S. were not material for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. Refer to Part II, Item 7 and Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional financial information.
Operations It is the Companys goal to offer quality merchandise at everyday low prices; to maintain a wide assortment of merchandise; to present merchandise in a distinctive manner designed to maximize customer convenience and reinforce customer perception of wide selection; and to emphasize dedication to customer service and satisfaction.
Pricing.
The Company believes in maintaining everyday low prices. The Company regularly monitors price levels at its competitors in order to ensure that its prices are in accordance with its pricing philosophy. The Company believes that the application of its everyday low price philosophy is an important factor in establishing its reputation among customers.
Merchandise Assortment.
The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings include categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings, consumables and certain juvenile products. The Company strives to tailor the merchandise mix as appropriate to respond to changing trends and conditions. The factors taken into account in selecting the merchandise mix for a particular store include store size, configuration and local market conditions, such as climate and demographics. The Company, on an ongoing basis, tests new merchandise categories and adjusts the categories of merchandise carried in its stores and may add new departments or adjust the size of existing departments as required. Additionally, the Company continues to integrate the merchandise assortments among its concepts. The Company believes that the process of adding new departments, integrating the Companys merchandise within concepts, and expanding or reducing the size of various departments in response to changing conditions is an important part of its merchandising strategy.
Merchandise Presentation.
The Company has developed a style of merchandise presentation where all of its stores have groups of related product lines presented together in separate areas of each store. The Company believes that this format of merchandise presentation makes it easy for customers to locate products, reinforces customer perception of wide selection and communicates to customers that its stores offer a level of customer service generally associated with smaller specialty stores.
The Company believes that its extensive merchandise selection, rather than fixturing, should be the focus of customer attention and, accordingly, primarily uses simple modular fixturing throughout its stores. This fixturing is primarily designed so that it can be easily reconfigured to adapt to changes in the stores merchandise mix and presentation. The Company believes that its merchandise displays create an exciting and attractive shopping environment that encourages impulse purchases of additional items.
Advertising.
In general, the Company relies on word of mouth advertising, its reputation for offering a wide assortment of quality merchandise at everyday low prices and the use of paid advertising. Primary vehicles of paid advertising used by the Company include full-color circulars and other advertising pieces distributed via direct mail or inserts, as well as digital media including email, mobile, social and search advertising. Also, to support the opening of new stores, the Company primarily uses grand opening newspaper advertising and email.
Customer Service.
The Company places a strong focus on customer service and seeks to make shopping at its stores as pleasant and convenient as possible. Most stores are open seven days and six evenings a week in order to enable customers to shop at times that are convenient for them. In addition, the Companys websites, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, www.christmastreeshops.com, www.harmondiscount.com, www.facevalues.com, www.buybuybaby.com, www.bedbathandbeyond.ca and www.worldmarket.com as well as the Companys Facebook pages are available for customers to access 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
4 Table of Contents Suppliers In fiscal 2012, the Company purchased its merchandise from approximately 7,800 suppliers with the Companys largest supplier accounting for approximately 5% of the Companys merchandise purchases and the Companys 10 largest suppliers accounting for approximately 18% of such purchases. The Company purchases substantially all of its merchandise in the United States, the majority from domestic sources and the balance from importers. The Company purchases a small amount of its merchandise directly from overseas sources. The Company has no long term contracts for the purchase of merchandise. The Company believes that most merchandise, other than brand name goods, is available from a variety of sources and that most brand name goods can be replaced with comparable merchandise.
Distribution of Merchandise A substantial portion of the Companys merchandise is shipped to stores or customers through its supply chain network, which includes distribution facilities which are either owned or leased by the Company or managed by third parties, with the remaining merchandise shipped to stores or customers directly from a vendor. The Company utilizes 15 distribution facilities totaling approximately 6.0 million square feet. In addition, the Company maintains a number of supplemental storage locations to either enhance the warehouse facilities in the Companys stores in proximity to these locations or to fulfill orders for customers.
Employees As of March 2, 2013, the Company employed approximately 57,000 persons in full-time and part-time positions. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are very good and that the labor turnover rate among its management employees is lower than that generally experienced within the industry.
Seasonality The Companys sales exhibit seasonality with sales levels generally higher in the calendar months of August, November and December, and generally lower in February.
Expansion Program The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets, the expansion or relocation of existing stores and the continuous review of strategic acquisitions. In the 21 year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2012, the Company has grown from 34 stores to 1,471 stores, including the 258 World Market stores acquired on June 29, 2012. The Companys 1,471 stores operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, including: 1,004 BBB stores operating in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 74 CTS stores operating in 22 states; 47 Harmon stores operating in four states; 82 buybuy BABY stores operating in 29 states; and 264 World Market stores operating in 31 states and the District of Columbia. Total square footage grew from approximately 0.9 million square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to approximately 42.0 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2012, including the 264 World Market stores. During fiscal 2012, the Company opened a total of 41 new stores, including 12 BBB stores throughout the United States and Canada and three CTS stores, two Harmon stores, 18 buybuy BABY stores and six World Market stores throughout the United States and closed one BBB store, all of which resulted in the aggregate addition of approximately 5.9 million square feet of store space, including approximately 4.8 million square feet of store space for the 258 World Market stores acquired on June 29, 2012. Additionally, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which opened one store during fiscal 2012 and as of March 2, 2013, operated a total of three retail stores in Mexico under the name Bed Bath & Beyond.
The Company intends to continue its expansion program and believes that the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, on the success of this program. As part of its expansion program, the Company expects to open new stores and expand existing stores as opportunities arise. The Company believes throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 BBB stores as well as grow World Market, CTS and buybuy BABY from coast to coast.
5 Table of Contents In determining where to open new stores, the Company evaluates a number of factors, including the availability of real estate, demographic information (such as data relating to income and education levels, age and occupation) and distribution. The Company has built its management structure with a view toward its expansion and believes that, as a result, it has the management depth necessary to support its anticipated expansion program.
During fiscal 2012, the Company acquired Linen Holdings and World Market.
Competition The Company operates in the fragmented and highly competitive retail industry. The Company competes with many different types of retail stores that sell many or most of the same products. Such competitors include but are not limited to: (i) department stores, which often carry many of the same product lines as the Companys stores but do not typically have the same depth or breadth of product selection, (ii) specialty stores, which often have a depth of product selection but typically carry only a limited portion of the product lines carried by the Companys stores, (iii) discount and mass merchandise stores, (iv) national chains and (v) online and multi-channel retailers. In addition, the Companys stores compete, to a more limited extent, with factory outlet stores that typically offer limited quantities or limited lines of quality merchandise at discount prices. Other entities continue to introduce new concepts that include many of the product lines carried by the Companys stores. There can be no assurance that the operation of competitors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Tradenames and Service Marks The Company uses the service marks Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Christmas Tree Shops, andThat!, Harmon, Face Values, Cost Plus, World Market and Cost Plus World Market in connection with its retail services. The Company has registered trademarks and service marks or is seeking registrations for these and other trademarks and service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company also has registered or has applications pending with the trademark registries of several foreign countries, including having registered the Bed Bath & Beyond name and logo in Canada and Mexico. The Company also files patent applications and seeks copyright registrations where it deems such to be advantageous to the business. Management believes that its name recognition and service marks are important elements of the Companys merchandising strategy.

ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. Such factors include the following: General economic factors beyond the Companys control and changes in the economic climate could adversely affect the Companys performance.
General economic factors that are beyond the Companys control impact the Companys forecasts and actual performance. These factors include housing markets, recession, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, fuel and energy costs, interest rates, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, the impact of natural disasters, civil disturbances and terrorist activities, conditions affecting the retail environment for the home and other matters that influence consumer spending. Changes in the economic climate could adversely affect the Companys performance.
7 Table of Contents The Company operates in the highly competitive retail business where the use of emerging technologies as well as unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of competitors may adversely affect the Companys performance.
The retail business is highly competitive. The Company competes for customers, employees, locations, merchandise, technology, services and other important aspects of the business with many other local, regional and national retailers. Those competitors range from specialty retail stores to department stores and discounters as well as online and multi-channel retailers. Specifically, rapidly evolving technologies are altering the manner in which the Company and its competitors communicate and transact with customers, and the Companys own omni channel strategy to adapt to these changes in relation to its competitors actions in doing so presents a specific risk. Further, unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of the Companys competitors, including promotional activity, may adversely affect the Companys performance.
The Companys failure to anticipate and respond in a timely fashion to changes in consumer preferences and demographic factors could have a material adverse affect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.
The Companys success depends on its ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing merchandise trends, customer demands and demographics. The Companys failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in customer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could lead to, among other things, excess inventories or a shortage of products and could have a material adverse affect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.
Unusual weather patterns could adversely affect the Companys performance.
The Companys operating results could be negatively impacted by unusual weather patterns. Frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms, hurricanes, floods, tornados or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect the Companys performance.
A major disruption of the Companys information technology systems could negatively impact operating results.
The Companys operating results could be negatively impacted by a major disruption of the Companys information technology systems. The Company relies heavily on these systems to process transactions, manage inventory replenishment, summarize results and control distribution of products. Despite numerous safeguards and careful contingency planning, these systems are still subject to power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, security breaches and other catastrophic events. A major disruption of the systems and their backup mechanisms may cause the Company to incur significant costs to repair the systems, experience a critical loss of data and result in business interruptions.
A privacy breach of the Companys data security systems or those of its third party service providers could have a negative impact on the Companys operating results and financial performance due to possible loss of consumer confidence, as well as potential government penalties and private litigation.
The Company stores certain information about its customers and employees in the ordinary course of business. The Company invests considerable resources in protecting this sensitive information but is still subject to a possible security event. A breach of its security systems or those of its third party service providers resulting in unauthorized access to stored personal information could negatively impact the Companys operating results and financial performance. Certain aspects of the business, particularly the Company website, heavily depend on consumers entrusting personal financial information to be transmitted securely over public networks. A loss of consumer confidence could result in lost future sales and have a material adverse effect on the Companys reputation. In addition, a privacy breach could cause the Company to incur significant costs to restore the integrity of its systems, and could result in significant costs in government penalties and private litigation.
8 Table of Contents A failure of the Companys suppliers to adhere to appropriate laws or standards could negatively impact its reputation.
The Company purchases substantially all of its merchandise in the United States, the majority from domestic sources and the balance from importers. The Company purchases a small amount of its merchandise directly from overseas sources. The failure of one of the Companys domestic or foreign suppliers to adhere to labor, environmental, health and safety laws and standards could negatively impact the Companys reputation and have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.
Changes in statutory, regulatory, and other legal requirements at a local, state and national level could potentially impact the Companys operating and financial results.
The Company is subject to numerous statutory, regulatory and legal requirements at a local, state and national level. The Companys operating results could be negatively impacted by developments in these areas due to the costs of compliance in addition to possible government penalties and litigation in the event of deemed noncompliance. Changes in the regulatory environment in the area of product safety, environmental protection, privacy and information security, wage and hour laws, among others, could potentially impact the Companys operations and financial results.
New, or developments in existing, litigation, claims or assessments could potentially impact the Companys operating and financial results.
The Company is involved in litigation, claims and assessments incidental to the Companys business, the disposition of which is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Companys assumptions related to these matters. While outcomes of such actions vary, any such claim or assessment against the Company could potentially impact the Companys operations and financial results.
Changes to accounting rules, regulations and tax laws, or new interpretations of existing accounting standards or tax laws could negatively impact the Companys operating results and financial position.
The Companys operating results and financial position could be negatively impacted by changes to accounting rules and regulations or new interpretations of existing accounting standards. These changes may include, without limitation, changes to lease accounting standards. The Companys effective income tax rate could be impacted by changes in accounting standards as well as changes in tax laws or the interpretations of these tax laws by courts and taxing authorities which could negatively impact the Companys financial results.
The success of the Company is dependent, in part, on managing costs of labor, merchandise and other expenses that are subject to factors beyond the Companys control.
The Companys success depends, in part, on its ability to manage operating costs and to look for opportunities to reduce costs. The Companys ability to meet its labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, labor organizing activities and changing demographics. The Companys ability to find qualified vendors and obtain access to products in a timely and efficient manner can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, transportation costs and other factors beyond the Companys control.
The Company depends upon its employees in all areas of the organization to execute its business plan and, ultimately, to satisfy its customers.
The Companys ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of the organization may be affected by a number of factors, including geographic relocation of employees, operations or facilities and the highly competitive markets in which the Company operates, including the markets for the types of skilled individuals needed to support the Companys continued growth domestically, interactively and, over the longer term, internationally.
9 Table of Contents The Companys growth depends, in part, on its ability to open new stores, execute its interactive strategies and operate profitably.
The Companys growth depends, in part, on its ability to open new stores, execute its interactive strategies and operate profitably. The Companys ability to open additional stores successfully will depend on a number of factors, including its identification and availability of suitable store locations; its success in negotiating leases on acceptable terms; its hiring and training of skilled store operating personnel, especially management; and its timely development of new stores, including the availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction and other delays in store openings based on weather or other events. This increases the cost of doing business and the risk that the Companys business practices could result in liabilities that may adversely affect its performance, despite the exercise of reasonable care.
The continued uncertainty in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on the Companys ability to access its cash and cash equivalents.
The Company may have amounts of cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. While the Company closely manages its cash and cash equivalents balances to minimize risk, with the current financial environment and instability of financial institutions, the Company can not be assured that it will not experience losses on its deposits.
The Company has acquired several businesses and continues to evaluate potential business initiatives, including acquisitions, any of which could adversely impact the Companys performance.
The Company believes it carefully evaluates and plans for the integration of newly acquired businesses, as well as carefully prepares for and executes on other business combinations and strategic initiatives that are part of the growth of its business. However, such activities involve certain inherent risks, including the failure to retain key personnel from an acquired business; undisclosed or subsequently arising liabilities; challenges in the successful integration of operations, aligning standards, policies and systems; and the potential diversion of management resources from existing operations to respond to unforeseen issues arising in the context of the integration of a new business or initiative.

The Companys 1,471 stores are located in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada and range in size from approximately 5,000 to 100,000 square feet, but are predominantly between 18,000 and 50,000 square feet. Approximately 85% to 90% of store space is used for selling areas and the balance for warehouse, receiving and office space.
The table below sets forth the locations of the Companys stores as of March 2, 2013: Alabama 21 Alaska 2 Arizona 43 Arkansas 7 California 187 Colorado 33 Connecticut 23 Delaware 4 Florida 97 Georgia 37 Hawaii 1 Idaho 9 Illinois 58 Indiana 24 Iowa 10 Kansas 11 Kentucky 10 Louisiana 19 Maine 8 Maryland 21 Massachusetts 43 Michigan 43 Minnesota 14 Mississippi 7 Missouri 22 Montana 8 Nebraska 5 Nevada 13 New Hampshire 14 New Jersey 84 New Mexico 8 New York 92 North Carolina 43 North Dakota 2 Ohio 50 Oklahoma 8 Oregon 17 Pennsylvania 42 Rhode Island 5 South Carolina 24 South Dakota 3 Tennessee 27 Texas 114 Utah 15 Vermont 3 Virginia 44 Washington 36 West Virginia 3 Wisconsin 15 Wyoming 2 District of Columbia 3 Puerto Rico 3 Alberta, Canada 8 British Columbia, Canada 7 New Brunswick, Canada 2 Newfoundland, Canada 1 Novia Scotia, Canada 1 Ontario, Canada 14 Prince Edward Island, Canada 1 Total 1,471 The Company leases primarily all of its existing stores. The leases provide for original lease terms that generally range from 10 to 15 years and most leases provide for renewal options, often at increased rents. The Company evaluates leases on an ongoing basis which may lead to renegotiated lease terms, including rents during renewal options, or the possible relocation of stores. Certain leases provide for scheduled rent increases (which, in the case of fixed increases, the Company accounts for on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term, beginning when the Company obtains possession of the premises) and/or for contingent rent (based upon store sales exceeding stipulated amounts).

15 Table of Contents ITEM 7  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) operates a chain of 1,471 retail stores under the names Bed Bath & Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops or andThat! (collectively, CTS), Harmon or Harmon Face Values (collectively, Harmon), buybuy BABY and World Market or Cost Plus World Market (collectively, World Market). The Company includes Linen Holdings, a distributor of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods to institutional customers in the hospitality, cruise line, food service, healthcare and other industries. (See Acquisitions, Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for the acquisitions of World Market and Linen Holdings). Additionally, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates three retail stores in Mexico under the name Bed Bath & Beyond. The Company accounts for its operations as two operating segments: North American Retail and Institutional Sales. The Institutional Sales operating segment, which is comprised of Linen Holdings, does not meet the quantitative thresholds under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and therefore is not a reportable segment.
The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings include categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings, consumables and certain juvenile products. The Companys objective is to be a customers first choice for products and services in the categories offered, in the markets in which the Company operates.
The Companys strategy is to achieve this objective through excellent customer service, an extensive breadth, depth and differentiated assortment, everyday low prices and introduction of new merchandising offerings, supported by the continuous development and improvement of its infrastructure.
Operating in the highly competitive retail industry, the Company, along with other retail companies, is influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions including the housing market, relatively high unemployment and historically high commodity prices; the overall macroeconomic environment and related changes in the retailing environment; consumer preferences and spending habits; unusual weather patterns and natural disasters; competition from existing and potential competitors; evolving technology; and the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs and other terms to support the Companys expansion program. The Company cannot predict whether, when or the manner in which these factors could affect the Companys operating results.
The results of operations for the fiscal year ended March 2, 2013 include Linen Holdings since the date of acquisition on June 1, 2012 and World Market since the date of acquisition on June 29, 2012.
The following represents an overview of the Companys financial performance for the periods indicated:  Net sales in fiscal 2012 (fifty-three weeks) increased approximately 14.9% to $10.915 billion; net sales in fiscal 2011 (fifty-two weeks) increased approximately 8.5% to $9.500 billion over net sales of $8.759 billion in fiscal 2010 (fifty-two weeks).
Comparable store sales for fiscal 2012 increased by approximately 2.7% as compared with an increase of approximately 5.9% in fiscal 2011 and an increase of approximately 7.8% in fiscal 2010. Comparable store sales percentages are calculated based on an equivalent number of weeks in each annual period.
A store is considered a comparable store when it has been open for twelve full months following its grand opening period (typically four to six weeks). Stores relocated or expanded are excluded from comparable store sales if the change in square footage would cause meaningful disparity in sales over the prior period. In the case of a store to be closed, such stores sales are not considered comparable once the store closing process has commenced. Linen Holdings is excluded from the comparable store sales calculations and will continue to be excluded on an ongoing basis as long as it does not meet the above definition of comparable store sales. World Market is excluded from the comparable store sales calculations for fiscal 2012, and will continue to be excluded from the comparable store sales calculations until after the anniversary of the acquisition.
16 Table of Contents  Gross profit for fiscal 2012 was $4.389 billion or 40.2% of net sales compared with $3.931 billion or 41.4% of net sales for fiscal 2011 and $3.623 billion or 41.4% of net sales for fiscal 2010.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for fiscal 2012 were $2.751 billion or 25.2% of net sales compared with $2.363 billion or 24.9% of net sales for fiscal 2011 and $2.334 billion or 26.7% of net sales for fiscal 2010.
The effective tax rate was 36.5%, 37.0% and 38.8% for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The tax rate included discrete tax items of an approximate $26.7 million net benefit, $20.7 million net benefit and $0.9 million net expense, respectively, for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010.
For the fiscal year ended March 2, 2013 (fifty-three weeks), net earnings per diluted share were $4.56 ($1.038 billion), an increase of approximately 12%, as compared with net earnings per diluted share of $4.06 ($989.5 million) for fiscal 2011 (fifty-two weeks), which was an increase of approximately 32% from net earnings per diluted share of $3.07 ($791.3 million) for fiscal 2010 (fifty-two weeks). For the fiscal year ended March 2, 2013, the increase in net earnings per diluted share is the result of the items described above, which includes an estimated $0.05 benefit related to the fifty-third week in fiscal year 2012 and the impact of the Companys repurchases of its common stock. For the fiscal year ended February 25, 2012, the increase in net earnings per diluted share is the result of the items described above and the impact of the Companys repurchases of its common stock.
During fiscal 2012, the Company made progress in many areas, such as: the completion of the relocation of the Companys Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to its corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey; the ongoing integration of the two fiscal 2012 acquisitions; enhancing the omni channel experience for its customers by replacing both back end and customer facing systems; the opening of a new distribution facility in Georgia; increasing the investment in people and systems to upgrade the Companys data and analytics capabilities; and the commencement of the initial phase of a new information technology data center to enhance the Companys disaster recovery capabilities and support its overall information technology systems.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $314.7 million, $243.4 million and $183.5 million, respectively. The Company remains committed to making the required investments in its infrastructure to help position the Company for continued growth and success. The Company continues to review and prioritize its capital needs while continuing to make investments, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements, including omni channel capabilities, and other projects whose impact is considered important to its future.
During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company repurchased 16.1 million, 21.5 million and 15.9 million shares, respectively, of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $1.001 billion, $1.218 billion and $687.6 million, respectively.
The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to further its long term objectives. In fiscal 2013, the Company expects to open approximately 45 new stores with the possibility of some of these stores pushing into fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2012, the Company opened a total of 41 new stores and closed one store. Additionally, the Company acquired 258 World Market stores as of June 29, 2012.
17 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated (i) selected statement of earnings data of the Company expressed as a percentage of net sales and (ii) the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of earnings data: FiscalYearEnded Percentage PercentageChange ofNetSales fromPriorYear March2, February25, February26, March2, February25, 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 14.9 % 8.5 % Cost of sales 59.8 58.6 58.6 17.2 8.4 Gross profit 40.2 41.4 41.4 11.6 8.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 25.2 24.9 26.7 16.4 1.2 Operating profit 15.0 16.5 14.7 4.5 21.7 Earnings before provision for income taxes 15.0 16.5 14.8 4.1 21.4 Net earnings 9.5 10.4 9.0 4.9 25.0 Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2012 (fifty-three weeks) increased $1.415 billion to $10.915 billion, representing an increase of 14.9% over $9.500 billion of net sales in fiscal 2011 (fifty-two weeks), which increased $741.4 million or 8.5% over the $8.759 billion of net sales in fiscal 2010 (fifty-two weeks). For fiscal 2012, approximately 58% of the increase in net sales was attributable to the inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings since the date of each respective acquisition through the end of the fiscal fifty-second week, approximately 13% of the increase was attributable to the fifty-third week including World Market and Linen Holdings, approximately 18% was attributable to an increase in the Companys comparable store sales and the remaining 11% of the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales. For fiscal 2011, approximately 68.6% of the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in the Companys comparable store sales and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales.
For fiscal 2012, comparable store sales for 1,122 stores represented $9.820 billion of net sales; for fiscal 2011, comparable store sales for 1,076 stores represented $9.157 billion of net sales; and for fiscal 2010, comparable store sales for 1,013 stores represented $8.339 billion of net sales. The number of stores includes only those which constituted a comparable store for the entire respective fiscal period. The increase in comparable store sales, which excludes World Market and Linen Holdings, was approximately 2.7% for fiscal 2012, as compared with an increase of approximately 5.9% for fiscal 2011. The increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2012 was due to an increase in the average transaction amount partially offset by a decrease in the number of transactions. The increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2011 was due to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount. Comparable store sales percentages are calculated based on an equivalent number of weeks for each annual period.
Sales of domestics merchandise accounted for approximately 39%, 40% and 41% of net sales in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of which the Company estimates that bed linens accounted for approximately 12% of net sales in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The remaining net sales in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 of 61%, 60% and 59%, respectively, represented sales of home furnishings. No other individual product category accounted for 10% or more of net sales during fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010.
18 Table of Contents Gross Profit Gross profit in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $4.389 billion or 40.2% of net sales, $3.931 billion or 41.4% of net sales and $3.623 billion or 41.4% of net sales, respectively. The decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales between fiscal 2012 and 2011 was primarily attributed to an increase in coupons, due to increases in both the redemption and the average coupon amount, and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2011 included a reduction in markdowns, offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A was $2.751 billion or 25.2% of net sales in fiscal 2012, $2.363 billion or 24.9% of net sales in fiscal 2011 and $2.334 billion or 26.7% of net sales in fiscal 2010. The increase in SG&A between fiscal 2012 and 2011 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a relative increase in advertising expenses. As a percentage of net sales, the relative increase in advertising expenses was higher due to the inclusion of the financial results of the acquisitions completed in fiscal 2012. In addition, the fifty-third week has relatively higher SG&A than the year to date fifty-two weeks and increased SG&A by approximately 10 basis points. The decrease in SG&A between fiscal 2011 and 2010 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to relative decreases in payroll and payroll-related items (including salaries and medical insurance), occupancy (including rent and depreciation), advertising and store expenses, all of which benefited from the increase in comparable store sales. In addition, advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces.
Operating Profit Operating profit for fiscal 2012 was $1.638 billion or 15.0% of net sales, $1.568 billion or 16.5% of net sales in fiscal 2011 and $1.288 billion or 14.7% of net sales in fiscal 2010. The change in operating profit as a percentage of net sales between fiscal 2012 and 2011 was the result of the changes in gross profit margin and SG&A as a percentage of net sales as described above. The change in operating profit as a percentage of net sales between fiscal 2011 and 2010 was the result of the change in SG&A as a percentage of net sales as described above.
Interest (Expense) Income Interest expense was $4.2 million in fiscal 2012 and interest income was $1.1 million and $4.5 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest expense for fiscal 2012 increased primarily due to the inclusion of interest expense related to the sale/leaseback obligations on the distribution facilities acquired as part of the fiscal 2012 acquisitions.
Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 36.5% for fiscal 2012, 37.0% for fiscal 2011 and 38.8% for fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2012, the tax rate included an approximate $26.7 million net benefit primarily due to the recognition of favorable discrete state tax items. For fiscal 2011, the tax rate included an approximate $20.7 million net benefit primarily due to the settlement of certain discrete tax items from on-going examinations, the recognition of favorable discrete state tax items and from changing the blended state tax rate of deferred income taxes. For fiscal 2010, the tax rate included an approximate $0.9 million net expense primarily due to the recognition of certain discrete tax items, partially offset by the changing of the blended state tax rate of deferred income taxes.
The Company expects continued volatility in the effective tax rate from year to year because the Company is required each year to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit.
19 Table of Contents EXPANSION PROGRAM The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets, the expansion or relocation of existing stores and the continuous review of strategic acquisitions. In the 21-year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2012, the chain has grown from 34 to 1,471 stores, including the 264 World Market stores (258 stores were acquired on June 29, 2012). Total square footage grew from approximately 0.9 million square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to approximately 42.0 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2012, including the 264 World Market stores. During fiscal 2012, the Company opened a total of 41 new stores and closed one store, all of which resulted in the aggregate addition of approximately 5.9 million square feet of store space, including approximately 4.8 million square feet of store space for the 258 World Market stores acquired on June 29, 2012. Additionally, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which opened one store during fiscal 2012 and as of March 2, 2013, operated a total of three retail stores in Mexico under the name Bed Bath & Beyond.
During fiscal 2012, the Company acquired Linen Holdings and World Market.
The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long term objectives. In fiscal 2013, the Company expects to open approximately 45 new stores with the possibility of some of these stores pushing into fiscal 2014. The continued growth of the Company is dependent, in part, upon the Companys ability to execute its expansion program successfully. During fiscal 2012, the Company completed the relocation of its Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to its corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey, which the Company believes improves the communication, collaboration, coordination and execution across all concepts, activities and platforms.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company has been able to finance its operations, including its expansion program, entirely through internally generated funds. For fiscal 2013, the Company believes that it can continue to finance its operations, including its expansion program, share repurchase program and planned capital expenditures, entirely through existing and internally generated funds. The Company periodically reviews its alternatives with respect to optimizing its capital structure. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2013, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements, including omni channel capabilities, and other projects are planned to be approximately $350.0 million, subject to the timing and composition of the projects. Some of the initiatives included in capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 are: enhancing the omni channel experience for its customers through replacing both back end and customer facing systems, upgrading the Companys mobile sites and applications, enhancing network communications in the stores and implementing point of sale improvements; building, equipping and staffing a new information technology data center to enhance disaster recovery capabilities and to support the Companys ongoing technology initiatives; and retrofitting energy saving equipment in the stores.
Fiscal 2012 compared to Fiscal 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012 was $1.193 billion, compared with $1.225 billion in fiscal 2011. Year over year, the Company experienced an increase in cash used by the net components of working capital (primarily merchandise inventories, other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by accounts payable and income taxes payable) and an increase in net earnings.
Retail inventory at cost per square foot was $58.12 as of March 2, 2013, as compared to $57.35 as of February 25, 2012.
Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2012 was $665.8 million, compared with $364.0 million in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, net cash used in investing activities was due to payments of $643.1 million related to the World Market and Linen Holdings acquisitions, $314.7 million for capital expenditures and $40.0 million for the acquisition of trademarks, partially offset by redemptions of $332.0 million of investment securities, net of purchases. In fiscal 2011, net cash used in investing activities was due to $243.4 million of capital expenditures and $120.6 million of purchases of investment securities, net of redemptions.
20 Table of Contents Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2012 was $965.4 million, compared with $1.042 billion in fiscal 2011. The decrease in net cash used was primarily due to a decrease in common stock repurchases of $216.7 million, partially offset by a $114.7 million decrease in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a $25.5 million payment for a credit facility assumed in acquisition.
Fiscal 2011 compared to Fiscal 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was $1.225 billion, compared with $987.4 million in fiscal 2010. Year-over-year, the Company experienced an increase in net earnings, partially offset by an increase in cash used for the net components of working capital (primarily accounts payable and income taxes payable, partially offset by merchandise inventories).
Inventory per square foot was $57.35 as of February 25, 2012, as compared to $56.17 as of February 26, 2011.
Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2011 was $364.0 million, compared with $341.0 million in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, net cash used in investing activities was due to $243.4 million of capital expenditures and $120.6 million of purchases of investment securities, net of redemptions. In fiscal 2010, net cash used in investing activities was due to $157.5 million of purchases of investment securities, net of redemptions, and $183.5 million of capital expenditures.
Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2011 was $1.042 billion, compared with $559.0 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in net cash used was primarily due to a $530.4 million increase in common stock repurchases partially offset by a $45.4 million increase in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
Auction Rate Securities As of March 2, 2013, the Company held approximately $49.0 million of net investments in auction rate securities. Beginning in mid-February 2008, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities failed and continues to fail. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. All of these investments carry triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies. As of March 2, 2013, these securities had a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2.0 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed to be temporary, it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Companys net earnings for fiscal 2012.
During fiscal 2012, approximately $8.5 million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par and approximately $24.3 million were tendered at a price of approximately 95% of par value, for which the Company incurred a realized loss of approximately $1.1 million included within interest (expense) income, net in the consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal 2012. Prior to these tenders, all redemptions of these securities had been at par. The Company will continue to monitor the market for these securities and will expense any permanent changes to the value of the remaining securities, if any, as they occur.
The Company does not anticipate that any continuing lack of liquidity in its auction rate securities will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program, share repurchase program, and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments. These investments will remain primarily classified as non-current assets until the Company has better visibility as to when their liquidity will be restored. The classification and valuation of these securities will continue to be reviewed quarterly.
21 Table of Contents Other Fiscal 2012 Information At March 2, 2013, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million each, with expiration dates of September 1, 2013 and February 28, 2014, respectively. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently and are expected to be used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. During fiscal 2012, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of March 2, 2013, there was approximately $11.6 million of outstanding letters of credit. Although no assurances can be provided, the Company intends to renew both uncommitted lines of credit before the respective expiration dates. In addition, as of March 2, 2013, the Company maintained unsecured standby letters of credit of $76.2 million, primarily for certain insurance programs.
Between December 2004 and December 2012, the Companys Board of Directors authorized, through share repurchase programs, the repurchase of $7.450 billion of the Companys common stock.
Since 2004 through the end of fiscal 2012, the Company has repurchased approximately $5.0 billion of its common stock through share repurchase programs. The Company has approximately $2.4 billion remaining of authorized share repurchases as of March 2, 2013. The execution of the Companys share repurchase program will consider current business and market conditions.
The Company has authorization to make repurchases from time to time in the open market or through other parameters approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to existing rules and regulations.
The Company has contractual obligations consisting mainly of operating leases for stores, offices, distribution facilities and equipment, purchase obligations, long-term sale/leaseback and capital lease obligations and other long-term liabilities which the Company is obligated to pay as of March 2, 2013 as follows: (inthousands) Total Lessthan1 year 1-3years 4-5years After5 years Operating Lease Obligations (1) $ 3,353,145 $ 561,104 $ 971,468 $ 727,632 $ 1,092,941 Purchase Obligations (2) 969,151 969,151    Long-term sale/leaseback and capital lease   obligations(3) 352,262 9,877 19,689 19,921 302,775 Other long-term liabilities (4) 456,648     Total Contractual Obligations $ 5,131,206 $ 1,540,132 $ 991,157 $ 747,553 $ 1,395,716 (1) The amounts presented represent the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases. In addition to minimum rent, certain of the Companys leases require the payment of additional costs for insurance, maintenance and other costs. These additional amounts are not included in the table of contractual commitments as the timing and/or amounts of such payments are not known. As of March 2, 2013, the Company has leased sites for 31 locations planned for opening in fiscal 2013 or 2014, for which aggregate minimum rental payments over the term of the leases are approximately $140.1 million and are included in the table above.
(2) Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise.
(3) Long-term sale/leaseback and capital lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under the sale/leaseback agreements and capital lease agreements, acquired through the World Market acquisition.
(4) Other long-term liabilities are primarily comprised of income taxes payable, deferred rent, workers compensation and general liability reserves and various other accruals and are recorded as Deferred Rent and Other Liabilities and Income Taxes Payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 2, 2013. The amounts associated with these other long-term liabilities have been reflected only in the Total Column in the table above as the timing and/or amount of any cash payment is uncertain.
22 Table of Contents SEASONALITY The Companys sales exhibit seasonality with sales levels generally higher in the calendar months of August, November and December, and generally lower in February.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated accounting guidance related to testing goodwill for impairment. This guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. This guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company adopted this guidance. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In July 2012, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance related to testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. This guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the annual impairment analysis. This guidance is effective for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company adopted this guidance. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
INFLATION The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, accruals for self insurance, litigation, store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, stock-based compensation and income and certain other taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Inventory Valuation : Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs are primarily calculated using the weighted average retail inventory method.
Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail values of inventories. The cost associated with determining the cost-to-retail ratio includes: merchandise purchases, net of returns to vendors, discounts and volume and incentive rebates; inbound freight expenses; duty, insurance and commissions.
At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions.
23 Table of Contents The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory counts for locations at which counts were conducted. For locations where physical inventory counts were not conducted in the fiscal year, an estimated shrink reserve is recorded based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile.
The Company accrues for merchandise in transit once it takes legal ownership and title to the merchandise; as such, an estimate for merchandise in transit is included in the Companys merchandise inventories.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. The Company has not historically recorded any material impairment to its long-lived assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that a long-lived asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these long-lived assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets : The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. As of March 2, 2013, for goodwill related to the Institutional Sales operating segment and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets, the Company assessed qualitative factors in order to determine whether any events and circumstances existed which indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of these indefinite lived intangible assets did not exceed its carrying value and concluded no such events or circumstances existed which would require an impairment test being performed. Additionally, the Company completed its annual impairment testing related to goodwill for the North American Retail operating segment, which is the reporting unit, and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets, not considered in the qualitative analysis, and determined that, as of March 2, 2013, no impairment existed because the fair value of these assets substantially exceeded their carrying values. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs .
Self Insurance : The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
Litigation : The Company records an estimated liability related to its various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business when and to the extent that it concludes a liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such estimated loss is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to claims and legal actions and revises its estimated liabilities, as appropriate. The Company expects the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Company also cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings.
24 Table of Contents Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs : Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation: The Company uses a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options. The Black-Scholes model includes various assumptions, including the expected life of stock options, the expected risk free interest rate and the expected volatility. These assumptions reflect the Companys best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of the Company. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, total stock-based compensation cost could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if the Company uses different assumptions for future grants, stock-based compensation cost could be materially impacted in future periods.
The Company determines its assumptions for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in accordance with the accounting guidance related to stock compensation.
The expected life of stock options is estimated based on historical experience.
The expected risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options.
Expected volatility is based on the average of historical and implied volatility. The historical volatility is determined by observing actual prices of the Companys stock over a period commensurate with the expected life of the awards. The implied volatility represents the implied volatility of the Companys call options, which are actively traded on multiple exchanges, had remaining maturities in excess of twelve months, had market prices close to the exercise prices of the employee stock options and were measured on the stock option grant date.
The Company is required to record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. The Companys forfeiture rate assumption used in determining its stock-based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data. The actual forfeiture rate could differ from these estimates.
Taxes : The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of its Canadian subsidiary. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., in most cases such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.
The Company expects continued volatility in the effective tax rate from year to year because the Company is required each year to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit.
25 Table of Contents The Company also accrues for certain other taxes as required by their operations.
Judgment is required in determining the provision for income and other taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys various tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10-K and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. Such factors include, without limitation: general economic conditions including the housing market, a challenging overall macroeconomic environment and related changes in the retailing environment, consumer preferences and spending habits; demographics and other macroeconomic factors that may impact the level of spending for the types of merchandise sold by the Company; civil disturbances and terrorist attacks; unusual weather patterns and natural disasters; competition from existing and potential competitors; competition from other channels of distribution; pricing pressures; the ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of the organization; the cost of labor, merchandise and other costs and expenses; the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs and other terms to support the Companys expansion program; uncertainty in financial markets; disruptions to the Companys information technology systems including but not limited to security breaches of the Companys systems protecting consumer and employee information; reputational risk arising from the acts of third parties; changes to statutory, regulatory and legal requirements; new, or developments in existing, litigation, claims or assessments; changes to, or new, tax laws or interpretation of existing tax laws; changes to, or new, accounting standards including, without limitation, changes to lease accounting standards; and the integration of acquired businesses. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update its forward-looking statements.
ITEM 7A  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of March 2, 2013, the Companys investments include cash and cash equivalents of approximately $565.0 million, short term investment securities of approximately $449.9 million and long term investment securities of approximately $77.3 million at weighted average interest rates of 0.01%, 0.09% and 0.18%, respectively.
As of March 2, 2013, the Company held approximately $49.0 million of net investments in auction rate securities. Beginning in mid-February 2008, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities failed and continues to fail. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. All of these investments carry triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies. As of March 2, 2013, these securities had a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2.0 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed to be temporary, it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Companys net earnings for fiscal 2012.
During fiscal 2012, approximately $8.5 million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par and approximately $24.3 million were tendered at a price of approximately 95% of par value, for which the Company incurred a realized loss of approximately $1.1 million included within interest (expense) income, net in the consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal 2012. Prior to these tenders, all redemptions of these securities had been at par. The Company will continue to monitor the market for these securities and will expense any permanent changes to the value of the remaining securities, if any, as they occur.
26 Table of Contents The Company does not anticipate that any continuing lack of liquidity in its auction rate securities will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program, share repurchase program, and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments. These investments will remain primarily classified as non-current assets until the Company has better visibility as to when their liquidity will be restored. The classification and valuation of these securities will continue to be reviewed quarterly.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED MATTERS A.
Nature of Operations Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) operates a chain of retail stores under the names Bed Bath& Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops or andThat! (collectively, CTS), Harmon or Harmon Face Values (collectively, Harmon), buybuy BABY and World Market or Cost Plus World Market (collectively, World Market). The Company includes Linen Holdings, a distributor of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods to institutional customers in the hospitality, cruise line, food service, healthcare and other industries. Additionally, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates three retail stores in Mexico under the name Bed Bath& Beyond. The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings include categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings, consumables and certain juvenile products. As the Company operates in the retail industry, its results of operations are affected by general economic conditions and consumer spending habits.
The Company accounts for its operations as two operating segments: North American Retail and Institutional Sales. The Institutional Sales operating segment, which is comprised of Linen Holdings, does not meet the quantitative thresholds under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and therefore is not a reportable segment.
B.
Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest February28. Accordingly, fiscal 2012 represented 53 weeks and ended on March2, 2013; fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 represented 52 weeks and ended on February25, 2012 and February26, 2011, respectively.
C.
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company accounts for its investment in the joint venture under the equity method.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
D.
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of auction rate securities, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, accruals for self insurance, litigation, store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, the provision for sales returns, vendor allowances, stock-based compensation and income and certain other taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
E.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Included in cash and cash equivalents are credit and debit card receivables from banks, which typically settle within 5 business days, of $87.8 million and $67.1 million as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, respectively.
34 Table of Contents F.
Investment Securities Investment securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury Bills with remaining maturities of less than one year and auction rate securities, which are securities with interest rates that reset periodically through an auction process. The U.S. Treasury Bills are classified as short term held-to-maturity securities and are stated at their amortized cost which approximates fair value. Auction rate securities are classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, which had historically been consistent with cost or par value due to interest rates which reset periodically, typically every 7, 28 or 35 days. As a result, there generally were no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains or losses relating to these auction rate securities. However, beginning in mid-February2008 due to market conditions, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities failed and continues to fail. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities, and affect their estimated fair values at March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. (See Fair Value Measurements, Note 5 and Investment Securities, Note 6). All income from these investments is recorded as interest income.
Those investment securities which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments and are stated at amortized cost. Those investment securities which are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are stated at fair market value.
Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted over the life of the security as adjustments to interest income using the effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
G.
Inventory Valuation Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs are primarily calculated using the weighted average retail inventory method.
Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail values of inventories. The cost associated with determining the cost-to-retail ratio includes: merchandise purchases, net of returns to vendors, discounts and volume and incentive rebates; inbound freight expenses; duty, insurance and commissions.
At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions.
The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory counts for locations at which counts were conducted. For locations where physical inventory counts were not conducted in the fiscal year, an estimated shrink reserve is recorded based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile.
The Company accrues for merchandise in transit once it takes legal ownership and title to the merchandise; as such, an estimate for merchandise in transit is included in the Companys merchandise inventories.
H.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (forty years for buildings; five to twenty years for furniture, fixtures and equipment; and three to seven years for computer equipment and software). Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful life or the life of the lease. Depreciation expense is primarily included within selling, general and administrative expenses.
35 Table of Contents The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to earnings as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs amounted to $106.1 million, $85.8 million and $90.2 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
I.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. The Company has not historically recorded any material impairment to its long-lived assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that a long-lived asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these long-lived assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
J.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available, including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. As of March2, 2013, for goodwill related to the Institutional Sales operating segment and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets, the Company assessed qualitative factors in order to determine whether any events and circumstances existed which indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of these indefinite lived intangible assets did not exceed its carrying value and concluded no such events or circumstances existed which would require an impairment test being performed. Additionally, the Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill for the North American Retail operating segment, which is the reporting unit, and other indefinite lived intangible assets, not considered in the qualitative analysis, and determined that, as of March2, 2013, no impairment existed because the fair value of these assets substantially exceeded their carrying values. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Included within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012 are $291.4 million and $30.9 million, respectively, for indefinite lived tradenames and trademarks.
K.
Self Insurance The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
36 Table of Contents L.
Deferred Rent The Company accounts for scheduled rent increases contained in its leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease beginning as of the date the Company obtained possession of the leased premises. Deferred rent amounted to $80.2 million and $77.9 million as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, respectively.
Cash or lease incentives (tenant allowances) received pursuant to certain store leases are recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction to rent over the lease term. The unamortized portion of tenant allowances is included in deferred rent and other liabilities. The unamortized portion of tenant allowances amounted to $126.1 million and $120.1 million as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, respectively.
M.
Treasury Stock Between December2004 and December2012, the Companys Board of Directors authorized, through share repurchase programs, the repurchase of $7.450 billion of the Companys common stock.
During fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 16.1 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $1.001 billion. During fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 21.5 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $1.218 billion. During fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 15.9 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $687.6 million. The Company has approximately $2.4 billion remaining of authorized share repurchases as of March2, 2013.
The Company has authorization to make repurchases from time to time in the open market or through other parameters approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to existing rulesand regulations.
N.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, accounts payable and certain other liabilities. The Companys investment securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, which are stated at amortized cost, and auction rate securities, which are stated at their approximate fair value. The book value of all financial instruments is representative of their fair values (See Fair Value Measurements, Note 5).
O.
Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at the Companys retail stores or upon delivery for products purchased from its websites. The value of point-of-sale coupons and point-of-sale rebates that result in a reduction of the price paid by the customer are recorded as a reduction of sales. Shipping and handling fees that are billed to a customer in a sale transaction are recorded in sales. Taxes, such as sales tax, use tax and value added tax, are not included in sales.
Revenues from gift cards, gift certificates and merchandise credits are recognized when redeemed. Gift cards have no provisions for reduction in the value of unused card balances over defined time periods and have no expiration dates.
Sales returns are provided for in the period that the related sales are recorded based on historical experience. Although the estimate for sales returns has not varied materially from historical provisions, actual experience could vary from historical experience in the future if the level of sales return activity changes materially. In the future, if the Company concludes that an adjustment to the sales return accrual is required due to material changes in the returns activity, the reserve will be adjusted accordingly.
37 Table of Contents P.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise, buying costs and costs of the Companys distribution network including inbound freight charges, distribution facility costs, receiving costs, internal transfer costs and shipping and handling costs.
Q.
Vendor Allowances The Company receives allowances from vendors in the normal course of business for various reasons including direct cooperative advertising, purchase volume and reimbursement for other expenses. Annual terms for each allowance include the basis for earning the allowance and payment terms, which vary by agreement. All vendor allowances are recorded as a reduction of inventory cost, except for direct cooperative advertising allowances which are specific, incremental and identifiable. The Company recognizes purchase volume allowances as a reduction of the cost of inventory in the quarter in which milestones are achieved. Advertising costs were reduced by direct cooperative allowances of $19.8 million, $19.5 million and $17.6 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
R.
Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred.
S.
Advertising Costs Expenses associated with direct response advertising are expensed over the period during which the sales are expected to occur, generally four to seven weeks, and all other expenses associated with store advertising are charged to earnings as incurred. Net advertising costs amounted to $250.6 million, $192.5 million and $198.3 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
T.
Stock-Based Compensation The Company measures all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and records such expense in its consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted the accounting guidance related to stock compensation on August28, 2005 (the date of adoption) under the modified prospective application. Under this application, the Company records stock-based compensation expense for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption and for the portion of previously granted awards that remained unvested at the date of adoption. Currently, the Companys stock-based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards.
U. Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return. Income tax returns are also filed with each taxable jurisdiction in which the Company conducts business.
The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
38 Table of Contents The Company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of its Canadian subsidiary. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., in most cases such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.
Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
V. Earnings per Share The Company presents earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis. Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding including the dilutive effect of stock-based awards as calculated under the treasury stock method.
Stock-based awards of approximately 1.2 million, 0.9 million and 1.5 million shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
W.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated accounting guidance related to testing goodwill for impairment. This guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. This guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company adopted this guidance. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In July2012, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance related to testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. This guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the annual impairment analysis. This guidance is effective for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company adopted this guidance. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

As of March2, 2013, there was approximately $11.6 million of outstanding letters of credit. Although no assurances can be provided, the Company intends to renew both uncommitted lines of credit before the respective expiration dates. In addition, as of March2, 2013, the Company maintained unsecured standby letters of credit of $76.2 million, primarily for certain insurance programs. As of February25, 2012, there was approximately $8.5 million of outstanding letters of credit and approximately $61.3 million of outstanding unsecured standby letters of credit, primarily for certain insurance programs.
5.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches, including quoted market prices and discounted cash flows. The hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect a companys judgment concerning the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available under the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:  Level 1  Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the Company is able to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
Level 2  Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar, or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
41 Table of Contents  Level 3  Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
As of March2, 2013, the Companys financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputs include long term investment securities traded on active securities exchanges. The Company did not have any financial assets utilizing Level 2 inputs. Financial assets utilizing Level 3 inputs included long term investments in auction rate securities consisting of preferred shares of closed end municipal bond funds (See Investment Securities, Note 6).
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the Companys degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset or liability must be classified in its entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value.
Valuation techniques used by the Company must be consistent with at least one of the three possible approaches: the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach. The Companys Level 1 valuations are based on the market approach and consist primarily of quoted prices for identical items on active securities exchanges. The Companys Level 3 valuations of auction rate securities, which had temporary valuation adjustments of approximately $2.0 million and $3.7 million as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, respectively, are based on the income approach, specifically, discounted cash flow analyses which utilize significant inputs based on the Companys estimates and assumptions. As of March2, 2013, the inputs used in the Companys discounted cash flow analysis included current coupon rates of 0.18%, an estimated redemption period of 5 years and a discount rate of 0.99%. The discount rate was based on market rates for risk-free tax-exempt securities, as adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the lack of liquidity of these investments. Assuming a higher discount rate, a longer estimated redemption period and lower coupon rates would result in a lower fair market value. Conversely, assuming a lower discount rate, a shorter estimated redemption period and higher coupon rates would result in a higher fair market value.
The following tables present the valuation of the Companys financial assets as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, measured at fair value on a recurring basis by input level: AsofMarch2,2013 (inmillions) QuotedPrices inActive Marketsfor Identical Assets (Level1) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level3) Total Long term - available-for-sale securities: Auction rate securities $  $ 49.0 $ 49.0 Long term - trading securities: Nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets 28.3  28.3 Total $ 28.3 $ 49.0 $ 77.3 42 Table of Contents AsofFebruary25,2012 (inmillions) QuotedPrices (Level1) Significant (Level3) Total Short term - available-for-sale securities: Auction rate securities $  $ 6.5 $ 6.5 Long term - available-for-sale securities: Auction rate securities $  $ 73.7 $ 73.7 Long term - trading securities: Nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets 22.1  22.1 Total $ 22.1 $ 80.2 $ 102.3 The following table presents the changes in the Companys financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): (inmillions) AuctionRate Securities Balance on February25, 2012, net of   temporary valuation adjustment $ 80.2 Change in temporary valuation adjustment included   in accumulated other comprehensive loss 1.6 Realized loss included in   earnings (1) (1.1 ) Redemptions (31.7 ) Balance on March2, 2013, net of temporary   valuation adjustment $ 49.0 (1)None of the losses for the period that are included in earnings relate to assets still held on March2, 2013.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES The Companys investment securities as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012 are as follows: (inmillions) March2, 2013 February25, 2012 Available-for-sale securities: Short term $  $ 6.5 Long term 49.0 73.7 Trading securities: Long term 28.3 22.1 Held-to-maturity securities: Short term 449.9 749.9 Total investment securities $ 527.2 $ 852.2 Auction Rate Securities As of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, the Companys available-for-sale investment securities represented approximately $51.0 million and approximately $83.9 million par value of auction rate securities, respectively, less temporary valuation adjustments of approximately $2.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively. Since these valuation adjustments are deemed to be temporary, they are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Companys net earnings. These securities at par are invested in preferred shares of closed end municipal bond funds, which are required, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, to maintain minimum asset coverage ratios of 200%. All of these available-for-sale investments carried triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, and none of them are mortgage-backed debt obligations. As of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, the Companys available-for-sale investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more, however, the Company believes that the unrealized losses are temporary and reflect the investments current lack of liquidity. Due to their lack of liquidity, the Company classified approximately $49.0 million and $73.7 million of these investments as long term investment securities at March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, respectively. During fiscal 2012, approximately $8.5 million of these securities were redeemed at par and approximately $24.3 million were tendered at a price of approximately 95% of par value, for which the Company incurred a realized loss of approximately $1.1 million included within interest (expense) income, net in the consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal 2012.
43 Table of Contents U.S. Treasury Securities As of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, the Companys short term held-to-maturity securities included approximately $449.9 million and approximately $749.9 million, respectively, of U.S. Treasury Bills with remaining maturities of less than one year. These securities are stated at their amortized cost which approximates fair value, which is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments (i.e., Level 1 valuation).
Long Term Trading Investment Securities The Companys long term trading investment securities, which are provided as investment options to the participants of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, are stated at fair market value. The values of these trading investment securities included in the table above are approximately $28.3 million and $22.1 million as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, respectively.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows: FISCALYEARENDED (inthousands) March2, 2013 February25, 2012 February26, 2011 Current: Federal $ 522,812 $ 475,280 $ 426,956 State and local 55,889 74,438 90,689 578,701 549,718 517,645 Deferred: Federal 15,710 28,695 (7,698 ) State and local 1,860 1,538 (8,302 ) 17,570 30,233 (16,000 ) $ 596,271 $ 579,951 $ 501,645 At March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, included in other current assets is a net current deferred income tax asset of $212.7 million and $209.4 million, respectively, and included in other assets is a net noncurrent deferred income tax asset of $36.0 million and $43.7 million, respectively. These amounts represent the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following: 44 Table of Contents (inthousands) March2, 2013 February25, 2012 Deferred tax assets: Inventories $ 33,699 $ 33,058 Deferred rent and other rent credits 82,123 78,292 Insurance 55,070 53,607 Stock-based compensation 33,486 37,633 Merchandise credits and gift card liabilities 22,683 12,376 Accrued expenses 81,069 80,012 Obligations on distribution centers 42,024  Net operating loss carryforwards and other tax   credits 42,506  Other 57,129 47,422 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation (40,276 ) (25,510 ) Goodwill (42,719 ) (36,590 ) Intangibles (78,106 )  Other (39,957 ) (27,228 ) $ 248,731 $ 253,072 At March2, 2013, as a result of the World Market acquisition (See Acquisitions, Note 2), the Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of $22.3 million (tax effected), which will begin expiring in 2025, state net operating loss carryforwards of $9.3 million (tax effected), which will expire between 2012 and 2031, California state enterprise zone credit carryforwards of $9.9 million (tax effected), which have no expiration dates but require taxable income in the enterprise zone to be realizable and other tax credits of $1.0 million (tax effected).
The Company has not established a valuation allowance for the net deferred tax asset as it is considered more likely than not that it is realizable through a combination of future taxable income and the deductibility of future net deferred tax liabilities.
The following table summarizes the activity related to the gross unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions: (inthousands) March2, 2013 February25, 2012 Balance at beginning of year $ 124,963 $ 141,869 Increase related to current year positions 24,892 23,286 Increase related to prior year positions 1,183 12,533 Decrease related to prior year positions (36,104 ) (33,191 ) Settlements (15,670 ) (17,822 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (1,372 ) (1,712 ) Balance at end of year $ 97,892 $ 124,963 45 Table of Contents At March2, 2013, the Company has recorded approximately $17.8 million and $80.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits in current and non-current taxes payable, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet of which approximately $97.4 million would impact the Companys effective tax rate. At February25, 2012, the Company has recorded approximately $1.4 million and $123.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits in current and non-current taxes payable, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet of which approximately $123.3 million would impact the Companys effective tax rate. As of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits included approximately $18.9 million and $27.1 million, respectively, of accrued interest. The Company recorded a decrease of interest of approximately $4.9 million and an increase of interest of approximately $2.3 million for the years ended March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, respectively, for gross unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated statement of earnings.
The Company anticipates that any adjustments to gross unrecognized tax benefits which will impact income tax expense, due to the expiration of statutes of limitations, could be approximately $17.0 to $18.0 million in the next twelve months. However, actual results could differ from those currently anticipated.
As of March2, 2013, the Company operated in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada and several other international countries and files income tax returns in the United States and various state, local and international jurisdictions. The Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2009 through 2011. The Company is also open to examination for state and local jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations, generally ranging from three to five years.
For fiscal 2012, the effective tax rate is comprised of the Federal statutory income tax rate of 35.00%, the State income tax rate, net of Federal benefit, of 2.93%, provision for uncertain tax positions of 0.07% and other income tax benefits of 1.50%. For fiscal 2011, the effective tax rate is comprised of the Federal statutory income tax rate of 35.00%, the State income tax rate, net of Federal benefit, of 2.90%, provision for uncertain tax positions of 0.23% and other income tax benefits of 1.13%.

TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES WITH RELATED PARTIES In fiscal 2002, the Company had an interest in certain life insurance policies on the lives of its Co-Chairmen and their spouses. The Companys interest in these policies was equivalent to the net premiums paid by the Company. The agreements relating to the Companys interest in the life insurance policies on the lives of its Co-Chairmen and their spouses were terminated in fiscal 2003. Upon termination in fiscal 2003, the Co-Chairmen paid to the Company $5.4 million, representing the total amount of premiums paid by the Company under the agreements and the Company was released from its contractual obligation to make substantial future premium payments. In order to confer a benefit to its Co-Chairmen in substitution for the aforementioned terminated agreements, the Company has agreed to pay to the Co-Chairmen, at a future date, an aggregate amount of $4.2 million, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012.
9.
LEASES The Company leases retail stores, as well as distribution facilities, offices and equipment, under agreements expiring at various dates through 2041. Certain leases provide for contingent rents (which are based upon store sales exceeding stipulated amounts and are immaterial in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010), scheduled rent increases and renewal options. The Company is obligated under a majority of the leases to pay for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges.
46 Table of Contents As of March2, 2013, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: (inthousands) Operating Leases Fiscal Year: 2013 $ 561,104 2014 514,717 2015 456,751 2016 397,763 2017 329,869 Thereafter 1,092,941 Total future minimum lease payments $ 3,353,145 Expenses for all operating leases were $536.1 million, $456.2 million and $442.2 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
As a result of the World Market acquisition on June29, 2012 and in addition to the amounts disclosed above, the Company assumed various capital lease obligations. As of March2, 2013, the capital lease obligations are approximately $4.4 million, for which the current and long-term portions are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and deferred rent and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet. Monthly lease payments are accounted for as principal and interest payments. Interest expense for all capital leases was $0.4 million for fiscal 2012. The minimum capital lease payments, including interest, by fiscal year are: $1.1 million in fiscal 2013, $0.9 million in fiscal 2014, $0.8 million in fiscal 2015, $0.8 million in fiscal 2016, $0.7 million in fiscal 2017 and $3.2 million thereafter.
As a result of the World Market acquisition on June29, 2012 and in addition to the amounts disclosed above, the Company assumed two sale/leaseback agreements and recorded financing obligations, which approximated the discounted fair value of the minimum lease payments, had a residual fair value at the end of the lease term and are being amortized over the term of the respective agreements, including option periods, of 32 and 35 years. As of March2, 2013, the sale/leaseback financing obligations are approximately $105.9 million, for which the current and long-term portions are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and deferred rent and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet. Monthly lease payments are accounted for as principal and interest payments (at approximate annual interest rates of 7.2% and 10.6%). These sale/leaseback financing obligations, excluding the residual fair value at the end of the lease term, mature as follows: $0.6 million in fiscal 2013, $0.6 million in fiscal 2014, $0.7 million in fiscal 2015, $0.7 million in fiscal 2016, $0.8 million in fiscal 2017 and $78.9 million thereafter.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Defined Contribution Plans The Company has five defined contribution savings plans covering all eligible employees of the Company (the Plans). During fiscal 2011, a 401(k)savings plan was merged into one of the Plans. Participants of the Plans may defer annual pre-tax compensation subject to statutory and Plan limitations. In addition, a certain percentage of an employees contributions are matched by the Company and vest over a specified period of time, subject to certain statutory and Plan limitations. The Companys match was approximately $10.9 million, $9.4 million and $8.6 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which was expensed as incurred.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan The Company has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (NQDC) for the benefit of employees defined by the Internal Revenue Service as highly compensated. Participants of the NQDC may defer annual pre-tax compensation subject to statutory and plan limitations. In addition, a certain percentage of an employees contributions may be matched by the Company and vest over a specified period of time, subject to certain plan limitations. The Companys match was approximately $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which was expensed as incurred.
47 Table of Contents Changes in the fair value of the trading securities related to the NQDC and the corresponding change in the associated liability are included within interest income and selling, general and administrative expenses respectively, in the consolidated statements of earnings. Historically, these changes have resulted in no impact to the consolidated statements of earnings.
Defined Benefit Plan The Company has a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for the CTS employees, hired on or before July31, 2003, who meet specified age and length-of-service requirements. The benefits are based on years of service and the employees compensation near retirement. The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur. For the years ended March2, 2013, February25, 2012 and February26, 2011, the net periodic pension cost was not material to the Companys results of operations. The Company has a $14.4 million and $14.6 million liability, which is included in deferred rent and other liabilities as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, respectively. In addition, as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, the Company recognized a loss of $3.8 million, net of taxes of $2.5 million, and a loss of $3.9 million, net of taxes of $2.6 million, respectively, within accumulated other comprehensive loss.
11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company maintains employment agreements with its Co-Chairmen, which extend through June30, 2013. The agreements provide for a base salary (which may be increased by the Board of Directors), termination payments, postretirement benefits and other terms and conditions of employment. In addition, the Company maintains employment agreements with other executives which provide for severance pay and, in some instances, certain other supplemental retirement benefits.
The Company records an estimated liability related to its various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business when and to the extent that it concludes a liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such estimated loss is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to claims and legal actions and revises its estimated liabilities, as appropriate. The Company expects the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Company also cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings.
12.
SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION The Company paid income taxes of $550.6 million, $568.6 million and $487.4 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, the Company had interest payments of approximately $6.0 million in fiscal 2012. The amount of interest paid by the Company in fiscal 2011 was not material and the Company did not have any interest payments in fiscal 2010.
The Company recorded an accrual for capital expenditures of $37.0 million, $28.8 million and $17.8 million as of March2, 2013, February25, 2012 and February26, 2011, respectively.
48 Table of Contents 13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company measures all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and records such expense, net of estimated forfeitures, in its consolidated financial statements. Currently, the Companys stock-based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards.
Stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended March2, 2013, February25, 2012 and February26, 2011 was approximately $47.2 million ($30.0 million after tax or $0.13 per diluted share), $45.2 million ($28.5 million after tax or $0.12 per diluted share) and approximately $44.3 million ($27.1 million after tax or $0.10 per diluted share), respectively. In addition, the amount of stock-based compensation cost capitalized for each of the years ended March2, 2013 and February25, 2012 was approximately $1.3 million.
Incentive Compensation Plans During fiscal 2012, the Company adopted the Bed Bath& Beyond 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2012 Plan), which amended and restated the Bed Bath& Beyond 2004 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2004 Plan). The 2012 Plan generally incorporates the provisions of the 2004 Plan and also includes an increase in the aggregate number of common shares authorized for issuance by 14.3 million shares for a total of 43.2 million shares authorized for issuance and the ability to grant incentive stock options. Outstanding awards that were covered by the 2004 Plan will continue to be in effect under the 2012 Plan.
The 2012 Plan is a flexible compensation plan that enables the Company to offer incentive compensation through stock options (whether nonqualified stock options or incentive stock options), restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and other stock based awards, including cash awards. Under the 2012 Plan, grants are determined by the Compensation Committee for those awards granted to executive officers and by an appropriate committee for all other awards granted. Awards of stock options and restricted stock generally vest in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant.
The Company generally issues new shares for stock option exercises and restricted stock awards. As of March2, 2013, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Companys stock options and restricted stock awards was $23.5 million and $115.4 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.8 years and 3.6 years, respectively.
Stock Options Stock option grants are issued at fair market value on the date of grant and generally become exercisable in either three or five equal annual installments beginning one year from the date of grant for options issued since May10, 2010, and beginning one to three years from the date of grant for options issued prior to May10, 2010, in each case, subject, in general to the recipient remaining in the Companys employ or service on specified vesting dates. Option grants expire eight years after the date of grant for stock options issued since May10, 2004, and expire ten years after the date of grant for stock options issued prior to May10, 2004. All option grants are nonqualified.
The fair value of the stock options granted was estimated on the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table.

(3)Expected volatility is based on the average of historical and implied volatility. The historical volatility is determined by observing actual prices of the Companys stock over a period commensurate with the expected life of the awards. The implied volatility represents the implied volatility of the Companys call options, which are actively traded on multiple exchanges, had remaining maturities in excess of twelve months, had market prices close to the exercise prices of the employee stock options and were measured on the stock option grant date.
(4)Based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options.
Changes in the Companys stock options for the fiscal year ended March2, 2013 were as follows: (Sharesinthousands) NumberofStock Options WeightedAverage ExercisePrice Options outstanding, beginning of period 5,998 $ 38.96 Granted 503 68.57 Exercised (1,489 ) 37.67 Forfeited or expired (6 ) 37.38 Options outstanding, end of period 5,006 $ 42.32 Options exercisable, end of period 3,155 $ 38.20 The weighted average fair value for the stock options granted in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $22.95, $19.65 and $17.05, respectively. The weighted average remaining contractual term and the aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding as of March2, 2013 was 3.5 years and $79.2 million, respectively. The weighted average remaining contractual term and the aggregate intrinsic value for options exercisable as of March2, 2013 was 2.3 years and $59.1 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value for stock options exercised during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $38.8 million, $101.5 million and $50.5 million, respectively.
Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options for fiscal 2012 were $56.4 million and the net associated income tax benefit was $18.2 million.
Restricted Stock Restricted stock awards are issued and measured at fair market value on the date of grant and generally become vested in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant, subject, in general, to the recipient remaining in the Companys employ or service on specified vesting dates. Vesting of restricted stock awarded to certain of the Companys executives is dependent on the Companys achievement of a performance-based test for the fiscal year of grant and, assuming achievement of the performance-based test, time vesting, subject, in general, to the executive remaining in the Companys employ on specified vesting dates. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to these awards based on the assumption that the performance-based test will be achieved.

51 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. andsubsidiaries as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended March2, 2013. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended March2, 2013, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of March2, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated April30, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
/s/   KPMG LLP Short   Hills, New Jersey April30,   2013 52 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Shareholders Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.: We have audited Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of March2, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, appearing in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March2, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. acquired Linen Holdings, LLC on June1, 2012 and Cost Plus,Inc. on June29, 2012 (the Acquired Companies), and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of March2, 2013, the Acquired Companies internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $839.1 million (of which $533.1 million represented goodwill and intangible assets included within the scope of the assessment) and total net sales of $840.4 million included in the consolidated financial statements of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. as of and for the fiscal year ended March2, 2013. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Acquired Companies.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of March2, 2013 and February25, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows and the related financial statement schedule for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended March2, 2013, and our report dated April30, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
/s/   KPMG LLP Short   Hills, New Jersey April30,   2013 53 Table of Contents ITEM 9  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None.
ITEM 9A  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a)Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on their evaluation as of March2, 2013, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules13a-15(e)and 15d-15(e)under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by our management in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i)recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rulesand forms and (ii)accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b)Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f)under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March2, 2013. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
Pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commissions guidance, a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition, and therefore the recently acquired businesses, as described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, have been excluded. Included in the consolidated financial statements, as of and for the fiscal year ended March2, 2013, are total assets of the acquired businesses of approximately $839.1 million (of which $533.1 million represented goodwill and intangible assets included within the scope of the assessment) and total net sales of the acquired businesses of approximately $840.4 million.
Our management has concluded that, as of March2, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.
(c)Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm KPMG LLP issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
(d)Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended March2, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide such reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the Companys Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.
