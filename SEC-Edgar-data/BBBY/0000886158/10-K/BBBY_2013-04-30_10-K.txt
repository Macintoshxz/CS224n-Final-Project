Exhibits and   Financial Statement Schedules 2 Table of Contents PARTI Unless otherwise indicated, the term Company refers collectively to Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February27, 2010. The Companys fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest February28. Accordingly, fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 represented 52 weeks and ended on February27, 2010, February28, 2009, and March1, 2008, respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to periods of time (e.g., quarters and years) are to fiscal periods.
ITEM 1 - BUSINESS Introduction Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath& Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS), Harmon and Harmon Face Values (Harmon) and buybuy BABY.
In addition, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home& More.
The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings, which include food, giftware, health and beauty care items and infant and toddler merchandise. The Company believes that it is the nations largest operator of stores selling predominantly domestics merchandise and home furnishings while offering a breadth and depth of selection in most of its product categories that exceeds what is generally available in department stores or other specialty retail stores.
History The Company was founded in 1971 by Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg, the Co-Chairmen of the Company. Each has more than 49 years of experience in the retail industry.
The Company commenced operations in 1971 with the opening of two stores, which primarily sold bed linens and bath accessories. In 1985, the Company introduced its first store carrying a full line of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. The Company began using the name Bed Bath& Beyond in 1987 in order to reflect the expanded product line offered by its stores and to distinguish its stores from conventional specialty retail stores offering only domestics merchandise or home furnishings. In March2002, the Company acquired Harmon, a health and beauty care retailer, which operated 27 stores at the time located in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. In June2003, the Company acquired CTS, a retailer of giftware and household items, which operated 23 stores at the time located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island. In March2007, the Company acquired buybuy BABY, a retailer of infant and toddler merchandise, which operated 8 stores at the time located in Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia. In December2007, the Company opened its first international BBB store in Ontario, Canada. In May2008, the Company became a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home& More.
Operations It is the Companys goal to offer quality merchandise at everyday low prices; to maintain a wide assortment of merchandise; to present merchandise in a distinctive manner designed to maximize customer convenience and reinforce customer perception of wide selection; and to emphasize dedication to customer service and satisfaction.
Pricing.
The Company believes in maintaining everyday low prices. The Company regularly monitors price levels at its competitors in order to ensure that its prices are in accordance with its pricing philosophy. The Company believes that the application of its everyday low price philosophy is an important factor in establishing its reputation among customers.
Merchandise Assortment.
The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings, which include food, giftware, health and beauty care items and infant and toddler merchandise. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings includes categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares and general home furnishings.
3 Table of Contents The Company encourages local store personnel to tailor the merchandise mix as appropriate to respond to changing trends and conditions. The factors taken into account in selecting the merchandise mix for a particular store include store size and configuration and local market conditions such as climate and demographics. The Company, on an ongoing basis, tests new merchandise categories and adjusts the categories of merchandise carried in its stores and may add new departments or adjust the size of existing departments as required. Additionally, the Company continues to integrate the merchandise assortments within its concepts. The Company believes that the process of adding new departments, integrating the Companys merchandise within concepts, and expanding or reducing the size of various departments in response to changing conditions is an important part of its merchandising strategy.
Merchandise Presentation.
BBB has developed a distinctive style of merchandise presentation. Primarily all of the BBB stores have groups of related product lines presented together in separate areas of each store, creating the appearance that the store is comprised of several individual specialty stores for different product lines. BBB believes that its format of merchandise presentation makes it easy for customers to locate products, reinforces customer perception of wide selection and communicates to customers that its stores offer a level of customer service generally associated with smaller specialty stores.
BBB believes that its extensive merchandise selection, rather than fixturing, should be the focus of customer attention and, accordingly, primarily uses simple modular fixturing throughout its stores. This fixturing is primarily designed so that it can be easily reconfigured to adapt to changes in the stores merchandise mix and presentation. BBB believes that its merchandise displays create an exciting and attractive shopping environment that encourages impulse purchases of additional items.
Advertising.
In general, the Company relies on word of mouth advertising, its reputation for offering a wide assortment of quality merchandise at everyday low prices and the use of paid advertising. The Company distributes full-color circulars and other advertising pieces as its primary vehicles of paid advertising via direct mail or inserts. Also, to support the opening of new stores, the Company primarily uses grand opening direct mail and newspaper advertising.
Customer Service.
The Company places a strong focus on customer service and seeks to make shopping at its stores as pleasant and convenient as possible. Most stores are open seven days and six evenings a week in order to enable customers to shop at times that are convenient for them. In addition, the Companys websites, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, www.christmastreeshops.com, www.harmondiscount.com, www.facevalues.com and www.buybuybaby.com are available for customers to access 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Suppliers In fiscal 2009, the Company purchased its merchandise from approximately 5,200 suppliers with the Companys largest supplier accounting for approximately 4% of the Companys merchandise purchases and the Companys 10 largest suppliers accounting for approximately 20% of such purchases. The Company purchases substantially all of its merchandise in the United States, the majority from domestic sources and the balance from importers. The Company purchases a small amount of its merchandise directly from overseas sources.
The Company has no long term contracts for the purchase of merchandise. The Company believes that most merchandise, other than brand name goods, is available from a variety of sources and that most brand name goods can be replaced with comparable merchandise.
Warehousing The Companys merchandise displays allow a substantial amount of merchandise to be displayed on the sales floor at all times. Merchandise not displayed on the sales floor is typically stored in warehouse space within the store. In addition, the Company maintains 11 supplemental storage locations as well as three central distribution centers. The majority of the Companys merchandise is directly shipped to stores from vendors through third party carriers and service providers; the remainder of the Companys merchandise is shipped to stores through its distribution centers.
4 Table of Contents In addition, the Company maintains two E-Service fulfillment centers.
Employees As of February27, 2010, the Company employed approximately 41,000 persons in full-time and part-time positions. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are very good and that the labor turnover rate among its management employees is lower than that generally experienced within the industry.
Seasonality The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in the calendar months of August, Novemberand December, and generally lower in February.
Expansion Program The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets, the expansion or relocation of existing stores and the continuous review of strategic acquisitions. In the 18 year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2009, the Company has grown from 34 stores to 1,100 stores. The Companys 1,100 stores operate in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, including: 965 BBB stores operating in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 61 CTS stores operating in 15 states; 45 Harmon stores operating in three states; and 29 buybuy BABY stores operating in 14 states. Total square footage grew from approximately 0.9 million square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to approximately 33.7 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2009, the Company opened a total of 67 new stores, including 39 BBB stores throughout the United States and Canada, nine CTS stores, five Harmon stores and 14 buybuy BABY stores, and closed four BBB stores, all of which resulted in the aggregate addition of approximately 1.7 million square feet of store space. In addition, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home& More.
The Company intends to continue its expansion program and believes that the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, on the success of this program. As part of its expansion program, the Company expects to open new stores and expand existing stores as opportunities arise. The Company believes throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to open in excess of 1,300 BBB stores as well as grow the CTS and buybuy Baby concepts from coast to coast.
In determining where to open new stores, the Company evaluates a number of factors, including the availability of real estate, demographic information (such as data relating to income and education levels, age and occupation) and distribution. The Company has built its management structure with a view toward its expansion and believes that, as a result, it has the management depth necessary to support its anticipated expansion program.
Competition The Company believes it is the preeminent retailer in its segment of the home goods industry, which is fragmented and highly competitive. In addition, the BBB stores compete with many different types of retail stores that sell many or most of the same products. Such competitors include: (i)department stores, which often carry many of the same product lines as the Companys stores but do not typically have the same depth or breadth of product selection, (ii)specialty stores, which often have a depth of product selection but typically carry only a limited portion of the product lines carried by the Companys stores, (iii)discount and mass merchandise stores and (iv)national chains. In addition, the Companys stores compete, to a more limited extent, with factory outlet stores that typically offer limited quantities or limited lines of quality merchandise at discount prices.
Other retail chains continue to introduce new store concepts that include many of the product lines carried by the Companys stores.
5 Table of Contents There can be no assurance that the operation of store competitors will not have a material effect on the Company.
Tradenames and Service Marks The Company uses the Bed Bath& Beyond name and logo and the Beyond any store of its kind tag line as service marks in connection with retail services. The Company has registered these marks and others, including names and logos of CTS, Harmon and buybuy BABY, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company also has registered or has applications pending with the trademark registries of several foreign countries, including having registered the Bed Bath& Beyond name and logo and the Beyond any store of its kind tag line in Canada. Management believes that its name recognition and service marks are important elements of the Companys merchandising strategy.
Available Information The Company makes available as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), free of charge, through its website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, the Companys annual reports on Form10-K, quarterly reports on Form10-Q, current reports on Form8-K, and amendments to those reports, electronically filed or furnished pursuant to Section13(a)or 15(d)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors that may be outside the Companys control. Such factors include the following: General Economic Conditions General economic factors that are beyond the Companys control impact the Companys forecasts and actual performance. These factors include housing markets, recession, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, fuel and energy costs, interest rates, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, conditions affecting the retail environment for the home and other matters that influence consumer spending. Changes in the economic climate could adversely affect the Companys performance.
Competition and Pricing Pressures The retail business is highly competitive. The Company competes for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of the business with many other local, regional and national retailers. Those competitors range from specialty retail stores to department stores and discounters. Unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of those competitors, including promotional activity, may adversely affect the Companys performance.
Consumer Preferences and Demographic Factors The Companys success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing merchandise trends, customer demands and demographics. The Companys failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in customer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could lead to, among other things, excess inventories or a shortage of products and could have a material adverse affect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.
6 Table of Contents Unusual Weather Patterns The Companys operating results could be negatively impacted by unusual weather patterns. Frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms, hurricanes, floods, tornados or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect the Companys performance.
Cost of Labor, Merchandise and Other Expenses The Companys success depends, in part, on its ability to manage operating costs and to look for opportunities to reduce costs. The Companys ability to meet its labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. The Companys ability to find qualified vendors and obtain access to products in a timely and efficient manner can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, transportation costs and other factors beyond the Companys control.
Expansion Program The Companys growth depends, in part, on its ability to open new stores and operate profitably. The Companys ability to open additional stores successfully will depend on a number of factors, including its identification and availability of suitable store locations; its success in negotiating leases on acceptable terms; its hiring and training of skilled store operating personnel, especially management; and its timely development of new stores, including the availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction and other delays in store openings based on weather or other events. In addition, as the Companys business continues to grow, it is subject to more complex regulations and may be the target of private actions alleging violations of such regulations. This increases the cost of doing business and the risk that the Companys business practices could result in liabilities that may adversely affect its performance, despite the exercise of reasonable care.
Auction Rate Securities As of February27, 2010, the Company held approximately $178.6 million of net investments in auction rate securities. These securities are invested in preferred shares of closed end municipal bond funds, which are required, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, to maintain minimum asset coverage ratios of 200% and also are invested in securities collateralized by student loans which are currently more than 100% collateralized and with approximately 90% of such collateral in the aggregate being guaranteed by the United States government. None of the auction rate securities held by the Company are mortgage-backed debt obligations. Beginning in mid-February2008, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities failed and continues to fail. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. All of these investments carry triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies and the Company believes that given their high credit quality, it will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
During fiscal 2008, the Company entered into an agreement (the Agreement) with the investment firm that sold the Company a portion of its auction rate securities which have a par value of approximately $42.8 million at February 27, 2010. By entering into the Agreement, the Company (1) received the right (Put Option) to sell these auction rate securities back to the investment firm at par, at its sole discretion, anytime during the period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012, and (2) gave the investment firm the right to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on the Companys behalf at par anytime after the execution of the Agreement through July 2, 2012. As of February 27, 2010, the fair value of this option was approximately $2.3 million. The Company anticipates that any future changes in the fair value of the related auction rate securities will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the Put Option with no material impact to the consolidated statement of earnings. Because the Company intends to exercise its right to redeem these securities as soon as practicably possible during fiscal 2010, the fair value of these securities of approximately $40.5 million and the related option of approximately $2.3 million were classified as short term investment securities as of February 27, 2010.
7 Table of Contents As of February27, 2010, the remainder of the Companys investment in auction rate securities of approximately $137.9 million at par had a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2.1 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed to be temporary it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Companys net earnings for fiscal 2009. The Company does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in these auction rate securities, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program and planned capital expenditures. However, if the interest rate environment changes, the Company may incur further temporary impairment losses. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue and these markets deteriorate further, the Company may conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary and incur realized losses, including up to the full amount of the investments in auction rate securities, which could negatively affect the Companys financial position, cash flow and results of operations. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, approximately $38.5 million and $107.6 million, respectively, of auction rate securities, were redeemed at par. As of February27, 2010, the Company classified approximately $15.0 million of these securities as short term investment securities due to expected redemptions at par during the first half of fiscal 2010. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2009 through April22, 2010, the Company additionally redeemed approximately $14.1 million of these securities at par. The classification and valuation of these securities will continue to be reviewed quarterly.
Review of Equity Grants and Procedures and Related Matters In June2006, the Companys Board of Directors appointed a special committee of independent directors with authority, among other things, to conduct an investigation with respect to the setting of exercise prices for employee stock options and related matters. The review identified various deficiencies in the process of granting and documenting stock options and restricted shares. As a result of the deficiencies, the Company revised the measurement dates for various option grants.
The Companys past stock option granting procedures have exposed the Company to risk factors that could have an adverse affect on the Companys financial condition, including any tax implications relating to the Companys stock option grants.
ITEM 1B  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES Most of the Companys stores are located in suburban areas of medium and large-sized cities. These stores are situated in strip and power strip shopping centers, as well as in major off-price and conventional malls, and in free standing buildings.
The Companys 1,100 stores are located in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada and range in size from approximately 5,000 to 100,000 square feet, but are predominantly between 20,000 and 50,000 square feet. Approximately 85% to 90% of store space is used for selling areas and the balance for warehouse, receiving and office space.

The leases provide for original lease terms that generally range from 10 to 15 years and most leases provide for renewal options, often at increased rents. The Company evaluates leases on an ongoing basis which may lead to renegotiated lease terms, including rents during renewal options, or the possible relocation of stores. Certain leases provide for scheduled rent increases (which, in the case of fixed increases, the Company accounts for on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term, beginning when the Company obtains possession of the premises) and/or for contingent rent (based upon store sales exceeding stipulated amounts).
In addition, the Company leases storage space in 14 locations, totaling approximately 1.4 million square feet, that provide supplemental merchandise storage space and fulfillment of BBBs E-Service activities. This space is used to supplement the warehouse facilities in the Companys stores in proximity to these locations. In addition, the Company also owns two distribution centers totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet.
As of February27, 2010, the Company occupied approximately 355,000 square feet of office space at four locations for procurement and corporate office functions. Leased facilities in Farmingdale and Garden City, New York comprise approximately 120,000 square feet with the remaining approximately 235,000 square feet within owned facilities in Union, New Jersey and Middleboro, Massachusetts. In addition, the Company owns a building in Union, New Jersey next to the corporate office location to support its continuing headquarters growth.

13 Table of Contents ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath& Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS), Harmon and Harmon Face Values (Harmon) and buybuy BABY. In addition, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home& More. The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings, which include food, giftware, health and beauty care items and infant and toddler merchandise. The Companys objective is to be a customers first choice for products and services in the categories offered, in the markets in which the Company operates.
The Companys strategy is to achieve this objective through excellent customer service, an extensive breadth and depth of assortment, everyday low prices, introduction of new merchandising offerings and development of its infrastructure.
Operating in the highly competitive retail industry, the Company, along with other retail companies, is influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions including the housing market, the overall macroeconomic environment and related changes in the retailing environment, consumer preferences and spending habits, unusual weather patterns, competition from existing and potential competitors, and the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program.
Although there appears to be some indication of improvement in economic conditions, the difficult conditions affecting the overall macroeconomic environment continued to impact the retail sector in general. The Company believes that the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and factors such as the high unemployment rate and issues specific to the housing industry, including a reduction in home values, continued to negatively impact consumer confidence and the level of discretionary spending by consumers. The Company cannot predict whether, when or the manner in which these economic conditions will change.
In addition, during the difficult conditions affecting the overall macroeconomic environment, a number of businesses in the retail industry have liquidated, including those within the Companys sector of retailing. The Company believes that this industry consolidation will provide an opportunity to gain market share and to improve its competitive position over the long term; however, the Company cannot, with any level of certainty, estimate the impact these liquidations will have on its future results of operations.
In light of the risks posed by the current macroeconomic environment, the Company continues to systematically review all expenditures with the goal of prudently managing its business. At the same time, the Company remains committed to making the required investments in its infrastructure to help position the Company for continued success. The Company continues to review and prioritize its capital needs while continuing to make investments, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements, and other projects whose impact is considered important to its future.
During fiscal 2009, the Company experienced an approximate 4.4% increase in comparable store sales as compared with an approximate 2.4% decrease in comparable store sales for fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2009 net sales and comparable store sales reflected consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings.
Fiscal 2008 net sales and comparable store sales were negatively affected by the economic slowdown, including issues specific to the housing industry and the liquidation sales of a number of retailers, including a then significant competitor.
The following represents an overview of the Companys financial performance for the periods indicated:  Net sales in fiscal   2009 increased approximately 8.6% to $7.829 billion; net sales in fiscal 2008   increased approximately 2.3% to $7.208 billion over net sales of $7.049   billion in fiscal 2007.
Comparable store sales   for fiscal 2009 increased by approximately 4.4% as compared with a decrease   of approximately 2.4% in fiscal 2008 and an increase of approximately 1.0% in   fiscal 2007.
14 Table of Contents A store is considered a   comparable store when it has been open for twelve full months following its   grand opening period (typically four to six weeks). Stores relocated or   expanded are excluded from comparable store sales if the change in square   footage would cause meaningful disparity in sales over the prior period. In   the case of a store to be closed, such stores sales are not considered   comparable once the store closing process has commenced.
Gross profit for fiscal   2009 was $3.208 billion or 41.0% of net sales compared with $2.873 billion or   39.9% of net sales for fiscal 2008 and $2.925 billion or 41.5% of net sales   for fiscal 2007.
Selling, general and   administrative expenses (SG&A) for fiscal 2009 were $2.227 billion or   28.5% of net sales compared with $2.199 billion or 30.5% of net sales for   fiscal 2008 and $2.087 billion or 29.6% of net sales for fiscal 2007.
The effective tax rate   was 39.1%, 37.8% and 35.0% for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007,   respectively.
Net earnings for the fiscal year ended   February27, 2010 were $2.30 per diluted share ($600.0 million),   compared to fiscal 2008 net earnings of $1.64 per diluted share ($425.1   million) and fiscal 2007 net earnings of $2.10 per diluted share ($562.8   million).
During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Companys capital expenditures were $153.7 million, $215.9 million and $358.2 million, respectively. Included in fiscal 2007s capital expenditures were costs associated with a new distribution center and a new E-service fulfillment center to support the Companys growth.
The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long term objectives. In fiscal 2010, the Company expects to open approximately 60 new stores, including approximately 30 BBB stores throughout the United States and Canada, approximately 10 CTS stores, and approximately 20 buybuy BABY stores.
During fiscal 2009, the Company opened a total of 67 new stores, including 39 BBB stores throughout the United States and Canada, nine CTS stores, five Harmon stores and 14 buybuy BABY stores and closed four BBB stores.
15 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated (i)selected statement of earnings data of the Company expressed as a percentage of net sales and (ii)the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of earnings data: Fiscal Year Ended Percentage Percentage Change of Net Sales from Prior Year February27, February28, March1, February27, February28, 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Net   sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 8.6 % 2.3 % Cost   of sales 59.0 60.1 58.5 6.6 5.1 Gross   profit 41.0 39.9 41.5 11.7 (1.8 ) Selling,   general and administrative expenses 28.5 30.5 29.6 1.3 5.4 Operating   profit 12.5 9.3 11.9 45.5 (19.6 ) Earnings   before provision for income taxes 12.6 9.5 12.3 44.2 (21.0 ) Net   earnings 7.7 5.9 8.0 41.1 (24.5 ) Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2009 increased $620.5 million to $7.829 billion, representing an increase of 8.6% over $7.208 billion of net sales in fiscal 2008, which increased $159.4 million or 2.3% over the $7.049 billion of net sales in fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2009, approximately 51.4% of the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the Companys comparable store sales. For fiscal 2008, the increase in net sales was generated by the Companys new store sales increase of 4.6% partially offset by the decrease in comparable store sales.
For fiscal 2009, comparable store sales for 942 stores represented $7.409 billion of net sales; for fiscal 2008, comparable store sales for 874 stores represented $6.746 billion of net sales; and for fiscal 2007, comparable store sales for 792 stores represented $6.457 billion of net sales. Comparable store sales increased by approximately 4.4% for fiscal 2009 and decreased by approximately 2.4% for fiscal 2008.
Fiscal 2009 net sales and comparable store sales reflected consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings.
For fiscal 2008, net sales and comparable store sales were negatively affected by the economic slowdown including issues specific to the housing industry, and the liquidation sales of a number of retailers, including a then significant competitor.
Sales of domestics merchandise accounted for approximately 41%, 43% and 44% of net sales in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of which the Company estimates that bed linens accounted for approximately 13%, 13% and 14% of net sales in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The remaining net sales in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 of 59%, 57% and 56%, respectively, represented sales of home furnishings. No other individual product category accounted for 10% or more of net sales during fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007.
Gross Profit Gross profit in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $3.208 billion or 41.0 % of net sales, $2.873 billion or 39.9% of net sales and $2.925 billion or 41.5% of net sales, respectively. The increase in gross profit between fiscal 2009 and 2008 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to decreases in inventory acquisition costs, coupon redemptions and markdowns, partially offset by a shift in the mix of merchandise sold as the Company continues to experience a higher percentage of sales of home furnishings. The decrease in gross 16 Table of Contents profit between fiscal 2008 and 2007 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in inventory acquisition costs, an increase in coupon redemptions and the shift in the mix of merchandise sold as the Company continued to experience a higher percentage of sales of home furnishings.
Selling, General and Administrative expenses SG&A was $2.227 billion or 28.5 % of net sales in fiscal 2009, $2.199 billion or 30.5% of net sales in fiscal 2008 and $2.087 billion or 29.6% of net sales in fiscal 2007. The decrease in SG&A between fiscal 2009 and 2008 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a relative decrease in advertising expenses resulting from a decrease in the distribution of advertising pieces. Also contributing to the decrease were relative decreases in payroll expenses and occupancy costs (including rent, utilities and depreciation). The increase in SG&A between fiscal 2008 and 2007 as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the 2.4% decline in comparable store sales, resulting in relative increases in occupancy costs (including rent, depreciation and real estate taxes), as well as relative increases in payroll-related items (including salaries and benefits). Also contributing to the increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales were relative increases in advertising expenses, including increases in postage, paper and other production costs.
Operating Profit Operating profit for fiscal 2009 was $980.7 million or 12.5% of net sales, $673.9 million or 9.3% of net sales in fiscal 2008 and $838.0 million or 11.9% of net sales in fiscal 2007. The changes in operating profit as a percentage of net sales were a result of the changes in the gross profit margin and SG&A as a percentage of net sales as described above.
Interest Income Interest income was $4.6 million, $9.4 million and $27.2 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest income decreased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of lower interest rates partially offset by an increase in the fair value of the trading investment securities related to the Companys nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Interest income decreased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of lower interest rates.
Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 39.1% for fiscal 2009, 37.8% for fiscal 2008 and 35.0% for fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2009, the tax rate included an approximate $3.2 million provision primarily due to the recognition of certain discrete tax items partially offset by the changing of the blended state tax rate of deferred income taxes. The remaining increase in the 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to slightly higher state taxes. For fiscal 2008, the tax rate included an approximate $0.8 million benefit primarily due to the recognition of certain discrete tax items and the changing of the blended state tax rate of deferred income taxes.
The Company expects continued volatility in the effective tax rate from year to year because the Company is required each year to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit.
EXPANSION PROGRAM The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets, the expansion or relocation of existing stores and the continuous review of strategic acquisitions. In the 18 year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2009, the chain has grown from 34 to 1,100 stores. Total square footage grew from 0.9 million square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to 33.7 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2009.
During fiscal 2009, the Company opened a total of 67 new stores, including 39 BBB stores throughout the United States and Canada, nine CTS stores, five Harmon stores and 14 buybuy BABY stores, and closed four BBB stores, all of which resulted in the aggregate addition of approximately 1.7 17 Table of Contents million square feet of store space.
In May2008, the Company became a partner in a joint venture which operates two stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home& More.
The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long term objectives. In fiscal 2010, the Company expects to open approximately 60 new stores, including approximately 30 BBB stores throughout the United States and Canada, approximately 10 CTS stores and approximately 20 buybuy BABY stores.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company has no outstanding bank borrowings and has been able to finance its operations, including its expansion program, entirely through internally generated funds. For fiscal 2010, the Company believes that it will continue to finance its operations, including its expansion program and planned capital expenditures, entirely through internally generated funds. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2010, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, and information technology enhancements and other projects, are planned to be approximately $225.0 million.
Fiscal 2009 compared to Fiscal 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2009 was $905.4 million, compared with $584.0 million in fiscal 2008. Year over year, the Company experienced a decrease in cash used for the net components of working capital (primarily accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and income taxes payable, partially offset by merchandise inventories), and an increase in net earnings.
Inventory per square foot was $52.15 as of February27, 2010, an increase of approximately 1.8% from $51.24 as of February28, 2009. The Company continues to focus on optimizing inventory productivity while maintaining appropriate in-store merchandise levels to support sales.
Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2009 was $488.7 million, compared with $113.1 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, net cash used in investing activities was due to $335.0 million of purchases of investment securities, net of redemptions, and $153.7 million of capital expenditures. In fiscal 2008, net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $215.9 million of capital expenditures partially offset by $107.6 million of redemptions of investment securities.
Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2009 was $11.2 million, compared with net cash used in financing activities of $26.8 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in net cash provided was primarily due to an $82.1 million increase in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by a $46.8 million increase in common stock repurchases.
Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2008 was $584.0 million, compared with $614.5 million in fiscal 2007. Year over year, the Company experienced a decrease in cash provided by net earnings, partially offset by lower cash used for the net components of working capital (primarily income taxes payable and merchandise inventories offset by merchandise credit and gift card liabilities and accrued expenses and other current liabilities).
Inventory per square foot was $51.24 as of February28, 2009, a decrease of approximately 4.4% from $53.58 as of March1, 2008.
Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2008 was $113.1 million, compared with net cash provided by investing activities of $101.7 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $215.9 million of capital expenditures partially offset by $107.6 million of redemptions of investment securities. In fiscal 2007, net cash provided by 18 Table of Contents investing activities was due to $545.8 million of redemptions of investment securities, net of purchases, partially offset by $358.2 million of capital expenditures and $85.9 million in payment for the acquisition of buybuy BABY.
Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2008 was $26.8 million, compared with $705.5 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in common stock repurchases.
Auction Rate Securities As of February27, 2010, the Company held approximately $178.6 million of net investments in auction rate securities. Beginning in mid-February2008, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities failed and continues to fail. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. All of these investments carry triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies and the Company believes that given their high credit quality, it will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
During fiscal 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with the investment firm that sold the Company a portion of its auction rate securities to redeem at par approximately $42.8 million of these securities. This agreement provides for, among other things, the option to redeem these securities at par anytime during the period from June30, 2010 through July2, 2012. As of February27, 2010, the fair value of this option was approximately $2.3 million. Because the Company intends to exercise its right to redeem these securities as soon as practicably possible during fiscal 2010, the fair value of these securities of approximately $40.5 million and the related option of approximately $2.3 million were classified as short term investment securities as of February27, 2010.
During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of approximately $0.5 million related to these securities and also recorded approximately $0.5 million of pre-tax income to reflect the increase in fair value of the option to redeem these securities at par value. This resulted in no impact on the Companys net earnings. The Company anticipates that any future changes in the fair value of the related auction rate securities will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the option with no material impact to the Companys net earnings.
As of February 27, 2010, the remainder of approximately $137.9 million of these securities at par had a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2.1 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed to be temporary, it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Companys net earnings for fiscal 2009. As of February27, 2010, the Company classified approximately $15.0 million of these securities as short term investment securities due to expected redemptions at par during the first half of fiscal 2010.
The Company does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in its auction rate securities, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments. These investments will remain primarily classified as non-current assets until the Company has better visibility as to when their liquidity will be restored. The classification and valuation of these securities will continue to be reviewed quarterly.
During fiscal 2009 and 2008, approximately $38.5 million and $107.6 million, respectively, of auction rate securities were redeemed at par. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2009 through April22, 2010, the Company additionally redeemed approximately $14.1 million at par.
Other Fiscal 2009 Information At February27, 2010, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million each, with expiration dates of September3, 2010 and February28, 2011, respectively. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently and are expected to be 19 Table of Contents used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. During fiscal 2009, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of February27, 2010, there was approximately $6.1 million of outstanding letters of credit. Although no assurances can be provided, the Company intends to renew both uncommitted lines of credit before the respective expiration dates. In addition, as of February27, 2010, the Company maintained unsecured standby letters of credit of $55.0 million, primarily for certain insurance programs.
Between December2004 and September2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized, through several share repurchase programs, the repurchase of $2.950 billion of its shares of common stock. The Company was authorized to make repurchases from time to time in the open market or through other parameters approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to existing rulesand regulations. The Company has approximately $824 million remaining of authorized share repurchases as of February27, 2010. The execution of the Companys current share repurchase program will consider current business and market conditions.
The Company has contractual obligations consisting mainly of operating leases for stores, offices, warehouse facilities and equipment, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities which the Company is obligated to pay as of February27, 2010 as follows: (in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years Operating   Lease Obligations (1) $ 3,056,263 $ 440,751 $ 793,402 $ 626,201 $ 1,195,909 Purchase   Obligations (2) 701,919 701,919    Other   long-term liabilities (3) 349,672     Total   Contractual Obligations $ 4,107,854 $ 1,142,670 $ 793,402 $ 626,201 $ 1,195,909 (1) The amounts presented represent the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases. In addition to minimum rent, certain of the Companys leases require the payment of additional costs for insurance, maintenance and other costs. These additional amounts are not included in the table of contractual commitments as the timing and/or amounts of such payments are not known. As of February27, 2010, the Company has leased sites for 21 new stores planned for opening in fiscal 2010 or 2011, for which aggregate minimum rental payments over the term of the leases are approximately $121.1 million and are included in the table above.
(2) Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise.
(3) Amounts recorded as deferred rent and other liabilities and income taxes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February27, 2010 have been reflected only in the Total column in the table above as the timing and/or amount of any cash payment is uncertain. Deferred rent and other liabilities are primarily comprised of deferred rent, workers compensation and general liability reserves and various other accruals.
SEASONALITY The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in the calendar months of August, Novemberand December, and generally lower in February.
INFLATION The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future.
20 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance which established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the exclusive source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Rulesand interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are also considered sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification supersedes all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards, however it does not change current GAAP. The Codification was effective for all financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September15, 2009. Accordingly, the Company has reflected all necessary changes in this filing.
In June2006, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance related to income taxes. This guidance addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. A company may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities. This guidance also provided direction on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and required increased disclosures. On March4, 2007, the Company adopted this guidance and recognized a $13.1 million increase to retained earnings to reflect the change to its liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits as required. The Company also recorded additional gross unrecognized tax benefits, and corresponding higher deferred tax assets, of $35.6 million as a result of the adoption.
On March2, 2008 and March1, 2009, the Company adopted the accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures for financial assets and liabilities and for non-financial assets and liabilities, respectively. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The adoption of this guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In April2009, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance related to financial instruments which requires the annual disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments to be presented in interim financial statements. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company adopted this guidance which did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In April2009, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance related to investments in debt and equity securities which modifies the recognition requirements for other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities and enhances existing disclosures with respect to other-than-temporary impairments of debt and equity securities, however, it does not modify existing recognition and measurement guidance related to other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company adopted this guidance which did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In April2009, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures which provides guidance for determining fair value when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales, and also amends the interim and annual disclosure requirements. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company adopted this guidance which did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In January2010, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures which amends and clarifies existing disclosure requirements. This updated accounting guidance requires new disclosures related to amounts transferred into and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements as well as separate disclosures of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements 21 Table of Contents related to amounts reported as Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance also clarifies existing fair value disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation and the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2009, except for the separate disclosures of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to amounts reported as Level 3 fair value measurements, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2010. The Company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
REVIEW OF EQUITY GRANTS AND PROCEDURES AND RELATED MATTERS In June2006, the Companys Board of Directors appointed a special committee of independent directors with authority, among other things, to conduct an investigation with respect to the setting of exercise prices for employee stock options and related matters. The review identified various deficiencies in the process of granting and documenting stock options and restricted shares. As a result of the deficiencies, the Company revised the measurement dates for various option grants.
The Companys past stock option granting procedures have exposed the Company to risk factors that could have an adverse affect on the Companys financial condition, including any tax implications relating to the Companys stock option grants.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, accruals for self insurance, litigation, store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Inventory Valuation : Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB, Harmon and buybuy BABY are calculated using the weighted average retail inventory method and inventory costs for CTS are calculated using the first in first out cost method.
Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail values of inventories. The cost associated with determining the cost to retail ratio includes: merchandise purchases, net of returns to vendors, discounts and volume and incentive rebates; inbound freight expenses; duty, insurance and commissions.
At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions.
The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory counts for locations at which counts were conducted. For locations where physical inventory counts were not conducted in the fiscal year, an estimated shrink reserve is recorded based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile.
22 Table of Contents The Company accrues for merchandise in transit once it takes legal ownership and title to the merchandise; as such, an estimate for merchandise in transit is included in the Companys merchandise inventories.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. The Company has not historically recorded any material impairment to its long-lived assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that a long-lived asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these long-lived assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets : The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets. The Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets and determined that, as of February27, 2010, no impairment existed because the fair value of these assets substantially exceeded their carrying values. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs .
Self Insurance : The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
Litigation : The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to such claims and legal actions and revises its estimates, as appropriate. The ultimate resolution of these ongoing matters as a result of future developments could have a material impact on the Companys earnings. The Company cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings.
Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs : Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation: The Company uses a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options. The Black-Scholes model includes various assumptions, including the expected life of stock options, the expected risk free interest rate and the expected volatility. These assumptions reflect the Companys best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of the Company. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, total stock-based compensation cost could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if the Company uses different assumptions for future grants, stock-based compensation cost could be materially impacted in future periods.
23 Table of Contents The Company determines its assumptions for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in accordance with the accounting guidance related to stock compensation.
The expected life of stock options is estimated based on historical experience.
The expected risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options.
Expected volatility is based on the average of historical and implied volatility. The historical volatility is determined by observing actual prices of the Companys stock over a period commensurate with the expected life of the awards. The implied volatility represents the implied volatility of the Companys call options, which are actively traded on multiple exchanges, had remaining maturities in excess of twelve months, had market prices close to the exercise prices of the employee stock options and were measured on the stock option grant date.
The Company is required to record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. The Companys forfeiture rate assumption used in determining its stock-based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data. The actual forfeiture rate could differ from these estimates.
Income Taxes : The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of its Canadian subsidiary. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes in most cases.
During the fiscal first quarter of 2007, the Company adopted updated accounting guidance related to income taxes. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.
The Company expects continued volatility in the effective tax rate from year to year because the Company is required each year to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit.
Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form10-K and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors that may be outside the Companys control. Such factors include, without limitation: general economic conditions including the housing market, a challenging overall macroeconomic environment and related changes in the retailing environment, consumer preferences and spending habits; demographics and other macroeconomic factors that may impact the level of spending for 24 Table of Contents the types of merchandise sold by the Company; unusual weather patterns; competition from existing and potential competitors; competition from other channels of distribution; pricing pressures; the cost of labor, merchandise and other costs and expenses; the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program; the impact of failed auctions for auction rate securities held by the Company; and matters arising out of or related to the Companys stock option grants and procedures and related matters, including any tax implications relating to the Companys stock option grants. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update its forward-looking statements.
ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of February27, 2010, the Companys investments include cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.096 billion, short term investment securities of approximately $431.5 million and long term investment securities of approximately $132.9 million at weighted average interest rates of 0.02%, 0.15% and 0.32%, respectively.
As of February27, 2010, the Company held approximately $178.6 million of net investments in auction rate securities. Beginning in mid-February2008, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities failed and continues to fail. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. All of these investments carry triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies and the Company believes that given their high credit quality, it will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities.
During fiscal 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with the investment firm that sold the Company a portion of its auction rate securities to redeem at par approximately $42.8 million of these securities. This agreement provides for, among other things, the option to redeem these securities at par anytime during the period from June30, 2010 through July2, 2012. As of February27, 2010, the fair value of this option was approximately $2.3 million. Because the Company intends to exercise its right to redeem these securities as soon as practicably possible during fiscal 2010, the fair value of these securities of approximately $40.5 million and the related option of approximately $2.3 million were classified as short term investment securities as of February27, 2010.
During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of approximately $0.5 million related to these securities and also recorded approximately $0.5 million of pre-tax income to reflect the increase in fair value of the option to redeem these securities at par value. This resulted in no impact on the Companys net earnings. The Company anticipates that any future changes in the fair value of the related auction rate securities will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the option with no material impact to the Companys net earnings.
As of February 27, 2010, the remainder of approximately $137.9 million of these securities at par had a temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2.1 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed to be temporary, it was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Companys net earnings for fiscal 2009. As of February27, 2010, the Company classified approximately $15.0 million of these securities as short term investment securities due to expected redemptions at par during the first half of fiscal 2010. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2009 through April22, 2010, the Company additionally redeemed approximately $14.1 million of these securities at par.
During fiscal 2009 and 2008, approximately $38.5 million and $107.6 million, respectively, of auction rate securities were redeemed at par.
The Company does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in its auction rate securities, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments. These investments are primarily classified as non-current assets until the Company has better visibility as to when their liquidity will be restored. The classification and valuation of these securities will continue to be reviewed quarterly.
25 Table of Contents However, if the interest rate environment changes, the Company may incur further temporary impairment losses. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue and these markets deteriorate further, the Company may conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary and incur realized losses, including up to the full amount of the investments in auction rate securities, which could negatively affect the Companys financial position, cash flow and results of operations.

Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
D.
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as impairment of auction rate securities, inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, accruals for self insurance, litigation, store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, the provision for sales returns, vendor allowances, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
E.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Included in cash and cash equivalents are credit and debit card receivables from banks, which typically settle within 5 business days, of $56.0 million and $51.8 million as of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, respectively.
F.
Investment Securities Investment securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury Bills with remaining maturities of less than one year and auction rate securities, which are securities with interest rates that reset periodically through an auction process. The U.S. Treasury Bills are 32 Table of Contents classified as short term held-to-maturity securities and stated at their amortized cost which approximates fair value. Auction rate securities are classified as available-for-sale or trading and are stated at fair value, which had historically been consistent with cost or par value due to interest rates which reset periodically, typically every 7, 28 or 35 days. As a result, there generally were no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains or losses relating to these auction rate securities. However, beginning in mid-February2008 due to market conditions, the auction process for the Companys auction rate securities failed and continues to fail. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities, and affect their estimated fair values at February27, 2010, but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. (See Fair Value Measurements, Note 5 and Investment Securities, Note 6). All income from these investments is recorded as interest income.
Those investment securities which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments and are stated at amortized cost. Those investment securities which are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are stated at fair market value.
Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted over the life of the security as adjustments to interest income using the effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
G.
Inventory Valuation Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB and Harmon are calculated using the weighted average retail inventory method and inventory costs for CTS are calculated using the first in first out cost method. Beginning on March2, 2008 inventory costs for buybuy BABY are calculated using the weighted average retail inventory method, whereas previously, they were calculated using the first in first out cost method. The impact of the change in the method of accounting was not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail values of inventories. The cost associated with determining the cost to retail ratio includes: merchandise purchases, net of returns to vendors, discounts and volume and incentive rebates; inbound freight expenses; duty, insurance and commissions.
At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions.
The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory counts for locations at which counts were conducted. For locations where physical inventory counts were not conducted in the fiscal year, an estimated shrink reserve is recorded based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile.
The Company accrues for merchandise in transit once it takes legal ownership and title to the merchandise; as such, an estimate for merchandise in transit is included in the Companys merchandise inventories.
H.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (forty years for buildings; five to twenty years for furniture, fixtures and equipment; and three to seven years for computer equipment and software). Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful life or the life of the lease. Depreciation expense is included within selling, general and administrative expenses.
33 Table of Contents The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to earnings as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs amounted to $86.2 million, $81.1 million and $72.9 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
I.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. The Company has not historically recorded any material impairment to its long-lived assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that a long-lived asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these long-lived assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
J.
Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available, including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets. T he Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets and determined that, as of February27, 2010, no impairment existed because the fair value of these assets substantially exceeded their carrying values.
In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Included within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, respectively, is $198.7 million for goodwill and $30.9 million for tradenames.
K.
Self Insurance The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
L.
Deferred Rent The Company accounts for scheduled rent increases contained in its leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease beginning as of the date the Company obtained possession of the leased premises. Deferred rent amounted to $78.7 million and $79.5 million as of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, respectively.
34 Table of Contents Cash or lease incentives (tenant allowances) received pursuant to certain store leases are recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction to rent over the lease term. The unamortized portion of tenant allowances is included in deferred rent and other liabilities. Tenant allowances amounted to $86.8 million and $72.7 million as of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, respectively.
M.
Treasury Stock Between December2004 and September2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized, through several share repurchase programs, the repurchase of $2.950 billion of its shares of common stock. The Company was authorized to make repurchases from time to time in the open market or through other parameters approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to existing rulesand regulations. During fiscal 2009, the Company repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $94.9 million. During fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $48.1 million. During fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 20.6 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $734.2 million.
N.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, accounts payable and certain other liabilities. The Companys investment securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, which are stated at amortized cost, and auction rate securities, which are stated at their approximate fair value. The book value of all financial instruments is representative of their fair values. On March2, 2008 and March1, 2009, the Company adopted the accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures for financial assets and liabilities and for non-financial assets and liabilities, respectively (See Fair Value Measurements, Note 5).
O.
Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at the Companys retail stores or upon delivery for products purchased from its websites. The value of point of sale coupons and point of sale rebates that result in a reduction of the price paid by the customer are recorded as a reduction of sales. Shipping and handling fees that are billed to a customer in a sale transaction are recorded in sales. Taxes, such as sales tax, use tax and value added tax, are not included in sales.
Revenues from gift cards, gift certificates and merchandise credits are recognized when redeemed. Gift cards have no provisions for reduction in the value of unused card balances over defined time periods and have no expiration dates, but are subject to state escheat regulations; as such, the Company does not record income associated with unredeemed gift cards.
Sales returns are provided for in the period that the related sales are recorded based on historical experience. Although the estimate for sales returns has not varied materially from historical provisions, actual experience could vary from historical experience in the future if the level of sales return activity changes materially. In the future, if the Company concludes that an adjustment to the sales return accrual is required due to material changes in the returns activity, the reserve will be adjusted accordingly.
P.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise, buying costs and costs of the Companys distribution network including inbound freight charges, distribution facility costs, receiving costs, internal transfer costs and shipping and handling costs.
35 Table of Contents Q.
Vendor Allowances The Company receives allowances from vendors in the normal course of business for various reasons including direct cooperative advertising, purchase volume and reimbursement for other expenses. Annual terms for each allowance include the basis for earning the allowance and payment terms which vary by agreement. All vendor allowances are recorded as a reduction of inventory cost, except for direct cooperative advertising allowances which are specific, incremental and identifiable. The Company recognizes purchase volume allowances as a reduction of the cost of inventory in the quarter in which milestones are achieved. Advertising costs were reduced by direct cooperative allowances of $14.5 million, $14.9 million and $11.1 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
R.
Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred.
S.
Advertising Costs Expenses associated with direct response advertising are expensed over the period during which the sales are expected to occur, generally four to six weeks, and all other expenses associated with store advertising are charged to earnings as incurred. Net advertising costs amounted to $230.6 million, $266.4 million and $239.6 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
T.
Stock-Based Compensation The Company measures all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and records such expense in its consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted the accounting guidance related to stock compensation on August28, 2005 (the date of adoption) under the modified prospective application. Under this application, the Company records stock-based compensation expense for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption and for the portion of previously granted awards that remained unvested at the date of adoption. Currently, the Companys stock-based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards.
U. Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return. Income tax returns are also filed with each taxable jurisdiction in which the Company conducts business.
The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of its Canadian subsidiary. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes in most cases.
During the first quarter of 2007, the Company adopted updated accounting guidance related to income taxes. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial 36 Table of Contents statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.
Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
V.
Litigation The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to such claims and legal actions and revises its estimates, as appropriate. The ultimate resolution of these ongoing matters as a result of future developments could have a material impact on the Companys earnings. The Company cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings.
W.
Earnings per Share The Company presents earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis. Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding including the dilutive effect of stock-based awards as calculated under the treasury stock method.
Stock-based awards of approximately 9.8 million, 15.3 million and 10.9 million shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
X.
Segments The Company accounts for its operations as one operating segment.
Y.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance which established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the exclusive source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Rulesand interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are also considered sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification supersedes all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards, however it does not change current GAAP. The Codification was effective for all financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September15, 2009. Accordingly, the Company has reflected all necessary changes in this filing.
In June2006, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance related to income taxes. This guidance addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. A company may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities. This guidance also provided direction on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and required increased disclosures. On March4, 2007, the Company adopted this guidance and recognized a $13.1 million increase to retained earnings to reflect the change to its liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits as required. The Company also recorded additional gross unrecognized tax benefits, and 37 Table of Contents corresponding higher deferred tax assets, of $35.6 million as a result of the adoption.
In April2009, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance related to financial instruments which requires the annual disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments to be presented in interim financial statements. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company adopted this guidance which did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements (See Fair Value of Financial Instruments , Note 1N).
In April2009, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance related to investments in debt and equity securities which modifies the recognition requirements for other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities and enhances existing disclosures with respect to other-than-temporary impairments of debt and equity securities, however, it does not modify existing recognition and measurement guidance related to other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company adopted this guidance which did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements (See Investment Securities, Note 6).
In April2009, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures which provides guidance for determining fair value when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales, and also amends the interim and annual disclosure requirements. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company adopted this guidance which did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements (See Fair Value Measurements, Note 5).
In January2010, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures which amends and clarifies existing disclosure requirements. This updated accounting guidance requires new disclosures related to amounts transferred into and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements as well as separate disclosures of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to amounts reported as Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance also clarifies existing fair value disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation and the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2009, except for the separate disclosures of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to amounts reported as Level 3 fair value measurements, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2010. The Company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
2.
ACQUISITION On March22, 2007, the Company completed and announced the acquisition of buybuy BABY, a retailer of infant and toddler merchandise, for approximately $67 million (net of cash acquired) and repayment of debt of approximately $19 million. Based in Garden City, New York, buybuy BABY operated a total of 8 stores at the time of acquisition, in Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia. The stores range in size from approximately 28,000 to 60,000 square feet and offer a broad assortment of premier infant and toddler merchandise in categories including furniture, car seats, strollers, feeding, bedding, bath, health and safety essentials, toys, learning and development products, clothing and a unique selection of seasonal and holiday products. (See Transactions and Balances with Related Parties, Note 8).
The results of buybuy BABYs operations, which are not material, have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.

LINES OF CREDIT At February27, 2010, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million each, with expiration dates of September3, 2010 and February28, 2011, respectively. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently and are expected to be used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. During fiscal 2009, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of February27, 2010, there was approximately $6.1 million of outstanding letters of credit. Although no assurances can be provided, the Company intends to renew both uncommitted lines of credit before the respective expiration dates. In addition, as of February27, 2010, the Company maintained unsecured standby letters of credit of $55.0 million, primarily for certain insurance programs.
At February28, 2009, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million each. These uncommitted lines of credit were utilized for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. During fiscal 2008, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of February28, 2009, there was approximately $7.1 million of outstanding letters of credit and approximately $45.5 million of outstanding unsecured standby letters of credit, primarily for certain insurance programs.
5.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company adopted the accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures for financial assets and liabilities on March2, 2008 and for non-financial assets and liabilities on March1, 2009. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The adoption of this guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches, including quoted market prices and discounted cash flows. The guidance also established a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect a companys judgment concerning the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available under the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows: 39 Table of Contents  Level 1  Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the Company is able to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
Level 2  Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar, or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
Level 3  Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
As of February27, 2010, the Companys financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputs include long term investment securities traded on active securities exchanges. The Company did not have any financial assets utilizing Level 2 inputs. Financial assets utilizing Level 3 inputs included short term and long term investments in auction rate securities consisting of preferred shares of closed end municipal bond funds and securities collateralized by student loans, and a related put option (See Investment Securities, Note 6).
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the Companys degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset or liability must be classified in its entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value.
Valuation techniques used by the Company must be consistent with at least one of the three possible approaches: the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach. The Companys Level 1 valuations are based on the market approach and consist primarily of quoted prices for identical items on active securities exchanges. The Companys Level 3 valuations of auction rate securities are based on the income approach, specifically, discounted cash flow analyses which utilize significant inputs based on the Companys estimates and assumptions. Inputs include current coupon rates and expected maturity dates.
The following table presents the valuation of the Companys financial assets as of February27, 2010 measured at fair value on a recurring basis by input level: Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets Significant Unobservable Inputs (in millions) (Level 1) (Level 3) Total Short   term - available-for-sale securities: Auction   rate securities $  $ 15.0 $ 15.0 Short   term - trading securities: Auction   rate securities  40.5 40.5 Short   term - put option  2.3 2.3 Long   term - available-for-sale securities: Auction   rate securities  120.8 120.8 Long   term - trading securities: Nonqualified   deferred compensation plan assets 12.1  12.1 Total $ 12.1 $ 178.6 $ 190.7 40 Table of Contents The following table presents the changes in the Companys financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) : (in millions) Auction Rate Securities Put Option Total Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Balance   on February28, 2009, net of temporary valuation adjustment $ 212.8 $ 1.8 $ 214.6 Change   in temporary valuation adjustment included in accumulated other comprehensive   income (loss) 0.5  0.5 Unrealized   loss included in earnings (1) (0.5 )  (0.5 ) Change   in valuation of Put Option  0.5 0.5 Redemptions   at par (36.5 )  (36.5 ) Balance   on February27, 2010, net of temporary valuation adjustment $ 176.3 $ 2.3 $ 178.6 (1)Represents the amount of total losses for the period included in earnings relating to assets still held on February27, 2010.
Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2009 through April22, 2010, the Company additionally redeemed approximately $14.1 million of short term available-for-sale securities at par.
6.
INVESTMENT SECURITIES The Companys investment securities as of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009 are as follows: (in millions) February27, 2010 February28, 2009 Available-for-sale   securities: Short   term $ 15.0 $ 2.0 Long   term 120.8 171.4 Trading   securities: Short   term 40.5  Long   term 12.1 47.8 Held-to-maturity   securities: Short   term 373.6  Long   term  0.1 Put   option: Short   term 2.3  Long   term  1.8 Total   investment securities $ 564.3 $ 223.1 Auction Rate Securities As of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, the Companys available-for-sale investment securities represented approximately $137.9 million and approximately $176.0 million par value of auction rate securities, respectively, less temporary valuation adjustments of approximately $2.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Since these valuation adjustments are deemed to be temporary, they are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Companys earnings. These securities at par are invested in preferred shares of closed end municipal bond funds, which are required, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, to maintain minimum asset coverage ratios of 200%. All of these available-for-sale investments carried triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies as of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, and none of them are mortgage-backed debt obligations. The Company believes that the unrealized losses are temporary and reflect the investments current lack of liquidity. As of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, the Companys available-for-sale investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. Due to their lack of liquidity, 41 Table of Contents the Company classified $120.8 million and $171.4 million of these investments as long term investment securities at February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, respectively. In addition, the Company classified approximately $15.0 million of these securities as short term investment securities at February27, 2010 due to expected redemptions at par during the first half of fiscal 2010.
As of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, the Companys trading investment securities included approximately $40.5 million at fair value ($42.8 million at par) and $41.4 million at fair value ($43.2 million at par), respectively, of auction rate securities which are invested in securities collateralized by student loans. As of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, these securities were more than 100% collateralized with approximately 90% of such collateral in the aggregate being guaranteed by the United States government. All of these trading investment securities also carried triple-A ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies as of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009. During fiscal 2009, the Company recognized a pre-tax unrealized loss of approximately $0.5 million in the consolidated statement of earnings to reflect the decrease in the fair value of these securities. In fiscal 2008, the Company entered into an agreement (the Agreement) with the investment firm that sold the Company these securities. By entering into the Agreement, the Company (1)received the right (Put Option) to sell these auction rate securities back to the investment firm at par, at its sole discretion, anytime during the period from June30, 2010 through July2, 2012, and (2)gave the investment firm the right to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on the Companys behalf at par anytime after the execution of the Agreement through July2, 2012. The Company elected to measure the Put Option at fair value and recorded it as a long term investment. As of February27, 2010, the fair value of the Put Option was approximately $2.3 million and during fiscal 2009, the Company recorded pre-tax income of approximately $0.5 million to reflect the increase in its fair value. The recording of the change in fair value of the Put Option and these securities resulted in no net impact to the consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal 2009. The Company anticipates that any future changes in the fair value of the Put Option will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related auction rate securities with no material impact to the consolidated statement of earnings.
Because the Company intends to exercise its Put Option right as soon as practicably possible during fiscal 2010, these securities of $40.5 million and the related Put Option of $2.3 million were classified as short term investment securities as of February27, 2010.
During fiscal 2009 and 2008, approximately $38.5 million and $107.6 million, respectively, of auction rate securities were redeemed at par. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2009 through April22, 2010, the Company additionally redeemed approximately $14.1 million of short term available-for-sale securities at par.
U.S. Treasury Securities As of February27, 2010, the Companys short term held-to-maturity securities included approximately $373.6 million of U.S. Treasury Bills with remaining maturities of less than one year. These securities are stated at their amortized cost which approximates fair value.
Other trading investment securities The Companys other trading investment securities, which are provided as investment options to the participants of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, are stated at fair market value. The values of these trading investment securities included in the table above are approximately $12.1 million and $6.4 million as of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, respectively.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows: FISCAL YEAR ENDED (in thousands) February27, 2010 February28, 2009 March1, 2008 Current: Federal $ 346,875 $ 233,216 $ 276,986 State and local 61,080 47,294 23,123 407,955 280,510 300,109 Deferred: Federal (17,851 ) (19,419 ) 5,483 State and local (4,882 ) (2,906 ) (3,168 ) (22,733 ) (22,325 ) 2,315 $ 385,222 $ 258,185 $ 302,424 At February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, included in other current assets and in other assets is a net current deferred income tax asset of $167.2 million and $145.8 million, respectively, and a net noncurrent deferred income tax asset of $96.6 million and $96.2 million, respectively. These amounts represent the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following: February27, February28, (in thousands) 2010 2009 Deferred tax assets: Inventories $ 34,659 $ 23,904 Deferred rent and other rent credits 64,707 59,785 Insurance 44,386 40,198 Stock-based compensation 60,994 65,081 Merchandise credits and gift card liabilities 27,409 33,539 Accrued expenses 64,388 57,113 Other 25,543 17,637 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation (15,593 ) (20,841 ) Goodwill (25,648 ) (20,502 ) Other (17,000 ) (13,918 ) $ 263,845 $ 241,996 The Company has not established a valuation allowance for the net deferred tax asset as it is considered more likely than not that it is realizable through a combination of future taxable income, the deductibility of future net deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies.
The Company adopted updated accounting guidance related to income taxes on March4, 2007 (Adoption Date). This guidance addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than 43 Table of Contents not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities. This guidance also provided direction on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.
Upon adoption of this accounting guidance, the Company recognized a $13.1 million increase to retained earnings to reflect the change to its liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits as required. The Company also recorded additional gross unrecognized tax benefits, and corresponding higher deferred tax assets, of $35.6 million as a result of the adoption. At March4, 2007 the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $163.3 million, of which $119.9 million would impact the Companys effective tax rate. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. As of March4, 2007, the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits included approximately $27.5 million of accrued interest.
The following table summarizes the activity related to the gross unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions: February27, February28, (in thousands) 2010 2009 Balance at beginning of year $ 96,697 $ 83,139 Increase related to current year positions 17,993 13,790 Increase related to prior year positions 31,904 8,962 Decrease related to prior year positions (31,949 ) (5,249 ) Settlements (26 ) (2,843 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (1,533 ) (1,102 ) Balance at end of year $ 113,086 $ 96,697 At February27, 2010, the Company has recorded approximately $9.7 million and $103.4 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits in current and non-current taxes payable, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet of which approximately $107.8 million would impact the Companys effective tax rate. At February28, 2009, the Company has recorded approximately $8.5 million and $88.2 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits in current and non-current taxes payable, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet of which approximately $89.3 million would impact the Companys effective tax rate. As of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits included approximately $21.6 million and $18.2 million, respectively, of accrued interest. The Company recorded an increase of interest of approximately $6.1 million and $4.6 million for the years ended February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, respectively, for gross unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated statement of earnings.
The Company anticipates that any adjustments to gross unrecognized tax benefits which will impact income tax expense, due to the settlement of audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations, will not exceed $1.6 million in the next twelve months. However, actual results could differ from those currently anticipated.
As of February27, 2010, the Company operated in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada and files income tax returns in the United States and various state, local and international jurisdictions. The Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2001 through 2008.

13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company measures all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and records such expense in its consolidated financial statements. Currently, the Companys stock-based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards.
Stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended February27, 2010, February28, 2009 and March1, 2008 was approximately $44.2 million ($26.9 million after tax or $0.10 per diluted share), approximately $43.7 million ($27.2 million after tax or $0.11 per diluted share) and approximately $43.8 million ($28.4 million after tax or $0.11 per diluted share), respectively.

Incentive Compensation Plans The Company currently grants awards under the Bed Bath& Beyond 2004 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2004 Plan). The 2004 Plan is a flexible compensation plan that enables the Company to offer incentive compensation through stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights and performance awards, including cash awards. Under the 2004 Plan, grants are determined by the Compensation Committee for those awards granted to executive officers and by an appropriate committee for all other awards granted. Awards of stock options and restricted stock generally vest in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant.
Prior to fiscal 2004, the Company had adopted various stock option plans (the Prior Plans), all of which solely provided for the granting of stock options. Upon adoption of the 2004 Plan, the common stock available under the Prior Plans become available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. No further option grants may be made under the Prior Plans, although outstanding awards under the Prior Plans will continue to be in effect.
Under the 2004 Plan and the Prior Plans, an aggregate of 83.4 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance. The Company generally issues new shares for stock option exercises and restricted stock awards. As of February27, 2010, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Companys stock options and restricted stock awards was $25.9 million and $96.9 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years and 4.3 years, respectively.
Stock Options Stock option grants are issued at fair market value on the date of grant and generally become exercisable in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant. Option grants for stock options issued prior to May10, 2004 expire ten years after the date of grant. Option grants for stock options issued since May10, 2004 expire eight years after the date of grant.
47 Table of Contents All option grants are nonqualified.
The fair value of the stock options granted was estimated on the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table.
FISCAL YEAR ENDED Black-Scholes Valuation Assumptions (1) February27, 2010 February28, 2009 March1, 2008 Weighted   Average Expected Life (in years) (2) 6.3 6.1 6.4 Weighted   Average Expected Volatility (3) 40.39 % 34.13 % 25.00 % Weighted   Average Risk Free Interest Rates (4) 2.45 % 3.17 % 4.58 % Expected   Dividend Yield    (1)Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.
(2)The expected life of stock options is estimated based on historical experience.
(3)Commencing with fiscal 2008, the Company changed its methodology for expected volatility to be based on the average of historical and implied volatility. In changing its methodology, the Company considered, among other factors, the current events affecting the market environment at the date of grant and consistency by utilizing implied volatility as a component of its current methodology. The Company believes this approach more closely reflects what marketplace participants would likely use when considering the market environment to determine the expected volatility for the Companys stock options (which vest over 3-7 years) on the date of grant. The historical volatility is determined by observing actual prices of the Companys stock over a period commensurate with the expected life of the awards. The implied volatility represents the implied volatility of the Companys call options, which are actively traded on multiple exchanges, had remaining maturities in excess of twelve months, had market prices close to the exercise prices of the employee stock options and were measured on the stock option grant date. For fiscal 2007, the expected volatility was based solely on the implied volatility of the Companys call options, which had the same attributes as described above.
(4)Based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options.
Changes in the Companys stock options for the fiscal year ended February27, 2010 were as follows: (Shares in   thousands) Number of Stock Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Options   outstanding, beginning of period 17,482 $ 32.41 Granted 733 28.33 Exercised (4,503 ) 22.12 Forfeited or   expired (255 ) 33.15 Options   outstanding, end of period 13,457 $ 35.62 Options   exercisable, end of period 10,116 $ 35.82 The weighted average fair value for the stock options granted in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $12.33, $12.95 and $15.07, respectively. The weighted average remaining contractual term and the aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding as of February27, 2010 was 3.2 years and $80.9 million, respectively. The weighted average remaining contractual term and the aggregate intrinsic value for options exercisable as of February27, 2010 was 2.7 years and $58.6 million, respectively. The total intrinsic values for stock options exercised during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $61.9 million, $20.4 million and $28.2 million, respectively.
48 Table of Contents Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options for fiscal 2009 were $99.7 million and the associated income tax benefits were $0.3 million.
Restricted Stock Restricted stock awards are issued and measured at fair market value on the date of grant and generally become exercisable in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant. Vesting of restricted stock awarded to certain of the Companys executives is dependent on the Companys achievement of a performance-based test for the fiscal year of grant, and assuming achievement of the performance-based test, time vesting, subject, in general, to the executive remaining in the Companys employ on specified vesting dates. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to these awards based on the assumption that the performance-based test will be achieved. Vesting of restricted stock awarded to the Companys other employees is based solely on time vesting.
Changes in the Companys restricted stock for the fiscal year ended February27, 2010 were as follows: (Shares in   thousands) Number of Restricted Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested   restricted stock, beginning of period 3,624 $ 35.79 Granted 1,510 28.93 Vested (547 ) 36.11 Forfeited (141 ) 33.64 Unvested   restricted stock, end of period 4,446 $ 33.49 14.

49 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February27, 2010. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February27, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has, in the fiscal year ended February28, 2009, changed its methods of accounting for the fair value option for certain financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements, and in the fiscal year ended March1, 2008, changed its method of recognizing and measuring the tax effects related to uncertain tax positions, each due to the adoption of new accounting requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of February27, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated April27, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
/s/   KPMG LLP Short   Hills, New Jersey April27,   2010 50 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Shareholders Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.: We have audited Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of February27, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, appearing in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February27, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February27, 2010 and February28, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity and cash flows and the related financial statement schedule for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February27, 2010, and our report dated April27, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and the related financial statement schedule.
/s/   KPMG LLP Short Hills, New Jersey April27, 2010 51 Table of Contents ITEM 9 - CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None.
ITEM 9A - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a)Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on their evaluation as of February27, 2010, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules13a-15(e)and 15d-15(e)under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by our management in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i)recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rulesand forms and (ii)accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b)Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f)under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February27, 2010. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of February27, 2010, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.
(c)Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm KPMG LLP issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
(d)Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended February27, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide such reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the Companys Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.
