The Companys fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest February28. Accordingly, fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 represented 52 weeks and ended on February25, 2006, February26, 2005 and February28, 2004, respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to periods of time (e.g., quarters and years) are to fiscal periods.
ITEM 1 - BUSINESS Introduction Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a nationwide chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath& Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS) and Harmon. The Company sells a wide assortment of merchandise principally including domestics merchandise and home furnishings as well as food, giftware and health and beauty care items. The Company believes that it is the nations largest operator of stores selling predominantly domestics merchandise and home furnishings while offering a breadth and depth of selection in most of its product categories that exceeds what is generally available in department stores or other specialty retail stores.
History The Company was founded in 1971 by Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg, the Co-Chairmen of the Company. Each has more than 45 years of experience in the retail industry.
The Company commenced operations in 1971 with the opening of two stores, which primarily sold bed linens and bath accessories. In 1985, the Company introduced its first store carrying a full line of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. The Company began using the name Bed Bath& Beyond in 1987 in order to reflect the expanded product line offered by its stores and to distinguish its stores from conventional specialty retail stores offering only domestics merchandise or home furnishings. In June2003, the Company acquired CTS, a retailer of giftware and household items, which operated 23 stores located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island. In March2002, the Company acquired Harmon, a health and beauty care retailer, which operated 27 stores located in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.
Operations It is the Companys goal to offer quality merchandise at everyday low prices; to maintain a wide assortment of merchandise; to present merchandise in a distinctive manner designed to maximize customer convenience and reinforce customer perception of wide selection; and to emphasize dedication to customer service and satisfaction.
Pricing.
The Company believes in maintaining everyday low prices. The Company regularly monitors price levels at its competitors in order to ensure that its prices are in accordance with its pricing philosophy. The Company believes that the application of its everyday low price philosophy is an important factor in establishing its reputation among customers.
Merchandise Assortment.
The Company sells a wide assortment of merchandise principally including domestics merchandise and home furnishings as well as food, giftware and health and beauty care items. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings includes categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares and general home furnishings. The Company encourages local store personnel to tailor the merchandise mix as appropriate to respond to changing trends and conditions. The factors taken into account in selecting the merchandise mix for a particular store include store size and configuration and local market conditions such as climate and demographics. The Company, on an ongoing basis, tests new merchandise 3 categories and adjusts the categories of merchandise carried in its stores and mayadd new departments or adjust the size of existing departments as required. Additionally, the Company continues to integrate the merchandise assortments within its concepts. The Company believes that the process of adding new departments, integrating the Companys merchandise within concepts, and expanding or reducing the size of various departments in response to changing conditions is an important partof its merchandising strategy.
Merchandise Presentation.
BBB has developed a distinctive style of merchandise presentation. Primarily all of the stores have groups of related product lines presented together in separate areas of each store, creating the appearance that the store is comprised of several individual specialty stores for different product lines. BBB believes that its format of merchandise presentation makes it easy for customers to locate products, reinforces customer perception of wide selection and communicates to customers that its stores offer a level of customer service generally associated with smaller specialty stores.
BBB believes that its extensive merchandise selection, rather than fixturing, should be the focus of customer attention and, accordingly, typically uses simple modular fixturing throughout its stores. This fixturing is primarily designed so that it can be easily reconfigured to adapt to changes in the stores merchandise mix and presentation. BBB believes that its merchandise displays create an exciting and attractive shopping environment that encourages impulse purchases of additional items.
Advertising.
In general, the Company relies on word of mouth advertising and its reputation for offering a wide assortment of quality merchandise at everyday low prices, supplemented by the use of paid advertising. The Company distributes full-color circulars and other advertising pieces as its primary vehicles of paid advertising. Also, to support the opening of new stores, the Company primarily uses grand opening circulars and newspaper advertising.
Customer Service.
The Company places a strong focus on customer service and seeks to make shopping at its stores as pleasant and convenient as possible. Most stores are open seven days (and six evenings) a week in order to enable customers to shop at times that are convenient for them. In addition, the Companys websites, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, www.christmastreeshops.com and www.harmondiscount.com are available for customers to access 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Suppliers The Company purchases its merchandise from approximately 4,300 suppliers. In fiscal 2005, the Companys largest supplier accounted for approximately 4% of the Companys merchandise purchases and the Companys 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 18% of such purchases. The Company purchases substantially all of its merchandise in the United States, the majority from domestic sources and the balance from importers. The Company purchases a small amount of its merchandise directly from overseas sources. The Company has no long-term contracts for the purchase of merchandise. The Company believes that most merchandise, other than brand name goods, is available from a variety of sources and that most brand name goods can be replaced with comparable merchandise.
Warehousing The Companys merchandise displays allow a substantial amount of merchandise to be displayed on the sales floor at all times. Merchandise not displayed on the sales floor is typically stored in warehouse space within the store. In addition, the Company maintains twelve supplemental storage locations as well as two central distribution centers. Merchandise is shipped directly to stores from vendors through a network of third party carriers, service providers and the central distribution centers.
In addition, the Company maintains two E-Service fulfillment centers.
4 Employees As of February25, 2006, the Company employed approximately 33,000 persons in full-time and part-time positions. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are very good and that the labor turnover rate among its management employees is lower than that generally experienced within the industry.
Seasonality The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in August, Novemberand December, and generally lower in Februaryand April.
Expansion Program The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets and the expansion or relocation of existing stores. In the fourteen year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2005, the Company has grown from 34 stores to 809 stores. The Companys 809 stores operate in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, including: 742 BBB stores operating in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 29 CTS stores operating in 8 states; and 38 Harmon stores operating in 3 states. Total square footage grew from approximately 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to approximately 25.5 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, the Company opened 83 BBB stores, three CTS stores and four Harmon stores, and closed one BBB store and one Harmon store, which resulted in the aggregate addition of approximately 2.6 million square feet of store space.
The Company intends to continue its expansion program and believes that the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, on the success of this program. As partof its expansion program, the Company expects to open new stores and expand existing stores as opportunities arise.
In determining where to open new stores, the Company evaluates a number of factors, including the availability of real estate, demographic information (such as data relating to income and education levels, age and occupation) and distribution. The Company has built its management structure with a view toward its expansion and believes that, as a result, it has the management depth necessary to support its anticipated expansion program.
Inflation The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future.
Competition The Company believes it is the preeminent retailer in its segment of the home goods industry, which is fragmented and highly competitive. In addition, the stores compete with many different types of retail stores that sell many or most of the same products. Such competitors include: (i)department stores, which often carry many of the same product lines as the Companys stores but do not typically have the same depth or breadth of product selection, (ii)specialty stores, which often have a depth of product selection but typically carry only a limited portion of the product lines carried by the Companys stores, (iii)discount and mass merchandise stores and (iv)national chains. In addition, the Companys stores compete, to a more limited extent, with factory outlet stores that typically offer limited quantities or limited lines of quality merchandise at discount prices.
The visibility of the Company has encouraged competitors to imitate its stores format and methods. Other retail chains continue to introduce new store concepts that include many of the product lines carried by the Companys stores. There can be no assurance that the operation of store competitors will not have a material effect on the Company.
5 Tradenames and Service Marks The Company uses the nationally recognized Bed Bath& Beyond name and logo and the Beyond any store of its kind tag line as service marks in connection with retail services. The Company has registered these marks and others, including names and logos of CTS and Harmon, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company also has registered or has applications pending with the trademark registries of several foreign countries. Management believes that its name recognition and service marks are important elements of the Companys merchandising strategy.
Available Information The Company makes available as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), free of charge, through its website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, the Companys annual reports on Form10-K, quarterly reports on Form10-Q, current reports on Form8-K, and amendments to those reports, electronically filed or furnished pursuant to Section13(a) or 15(d)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

7 ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form10-K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition maydiffer materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements as a result of many factors that maybe outside the Companys control. Such factors include the following: Consumer Preferences and Demographic Factors The Companys success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing merchandise trends, customer demands and demographics. The Companys failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in customer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could lead to, among other things, excess inventories or a shortage of products and could have a material adverse affect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.
General Economic Conditions General economic factors that are beyond the Companys control impact the Companys forecasts and actual performance. These factors include interest rates, recession, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, fuel and energy costs, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, and other matters that influence consumer spending. Changes in the economic climate could adversely affect the Companys performance.
Unusual Weather Patterns The Companys operating results could be negatively impacted by unusual weather patterns. Frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms, hurricanes, floods, tornados or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect the Companys performance.
Competition and Pricing Pressures The retail business is highly competitive. The Company competes for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of the business with many other local, regional and national retailers. Those competitors range from specialty retail stores to department stores and discounters. Unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of those competitors mayadversely affect the Companys performance.
Cost of Labor, Merchandise and Other Expenses The Companys success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and to look for opportunities to reduce costs. The Companys ability to meet its labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. The Companys ability to find qualified vendors and obtain access to products in a timely and efficient manner can be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers noncompliance with applicable laws, transportation costs and other factors beyond the Companys control.
Expansion Program The Companys growth depends, in part, on our ability to open new stores and operate profitably. Our ability to open additional stores successfully will depend on a number of factors, including our identification and availability of suitable store locations; our success in negotiating leases on acceptable terms; our hiring and training of skilled store operating personnel, especially management; and our timely development of new stores, including the 8 availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction and other delays in store openings based on weather or other events. In addition, as our business continues to grow, we are subject to more complex state and federal regulations and maybe the target of private actions alleging violations of such regulations. This increases the cost of doing business and the risk that our business practices could result in liabilities that mayadversely affect the Companys performance, despite the exercise of reasonable care.
ITEM 1B  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES Most of the Companys stores are located in suburban areas of medium and large-sized cities. These stores are situated in strip and power strip shopping centers, as well as in major off-price and conventional malls, and in free standing buildings.

13 ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a nationwide chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath& Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS) and Harmon. The Company sells a wide assortment of merchandise principally including domestics merchandise and home furnishings as well as food, giftware and health and beauty care items. The Companys objective is to be a customers first choice for products and services in the categories offered, in the markets in which the Company operates.
The Companys strategy is to achieve this objective through excellent customer service, an extensive breadth and depth of assortment, everyday low prices, introduction of new merchandising offerings and development of its infrastructure.
Operating in the highly competitive retail industry, the Company, along with other retail companies, is influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences and spending habits, general economic conditions, unusual weather patterns, competition from existing and potential competitors, and the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program.
In fiscal 2005, the Companys consolidated net sales increased by 12.9% and net earnings increased by 13.4% .
Contributing to this increase was the expansion of store space by 11.1%, from 22,945,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2004 to 25,502,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2005. The 2,557,000 square feet increase was primarily the result of opening 83 BBB stores, three CTS stores and four Harmon stores.
Comparable store sales for fiscal 2005 increased by approximately 4.6% as compared with an increase of approximately 4.5% and 6.3% in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of the beginning of the fiscal third quarter of 2004, CTS was included in the calculation of comparable store sales. The fiscal 2005 increase in comparable store sales reflected a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings and a strong focus on customer service with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback.
A store is considered a comparable store when it has been open for twelve full months following its grand opening period (typically four to six weeks). Stores relocated or expanded are excluded from comparable store sales if the change in square footage would cause meaningful disparity in sales over the prior period. In the case of a store to be closed, such stores sales are not considered comparable once the store closing process has commenced.
The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long-term objectives. The Companys fiscal 2006 store opening program is expected to include approximately 80 BBB stores, six CTS stores and the continuing development of its Harmon concept. The Companys new store openings are expected to add approximately 2.5 million square feet of store space.
Fiscal 2006 will be a 53 week period ending March3, 2007.
14 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated (i)selected statement of earnings data of the Company expressed as a percentage of net sales and (ii)the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of earnings data: FiscalYearEnded Percentage PercentageChange ofNetSales fromPriorYear February25, February26, February28, February25, February26, 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 12.9 % 15.0 % Cost of   sales 57.2 57.5 58.1 12.2 13.8 Gross profit 42.8 42.5 41.9 13.7 16.5 Selling,   general and administrative expenses 27.7 27.1 27.6 15.3 12.7 Operating   profit 15.1 15.4 14.3 10.9 23.9 Earnings   before provision for income taxes 15.8 15.8 14.5 12.8 24.9 Net earnings 9.9 9.8 8.9 13.4 26.4 Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2005 increased $661.9 million to $5.810 billion, representing an increase of 12.9% over the $5.148 billion of net sales in fiscal 2004, which increased $669.7 million or 15.0% over net sales of $4.478 billion in fiscal 2003. Approximately 64% of the increase in fiscal 2005 was attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales, and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in comparable store sales. The increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2005 of 4.6% was due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings and a strong focus on customer service with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback. For fiscal 2004, approximately 56% of the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in the Companys new store sales, approximately 15% of the increase was attributable to the net sales of CTS (acquired on June19, 2003) and the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in comparable store sales.
Sales of domestics merchandise accounted for approximately 47%, 48% and 51% of net sales in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, of which the Company estimates that bed linens accounted for approximately 16%, 17% and 16% of net sales in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The remaining net sales in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 of 53%, 52% and 49%, respectively, represented sales of home furnishings and other items. The change in the product mix between fiscal 2004 and 2003 is primarily the result of the acquisition of CTS in June2003. No other individual product category accounted for 10% or more of net sales during fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003.
Gross Profit Gross profit in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $2.486 billion or 42.8% of net sales, $2.186 billion or 42.5% of net sales and $1.877 billion or 41.9% of net sales, respectively. The increase in gross profit between fiscal 2005 and 2004 and between fiscal 2004 and 2003 as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to lower inventory acquisition costs of the Companys current merchandise offerings.
15 Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $1.607 billion or 27.7% of net sales in fiscal 2005 compared to $1.394 billion or 27.1% of net sales in fiscal 2004. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to the expensing of stock options and related changes in the compensation program, reflecting the early adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No.123R) .
SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased to 27.1% in fiscal 2004 from 27.6% in fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of a relative decrease in payroll and payroll related items, occupancy costs and other expenses, which primarily resulted from the comparable store sales increase. These relative decreases were partially offset by a relative increase in net advertising costs. SG&A in fiscal 2004 was $1.394 billion as compared to $1.237 billion in fiscal 2003.
Operating Profit Operating profit increased to $879.2 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $792.4 million in fiscal 2004. The improvements in operating profit were a result of the increase in net sales and a relative increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales partially offset by a relative increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, as discussed above.
Operating profit increased to $792.4 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $639.3 million in fiscal 2003. The improvements in operating profit were a result of the increase in net sales and a relative increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales and a relative decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, as discussed above.
Interest income Interest income increased to $35.9 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $18.8 million in fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in the Companys average investment interest rate as a result of the upward trend in short term interest rates. Interest income increased in fiscal 2004 from $10.2 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to an increase in the cash invested and an increase in the Companys average investment interest rate as a result of the upward trend in short term interest rates.
Income taxes The effective tax rate was 37.40% for fiscal 2005, 37.75% for fiscal 2004 and 38.50% for fiscal 2003. The decreases are primarily due to a reduction in the weighted average effective tax rate resulting from a change in the mix of the business within the taxable jurisdictions in which the Company operates. For fiscal 2006, the effective tax rate is estimated at approximately 36.60%.
EXPANSION PROGRAM The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets and the expansion or relocation of existing stores. In the fourteen year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2005, the chain has grown from 34 to 809 stores. Total square footage grew from 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to 25,502,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2005.
The Company intends to continue its expansion program and currently plans to open new stores in fiscal 2006 (see details under Liquidity and Capital Resources below). The Company believes that a predominant portion of any increase in its net sales in fiscal 2006 will continue to be attributable to new store net sales. Accordingly, the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, upon the Companys ability to execute its expansion program successfully.
16 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company has been able to finance its operations, including its expansion program, through internally generated funds. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 was $660.4 million, compared with $607.0 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income and the timing of certain liability payments, partially offset by an increase in other current assets (primarily due to receivables from the settlement of credit card litigation and hurricane related insurance claims), an increase in merchandise inventories (primarily the result of new store space) and an increase in income taxes paid.
Inventory per square foot was $51.04 as of February25, 2006 and $50.21 as of February26, 2005. The Company continues to focus on optimizing inventory productivity while maintaining appropriate in-store merchandise levels to support sales growth.
Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2005 was $67.6 million, compared with $353.7 million in fiscal 2004. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was attributable to a decrease in purchases of investment securities partially offset by a decrease in redemptions of investment securities and an increase in capital expenditures.
Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2005 was $567.3 million, compared with $325.7 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to common stock repurchased of $598 million in the current year compared to $350 million in the prior year under the Companys stock repurchase program.
At February25, 2006, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $100 million and $75 million, with expiration dates of September3, 2006 and February28, 2006, respectively. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently and are expected to be used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. In addition, under these uncommitted lines of credit, the Company can obtain unsecured standby letters of credit. During fiscal 2005, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of February25, 2006, there was approximately $11.5 million of outstanding letters of credit and approximately $33.7 million of outstanding unsecured standby letters of credit, primarily for certain insurance programs. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2005, the Company extended the $75 million uncommitted line of credit to February28, 2007. Although no assurances can be provided, the Company intends to renew the $100 million uncommitted line of credit before the expiration date. The Company believes that during fiscal 2006, internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund its operations, including its expansion program.
The Company has contractual obligations consisting mainly of operating leases for stores, offices, warehouse facilities and equipment, purchase obligations and deferred acquisition payments which the Company is obligated to pay as of February25, 2006 as follows: Lessthan1 After5 (inthousands) Total year 1-3years 4-5years years Operating   Lease Obligations $ 3,067,143 $ 340,806 $ 687,529 $ 617,538 $ 1,421,270 Purchase   Obligations 415,513 415,513    Deferred   Acquisition Payments 6,667 6,667    Total   Contractual Obligations $ 3,489,323 $ 762,986 $ 687,529 $ 617,538 $ 1,421,270 As of February25, 2006, the Company has leased sites for 56 new stores planned for opening in fiscal 2006 or 2007, for which aggregate minimum rental payments over the term of the leases are approximately $355.7 million and are included in the table above.
17 Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise and capital expenditures.
Other significant commitments and contingencies include the following:  The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability.
Some of the Companys operating lease agreements have scheduled rent increases. The Company accounts for these scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term, beginning when the Company obtains possession of the premises, thus creating deferred rent.
Subsequent to fiscal 2005, the Company purchased the Union, New Jersey corporate office location.
SEASONALITY The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in August, Novemberand December, and generally lower in Februaryand April.
INFLATION The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No.123R which requires companies to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No.123R requires additional accounting and disclosure related to income tax and cash flow effects resulting from stock-based compensation. The Company adopted SFAS No.123R on August28, 2005 (the date of adoption), the beginning of its third quarter of fiscal 2005, the year ended February25, 2006. While SFAS No.123R is not required to be effective until the first annual reporting period that begins after June15, 2005, early adoption was encouraged and the Company elected to adopt before the required effective date.
The Company adopted SFAS No.123R under the modified prospective application. Under this application, prior period amounts are not restated to include the effects of stock-based compensation. As a result, certain components of the Companys financial statements will not be comparable until the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the anniversary of the adoption of SFAS No.123R. The Company will continue to comply with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.123R, which include the effect on net earnings and earnings per share as reported and as if compensation expense had been recorded for the comparable periods reported, respectively. The impact of recording stock-based compensation expense and other changes made to the Companys overall compensation plan was approximately $0.06 per diluted share for fiscal 2005. The Company estimates the impact will be approximately $0.06 per diluted share for the first half of fiscal 2006.
Also under the modified prospective application, the Company records stock-based compensation expense for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption and for the portion of previously granted awards that remained unvested at the date of adoption. Currently, the Companys stock-based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards as defined under SFAS No.123R. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company applied the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as permitted under SFAS No.148, Accounting for 18 Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure  an amendment of FASB Statement No.123. During the first half of fiscal 2005, which ended on August27, 2005, the Company recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards over the service period, but did not recognize compensation expense for stock options, since the options were granted at market value on the date of grant.
Stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended February25, 2006, which includes the expense of stock options beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and restricted stock awards from the date of grant, was $25.6 million ($16.0 million after tax or $0.05 per diluted share). The amount of stock-based compensation cost capitalized as of February25, 2006 was approximately $0.9 million.
During fiscal 2004, in anticipation of adopting SFAS No.123R, the Company revised its overall approach to compensation for its employees, including stock-based compensation, and adopted the Bed Bath& Beyond 2004 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2004 Plan). The 2004 Plan is a flexible compensation plan that enables the Company to offer incentive compensation through stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and performance awards, including cash awards. As a result, during fiscal 2005, awards consisting of a combination of stock options and performance-based restricted stock were granted to executive officers and other executives and awards consisting of restricted stock were granted to the Companys other employees who traditionally have received stock options. Awards of stock options and restricted stock generally vest in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant.
Prior to fiscal 2004, the Company had adopted various stock option plans (the Prior Plans), all of which solely provided for the granting of stock options. Upon adoption of the 2004 Plan, the common stock available under the Prior Plans became available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. No further option grants maybe made under the Prior Plans, although outstanding awards under the Prior Plans will continue to be in effect.
Under the 2004 Plan and the Prior Plans, an aggregate of 83.4 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance. The Company generally issues new shares for stock option exercises and restricted stock awards. The number of shares and the price per share is determined by the Compensation Committee for those awards granted to executive officers and by an appropriate committee for all other awards granted.
As of February25, 2006, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Companys stock options and restricted stock awards was $123.1 million and $33.1 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.6 years and 5.2 years, respectively.
In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 13-1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period. FSP 13-1 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense. FSP 13-1 becomes effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of FSP 13-1 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In June 2005, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 05-6, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination. EITF 05-6 requires leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term to be amortized over the shorter of the assets useful life or a term that includes the original lease term plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. This guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after June 29, 2005. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - a replacement of APB No. 20 and SFAS No. 3, which changes the requirements for the accounting for, and reporting of, a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005; however, the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No.154 will have a 19 material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN No. 47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. This interpretation requires companies to recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset-retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN No. 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN No. 47 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversions be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
20 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which formthe basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as the inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, accruals for self insurance, litigation, store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Inventory Valuation : Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB and Harmon are calculated using the retail inventory method and inventory cost for CTS is calculated using the first-in, first-out cost method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.
At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions.
The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year, based on historical shrinkage. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year-end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory count. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets mayexceed their current fair values. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss would be recognized during that period. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the fair value. The Company has not historically had any material impairment of long-lived assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the fair value of the Companys long-lived assets to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets : The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Self Insurance : The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
21 Litigation : The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates, as appropriate. The ultimate resolution of these ongoing matters as a result of future developments could have a material impact on the Companys earnings. The Company cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings.
Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs : Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation: Prior to August28, 2005, the Company accounted for its stock-based compensation plans under the provisions of APB No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as permitted under SFAS No.148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB Statement No.123. During the first half of fiscal 2005, which ended on August27, 2005, the Company recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards over the service period, but did not recognize compensation expense for stock options, since the options were granted at market value on the date of grant.
Effective August28, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No.123R under the modified prospective method. Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated. Under this application, the Company records stock-based compensation expense for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption and for the portion of previously granted awards that remain unvested at the date of adoption. Currently, the Companys stock-based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards as defined under SFAS No.123R.
Under SFAS No.123R, the Company uses a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options. The Black-Scholes model includes various assumptions, including the expected life of stock options, the expected volatility and the expected risk free interest rate. These assumptions reflect the Companys best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of the Company. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, total stock-based compensation cost, as determined in accordance with SFAS No.123R could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if the Company uses different assumptions for future grants, stock-based compensation cost could be materially impacted in future periods.
Also, under SFAS No.123R, the Company is required to record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. The Companys forfeiture rate assumption used in determining its stock-based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data. The actual forfeiture rate could differ from these estimates.
Income Taxes : The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
22 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form10-K and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition maydiffer materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements as a result of many factors that maybe outside the Companys control. Such factors include, without limitation: changes in the retailing environment and consumer preferences and spending habits; demographics and other macroeconomic factors that mayimpact the level of spending for the types of merchandise sold by the Company; general economic conditions; unusual weather patterns; competition from existing and potential competitors; competition from other channels of distribution; pricing pressures; the cost of labor, merchandise and other costs and expenses; and the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program.
23 ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment securities.

27 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and Subsidiaries 1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED MATTERS A.
Nature of Operations Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a nationwide chain of retail stores, operating under the names Bed Bath& Beyond (BBB), Christmas Tree Shops (CTS) and Harmon. The Company sells a wide assortment of merchandise principally including domestics merchandise and home furnishings as well as food, giftware and health and beauty care items. As the Company operates in the retail industry, its results of operations are affected by general economic conditions and consumer spending habits.
B.
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
C.
Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest February28. Accordingly, fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 represented 52 weeks and ended on February25, 2006, February26, 2005 and February28, 2004, respectively.
D.
Segments The Company accounts for its operations as one operating segment.
E.
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which formthe basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, accruals for self insurance, litigation, store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, the provision for sales returns, vendor allowances, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
F.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 13-1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period. FSP 13-1 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense. FSP 13-1 becomes effective for the first reporting period beginning after December15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of FSP 13-1 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
28 In June2005, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No.05-6, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination. EITF 05-6 requires leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term to be amortized over the shorter of the assets useful life or a term that includes the original lease term plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. This guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after June29, 2005. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In May2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - a replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No.20 and SFAS No.3, which changes the requirements for the accounting for, and reporting of, a change in accounting principle. SFAS No.154 is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005; however, the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No.154 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In March2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No.47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN No.47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No.143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. This interpretation requires companies to recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to performasset-retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated. FIN No.47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN No.47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December15, 2005. The adoption of FIN No.47 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.151, Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No.43, Chapter 4. SFAS No.151 amends the guidance to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No.151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversions be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No.151 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
G.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, accounts payable and certain other liabilities. The Companys investment securities consist primarily of held-to-maturity debt securities which are stated at amortized cost and available-for-sale debt securities which are stated at their approximate fair value. The book value of all financial instruments is representative of their fair values with the exception of investment securities (see Note 5  Investment Securities).
H.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Included in cash and cash equivalents are credit and debit card receivables from banks, which typically settle within 5 business days, of $34.9 million and $31.4 million as of February25, 2006 and February26, 2005, respectively.
I.
Investment Securities Investment securities primarily consist of auction rate securities, U.S. Government Agency debt securities and municipal debt securities.
29 Auction rate securities are securities with interest rates that reset periodically through an auction process. Auction rate securities are classified as available-for-sale and are stated at cost or par value which approximates fair value due to interest rates which reset periodically, typically within 28 days. As a result, there are no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains or losses relating to these auction rate securities. All income from these investments is recorded as interest income.
Primarily all other investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until maturity and are stated at amortized cost.
Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted over the life of the security as adjustments to interest income using the effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
J.
Inventory Valuation Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs for BBB and Harmon are calculated using the retail inventory method and inventory cost for CTS is calculated using the first-in, first-out cost method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.
At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to the Companys best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions.
The Company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year, based on historical shrinkage. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year-end based upon the results of the Companys physical inventory count. Historically, the Companys shrinkage has not been volatile.
K.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (forty years for buildings; five to fifteen years for furniture, fixtures and equipment; and three to five years for computer equipment and software). Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful life or the life of the lease.
The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to earnings as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs amounted to $54.2 million, $51.4 million and $44.5 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
L.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets mayexceed their current fair values. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss would be recognized during that period. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the fair value. The Company has not historically had any material impairment of long-lived assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the fair value of the Companys long-lived assets to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
M.
Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values.
30 Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Included within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of February25, 2006 and February26, 2005 is $147.6 million for goodwill and $19.9 million for the tradename of CTS, which are not subject to amortization.
N.
Self Insurance The Company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by its employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that the Company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although the Companys claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if the Company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
O.
Litigation The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates, as appropriate. The ultimate resolution of these ongoing matters as a result of future developments could have a material impact on the Companys earnings. The Company cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future, and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings.
P.
Deferred Rent The Company accounts for scheduled rent increases contained in its leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Historically, the Companys method of accounting defined the beginning of the lease term as the date the Company commenced lease payments. In fiscal 2004, due to clarification by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company changed its method of accounting to define the beginning of the lease term as the date the Company obtained possession of the leased premises. This change in the Companys method of accounting did not have a material impact on the Companys fiscal 2003 and prior consolidated financial statements. Deferred rent amounted to $53.4 million and $42.6 million as of February25, 2006 and February26, 2005, respectively.
Q.
Treasury Stock The Companys Board of Directors has authorized repurchases of shares of its common stock for $200 million in January2006, for $400 million in October2005 and for $350 million in December2004. The Company was authorized to make repurchases from time to time in the open market pursuant to existing rulesand regulations and other parameters approved by the Board of Directors. During fiscal 2005, the Company repurchased approximately 16.4 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $598 million excluding brokerage fees. During fiscal 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 8.8 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $350 million excluding brokerage fees.
31 R.
Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at our retail stores or when shipped for products purchased from our websites. The value of point of sale coupons and point of sale rebates that result in a reduction of the price paid by the customer are recorded as a reduction of sales. Shipping and handling fees that are billed to a customer in a sale transaction are recorded in sales. Revenues from gift cards, gift certificates and merchandise credits are recognized when redeemed.
Sales returns are provided for in the period that the related sales are recorded based on historical experience. Although the estimate for sales returns has not varied materially from historical provisions, actual experience could vary from historical experience in the future if the level of sales return activity changes materially. In the future, if the Company concludes that an adjustment to the sales returns accrual is required due to material changes in the returns activity, the reserve will be adjusted accordingly.
S.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise, buying costs and costs of our distribution network including inbound freight charges, distribution facility costs, receiving costs and internal transfer costs.
T.
Vendor Allowances The Company receives allowances from vendors in the normal course of business for various reasons including direct cooperative advertising, purchase volume and reimbursement for other expenses. Annual terms for each allowance include the basis for earning the allowance and payment terms which vary by agreement. All vendor allowances are recorded as a reduction of inventory cost, except for direct cooperative advertising allowances which are specific, incremental and identifiable. The Company recognizes purchase volume allowances as a reduction of the cost of inventory in the quarter in which milestones are achieved. Advertising costs were reduced by direct cooperative allowances of $9.4 million, $8.7 million and $9.5 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
U.
Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs, including markdowns, asset residual values and projected occupancy costs, are charged to earnings as incurred.
V.
Advertising Costs Expenses associated with store advertising are charged to earnings as incurred. Net advertising costs amounted to $158.2 million, $134.5 million and $93.7 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
W.
Stock-Based Compensation The FASB issued SFAS No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No.123R) which requires companies to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No.123R requires additional accounting and disclosure related to income tax and cash flow effects resulting from stock-based compensation. The Company adopted SFAS No.123R on August28, 2005 (the date of adoption), the beginning of its third 32 quarter of fiscal 2005, the year ended February25, 2006. While SFAS No.123R is not required to be effective until the first annual reporting period that begins after June15, 2005, early adoption was encouraged and the Company elected to adopt before the required effective date.
Under SFAS No.123R, the Company uses a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options. The Black-Scholes model includes various assumptions, including the expected life of stock options, the expected volatility and the expected risk free interest rate. These assumptions reflect the Companys best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of the Company. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, total stock-based compensation cost, as determined in accordance with SFAS No.123R could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if the Company uses different assumptions for future grants, stock-based compensation cost could be materially impacted in future periods.
Also, under SFAS No.123R, the Company is required to record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. The Companys forfeiture rate assumption used in determining its stock-based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data. The actual forfeiture rate could differ from these estimates.
Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company applied the provisions of APB No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as permitted under SFAS No.148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure  an amendment of FASB Statement No.123 and complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123. During the first half of fiscal 2005, which ended on August27, 2005, the Company recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards over the service period, but did not recognize compensation expense for stock options, since the options were granted at market value on the date of grant. No compensation expense for stock-based awards was recognized in fiscal 2004 and 2003.
X. Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return. Income tax returns are filed with each state and territory in which the Company conducts business.
The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Companys tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
Y. Earnings per Share The Company presents earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis. Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding including the dilutive effect of stock-based awards as calculated under the treasury stock method.
Stock-based awards of approximately 4,879,700, 2,766,400 and 543,800 shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
33 Z.
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the fiscal 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial statements to conformto the fiscal 2005 consolidated financial statement presentation.
2.
ACQUISITION On June 19, 2003, the Company acquired CTS. CTS is a retailer of giftware and household items selling a broad assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings at value prices in many categories including home dcor, giftware, housewares, food, paper goods and seasonal products. The results of CTS operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. At the date of acquisition, CTS, headquartered in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts, operated 23 stores in 6 states.
The aggregate all cash purchase price, including the costs of the acquisition, was approximately $194.4 million, net of cash acquired, comprising $175.5 million of cash and $18.9 million in deferred payments payable in cash over three years. Payments of $6.7 million each were made by the Company in June 2005 and June 2004.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION At the beginning of its third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No.123R under the modified prospective application. Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated. Under this application, the Company records stock-based compensation expense for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption and for 39 the portion of previously granted awards that remained unvested at the date of adoption. Currently, the Companys stock-based compensation relates to restricted stock awards and stock options. The Companys restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards as defined under SFAS No.123R.
Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company applied the provisions of APB No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as permitted under SFAS No.148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure  an amendment of FASB Statement No.123. During the first half of fiscal 2005, which ended on August27, 2005, the Company recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards over the service period, but did not recognize compensation expense for stock options, since the options were granted at market value on the date of grant.
The following table details the effect on net earnings and earnings per share as reported and as if compensation expense had been recorded through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2005, in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, based on the fair value method under SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (pro forma).

The amount of stock-based compensation cost capitalized as of February25, 2006 was approximately $0.9 million.
40 Incentive Compensation Plans During fiscal 2004, in anticipation of adopting SFAS No.123R, the Company revised its overall approach to compensation for its employees, including stock-based compensation, and adopted the Bed Bath& Beyond 2004 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2004 Plan). The 2004 Plan is a flexible compensation plan that enables the Company to offer incentive compensation through stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and performance awards, including cash awards. As a result, during fiscal 2005, awards consisting of a combination of stock options and performance-based restricted stock were granted to executive officers and other executives and awards consisting of restricted stock were granted to the Companys other employees who traditionally have received stock options. Awards of stock options and restricted stock generally vest in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant.
Prior to fiscal 2004, the Company had adopted various stock option plans (the Prior Plans), all of which solely provided for the granting of stock options. Upon adoption of the 2004 Plan, the common stock available under the Prior Plans became available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. No further option grants maybe made under the Prior Plans, although outstanding awards under the Prior Plans will continue to be in effect.
Under the 2004 Plan and the Prior Plans, an aggregate of 83.4 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance. The Company generally issues new shares for stock option exercises and restricted stock awards. The number of shares and price per share is determined by the Compensation Committee for those awards granted to executive officers and by an appropriate committee for all other awards granted.
As of February25, 2006, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Companys stock options and restricted stock awards was $123.1 million and $33.1 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.6 years and 5.2 years, respectively.
Stock Options Option grants are issued at market value on the date of grant and generally become exercisable in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the date of grant. Option grants for stock options issued prior to May10, 2004 expire ten years after the date of grant. Option grants for stock options issued since May10, 2004 expire eight years after the date of grant. All option grants are non-qualified. The fair value of the stock options granted was estimated on the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table.

43 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February25, 2006 and February26, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February25, 2006. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and performthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February25, 2006 and February26, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended February25, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of February25, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated May11, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payments.
/s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York May11, 2006 44 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.: We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February25, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and performthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting maynot prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls maybecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures maydeteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February25, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

/s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York May11, 2006 45 ITEM 9 - CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH   ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on their evaluation as of February25, 2006, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules13a-15(e)and 15d-15(e)under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by our management in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i)recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rulesand forms and (ii)accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f)under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February25, 2006. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of February25, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, issued an audit report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended February25, 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide such reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the Companys Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.
