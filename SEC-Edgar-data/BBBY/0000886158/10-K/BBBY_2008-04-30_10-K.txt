The Companys fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest February 28. Accordingly, fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 represented 52 weeks and ended on February 28, 2004, March 1, 2003 and March 2, 2002, respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to periods of time (e.g., quarters and years) are to fiscal periods.
ITEM 1 - BUSINESS Introduction Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. operates specialty retail stores nationwide, including Bed Bath & Beyond stores (BBB), Harmon stores (Harmon) and Christmas Tree Shops stores (CTS). The Company believes it is the nations largest operator of stores selling predominantly better quality domestics merchandise and home furnishings.
BBB stores are almost exclusively of a big box format. BBB offers a wide assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices that are substantially below regular department store prices and generally comparable to or below department store sale prices. BBBs domestics merchandise line includes items such as bed linens, bath accessories and kitchen textiles, and BBBs home furnishings line includes items such as cookware, dinnerware, glassware and basic housewares. BBB believes that it offers a breadth and depth of selection in most of its product categories that exceeds what is generally available in department stores or other specialty retail stores and that this enables it to offer customers the convenience of one-stop shopping for most household items.
As of February 28, 2004, BBB operated 575 stores in 44 states and one territory: Alabama (7), Arizona (9), Arkansas (3), California (67), Colorado (14), Connecticut (10), Delaware (1), Florida (48), Georgia (19), Idaho (3), Illinois (25), Indiana (12), Iowa (5), Kansas (6), Kentucky (4), Louisiana (10), Maine (2), Maryland (13), Massachusetts (10), Michigan (24), Minnesota (8), Mississippi (2), Missouri (10), Nebraska (1), Nevada (5), New Hampshire (4), New Jersey (26), New Mexico (2), New York (31), North Carolina (16), North Dakota (2), Ohio (21), Oklahoma (4), Oregon (7), Pennsylvania (22), Rhode Island (3), South Carolina (10), Tennessee (13), Texas (47), Utah (6), Vermont (1), Virginia (19), Washington (15), Wisconsin (6), and Puerto Rico (2). These stores principally range in size from 20,000 square feet to 50,000 square feet, with some exceeding 80,000 square feet, and carry BBBs full line of both domestics merchandise and home furnishings.
CTS is a retailer of giftware and household items selling a broad assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings at low prices in many categories including home dcor, giftware, housewares, food, paper goods, and seasonal products. As of February 28, 2004, CTS operated 24 stores in 6 states.
Harmon is a health and beauty care retailer, which operated 30 stores in 3 states as of February 28, 2004.
History The Company was founded in 1971 by Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg, the Co-Chairmen of the Company. Each has more than 40 years of experience in the retail industry.
The Company commenced operations in 1971 with the opening of two stores, one in New York and one in New Jersey. These stores sold primarily bed linens and bath accessories. In 1985, the Company introduced its first store carrying a full line of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. The Company began using the name Bed Bath & Beyond in 1987 in order to reflect the expanded product line offered by its stores and to distinguish its stores from conventional specialty retail stores offering only domestics merchandise or home furnishings. In March 2002, the Company entered the health and beauty care market with the acquisition of Harmon and in June 2003, the Company added to its domestics merchandise and home furnishings market offerings with the acquisition of CTS.
3 The Company has been engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new BBB stores (including 85 in fiscal 2003, 95 in fiscal 2002, and 85 in fiscal 2001) and the expansion and relocation of existing BBB stores (including two in fiscal 2003 and two in fiscal 2002). As a result of its expansion program, BBBs store space has increased from approximately 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to approximately 19,353,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2003. The Company intends to continue its expansion program and currently plans to open new BBB, Harmon and CTS stores in fiscal 2004.
Merchandising and Marketing BBBs strategy for merchandising and marketing is to offer better quality merchandise at everyday low prices; to maintain a breadth and depth of selection in its product categories that exceeds what is generally available in department stores or other specialty retail stores; to present merchandise in a distinctive manner designed to maximize customer convenience and reinforce customer perception of wide selection; and to emphasize dedication to customer service and satisfaction.
BBB stores primarily offer domestics merchandise and home furnishings, which include: Domestics Merchandise  bed linens and related items: sheets, comforters, duvet covers, bedspreads, quilts, window treatments (such as curtains and valances), decorative pillows, blankets, dust ruffles, bed pillows and mattress pads.
bath items: towels, shower curtains and liners, waste baskets, mirrors, hampers, robes, slippers, scales, bathroom rugs, wall hardware and other bath accessories.
kitchen textiles: tablecloths, placemats, cloth napkins, dish towels and chair pads.
Home Furnishings  kitchen and tabletop items: cookware, cutlery, kitchen gadgets, dinnerware, bakeware, flatware, drinkware, serveware, glassware, food storage containers, tea kettles, trash cans and cleaning supplies.
fine tabletop and giftware: formal dinnerware china, fine crystal stemware and barware, crystal giftware, metal giftware, flatware, decanters and carafes, and decorative vases and bowls.
basic housewares: storage items, closet-related items (such as hangers, organizers and shoe racks), general housewares (such as brooms, garbage pails and ironing boards), lifestyle accessories (such as lamps, chairs, ready to assemble furniture, furniture covers, accent rugs, and clocks) and small electric appliances (such as blenders, food processors, coffee makers, vacuums, irons, toaster ovens, hair dryers, heaters and humidifiers).
general home furnishings: gift wrap, candles, personal care products (such as soaps, lotions and other health and beauty care items), picture frames, wall art, juvenile items (such as toys and childrens books), artificial plants and flowers and seasonal merchandise (such as summer and holiday-related items).
BBB, on an ongoing basis, tests new merchandise categories and adjusts the categories of merchandise carried in its stores and may add new departments or adjust the size of existing departments as required. BBB believes that the process of adding new departments and expanding or reducing the size of various departments in response to changing conditions is an important part of its merchandising strategy.
BBBs merchandise consists primarily of better quality merchandise typically found at better department stores. For those product lines that have brand names associated with them, BBB generally offers leading brand name merchandise (including Aero, All-Clad, American Pacific, Braun, Calphalon, Cannon, Conair, Croscill, 4 Cuisinart, J.A. Henckels, Homedics, KitchenAid, Krups, Laura Ashley, Lenox, Mikasa, Nambe, Nautica, Nicole Miller, Noritake, Oxo, Portmeirion, Rowenta, Rubbermaid, Springs, Villeroy & Boch, Wamsutta, Wedgewood, Westpoint Stevens and Yankee Candle).
BBB offers a breadth and depth of product selection that enables customers to select among a wide assortment of styles, brands, colors and designs within each of BBBs major product lines. BBB also generally maintains consistent in-stock availability of merchandise in order to reinforce customer perception of wide selection and build customer loyalty.
Pricing Policy BBBs pricing policy is to maintain everyday low prices that are substantially below regular department store prices and generally comparable to or below department store sale prices. BBB regularly monitors price levels at its competitors in order to ensure that BBBs prices are being maintained in accordance with its pricing policy. BBB believes that the application of its everyday low price policy is essential to maintaining the integrity of this policy and is an important factor in establishing its reputation among customers.
Because BBB has an everyday low price policy, BBB does not run sales. However, BBB uses periodic markdowns and semi-annual clearances for merchandise that it has decided to discontinue carrying. In addition, BBBs full-color circulars and mailing pieces include a coupon, which may be redeemed at the point-of-sale. BBB also honors competitor coupons.
Merchandise Presentation BBB has developed a distinctive style of merchandise presentation. In each store, groups of related product lines are presented together in separate areas of the store, creating the appearance that a BBB store is comprised of several individual specialty stores for different product lines. A racetrack layout that runs throughout the store facilitates moving between areas and encourages customers to shop the entire store. BBB believes that its format of merchandise presentation makes it easy for customers to locate products, reinforces customer perception of wide selection and communicates to customers that BBB stores offer a level of customer service generally associated with smaller specialty stores.
Merchandise is displayed in each of these separate areas from floor to ceiling (generally 10 to 14 feet high) and, in addition, seasonal merchandise and impulse items are prominently displayed in the front of the store. BBB believes that its extensive merchandise selection, rather than fixturing, should be the focus of customer attention and, accordingly, typically uses simple modular fixturing throughout the store. This fixturing is designed so that it can be easily reconfigured to adapt to changes in the stores merchandise mix and presentation. BBB believes that its floor to ceiling displays create an exciting and attractive shopping environment that encourages impulse purchases of additional items.
Customer Service The Company places great emphasis on customer service and satisfaction and has made this a defining feature of its corporateculture. All managers provide leadership by example in this area by regularly spending time assisting customers on the selling floor.
The Company seeks to make shopping at its stores as pleasant and convenient as possible. Each area within a BBB store is staffed with knowledgeable sales associates who are available to assist customers in choosing merchandise, to answer questions and to resolve any issues that may arise. In order to make checking out convenient, checkout lines are continually monitored and additional cashiers are added as necessary in order to minimize waiting time. Most BBB stores are open seven days (and six evenings) a week in order to enable 5 customers to shop at times that are convenient for them.
BBBs website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, which customers can generally access 24 hours a day, seven days a week, offers a broad range of online services and features, including online shopping and gift registry. BBB believes that its E-Service efforts have been well received by its customers.
Advertising In general, the Company relies on word of mouth advertising and its reputation for offering a wide assortment of quality merchandise at everyday low prices, supplemented by the use of paid advertising. The Company mails full-color circulars and other advertising pieces as its primary vehicles of paid advertising. Also, to support the opening of new stores, the Company uses grand opening full-color circulars and newspaper advertising. The Company believes that its ability to rely primarily on word of mouth advertising will continue and that its limited use of paid advertising permits it to spend less on advertising than a number of its competitors.
Expansion The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets and the expansion or relocation of existing stores. In the twelve year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2003 the BBB chain has grown from 34 stores to 575 stores. Total BBB square footage grew from approximately 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to approximately 19,353,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2003, BBB opened 85 new stores and relocated two stores which resulted in the addition of approximately 2,098,000 square feet of store space. Harmon has grown from 27 stores, upon acquisition , to 30 stores, with the addition of one store in fiscal 2003, and occupied approximately 204,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2003. CTS has grown from 23 stores, upon acquisition, to 24 stores, with the addition of one store in fiscal 2003, and occupied approximately 915,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2003.
The table below sets forth information concerning BBBs expansion program for the periods indicated: Store   Space Number of   Stores Year Relocated Stores (1) New Stores (2) Closed Stores Beginning of Year End of Year Beginning of Year End of Year (in square   feet) 1992 5 4 0 917,000 1,128,000 34 38 1993 4 9 2 1,128,000 1,512,000 38 45 1994 4 16 0 1,512,000 2,339,000 45 61 1995 2 19 0 2,339,000 3,214,000 61 80 1996 2 28 0 3,214,000 4,347,000 80 108 1997 3 33 0 4,347,000 5,767,000 108 141 1998 3 45 0 5,767,000 7,688,000 141 186 1999 4 55 0 7,688,000 9,815,000 186 241 2000 2 70 0 9,815,000 12,204,000 241 311 2001 0 85 0 12,204,000 14,724,000 311 396 2002 2 95 1 14,724,000 17,255,000 396 490 2003 2 85 0 17,255,000 19,353,000 490 575 (1) A relocated store is an existing store that was either expanded or relocated to a new store in the same area.
(2) Excludes any relocated store.
The Company intends to continue its expansion program and believes that the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, on the success of this program. As part of its expansion program, the Company expects to open new stores and, in addition, expects to expand existing stores as opportunities arise.
The Company expects to open new stores in new and existing markets. In determining where to open new BBB stores, the Company evaluates a number of factors, including the availability of prime real estate and 6 demographic information (such as data relating to income and education levels, age and occupation). The Company believes that because BBB does not use central distribution centers, and since BBB relies on paid advertising to only a limited extent, it has the flexibility to enter a new market with only one or two BBB stores.
The Company will consider opening additional stores in that market after the stores have been proven successful. The Company currently plans to open new BBB, Harmon and CTS stores in fiscal 2004.
The Company has built its management structure with a view towards its expansion and believes that, as a result, the Company has the management depth necessary to support its anticipated expansion program. Each of BBBs area managers typically supervises up to three BBB stores and district managers typically supervise four to ten stores.
Store Operations Merchandising BBB maintains its own central buying group. The merchandise mix for each BBB store is initially selected by the central buying group, in consultation with store managers and other local store personnel. The central buying group is generally responsible for the procurement of merchandise, including: selecting the merchandise, ordering the initial inventory required upon the opening of each BBB store, ordering the first shipment of any new product line that may be subsequently added to a stores merchandise mix and ordering seasonal merchandise.
After a BBB store is opened, local store personnel are primarily responsible for monitoring inventory levels and reordering merchandise as required. In addition, local store personnel are encouraged to monitor local sales trends and market conditions and tailor the merchandise mix as appropriate to respond to changing trends and conditions. The Company believes that its policy of having the reordering function for BBB stores performed at the local store level, rather than centrally, and having local store personnel determine the appropriate quantity to reorder, encourages entrepreneurship at the store level. In addition, this better ensures that in-stock availability will be maintained in accordance with the specific requirements of each store. The factors taken into account in selecting the merchandise mix for a particular BBB store include store size and configuration and local market conditions such as climate and demographics.
The Company purchases its merchandise from more than 3,900 suppliers. In fiscal 2003, the Companys largest supplier accounted for approximately 5% of the Companys merchandise purchases and the Companys 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 23% of such purchases. The Company purchases substantially all of its merchandise in the United States, the majority from domestic manufacturers and the balance from importers. The Company purchases a small amount of its merchandise directly from overseas sources.
The Company has no long-term contracts for the purchase of merchandise. The Company believes that most merchandise, other than brand name goods, is available from a variety of sources and that most brand name goods can be replaced with comparable merchandise.
Warehousing Merchandise is primarily shipped directly to each BBB store from its vendors, making it unnecessary for BBB to maintain central distribution centers. As a result of the floor to ceiling displays typically used by BBB, a substantial amount of merchandise is displayed on the sales floor of each store at all times. Additional merchandise not displayed on the sales floor is stored in warehouse space within or near the store (with an estimated 10% to 15% of the BBB store space dedicated to warehouse and receiving space). In the case of a few stores, merchandise 7 is also stored at nearby supplemental storage space leased by the Company. At present, the warehouse space included in BBBs stores provides approximately 88% of BBBs warehouse space requirements and such nearby supplemental storage space provides the balance.
CTS and Harmon maintain central distribution centers of approximately 537,000 and 78,000 square feet, respectively. These distribution centers are responsible for shipping the majority of merchandise to their respective stores.
Management The Company encourages responsiveness and entrepreneurship at the store level by providing its managers with a relatively high degree of autonomy relating to operations and merchandising. This is reflected in the Companys policy of encouraging managers to tailor the merchandise mix of each store in response to local sales trends and market conditions.
On average, BBB stores are staffed with two assistant managers, one operations manager, and three to six department managers who all report to a store manager. The store manager, in turn, reports to an area or district manager. Area and district managers report to one of several regional managers or directly to one of five regional Vice Presidents of Stores, who in turn report to the Senior Vice President - Stores.
Training The Company places great emphasis on the training of store level management. All entry-level management personnel are generally required to work in various departments of the store to acquire an overall understanding of store operations. In addition, all BBB store associates receive formalized training, including sales techniques and product knowledge, through the Bed Bath & Beyond University program.
The Companys policy is to generally build its management organization from within. Each of the Companys area, district and regional managers was recruited from the ranks of the Companys store managers and each of the Companys store managers joined the Company in an entry-level position. The Company believes that its policy of promoting from within, as well as the opportunities for advancement generated by its ongoing expansion program, serve as incentives to persons to seek and retain employment with the Company, and result in low turnover among its managers.
Employees As of February 28, 2004, the Company employed approximately 29,000 persons, of whom approximately 15,000 were full-time employees and approximately 14,000 were part-time employees. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are excellent and that the labor turnover rate among its management employees is lower than that experienced within the industry.
Seasonality The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in August, November and December, and generally lower in February and March.
8 Inflation The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance; however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future.
Competition The market for domestics merchandise and home furnishings is fragmented and highly competitive. While the Company believes it is the preeminent marketer in its segment of the home goods industry, its BBB stores compete directly with a small number of store chains selling domestics merchandise and home furnishings. In addition, BBB stores compete with many different types of retail stores that sell many or most of the same products. Such competitors include: (i) better department stores, which often carry many of the same product lines as BBBstores but do not typically have the same depth or breadth of product selection, (ii)specialty stores (such as specialty linens or housewares retailers), which often have a depth of product selection but typically carry only a limited portion of the product lines carried by BBB stores, and (iii)discount and mass merchandise stores. In addition, BBB stores compete, to a more limited extent, with factory outlet stores that typically offer limited quantities or limited lines of better quality merchandise at discount prices.
The Company believes that it is the largest operator of stores selling predominantly better quality domestics merchandise and home furnishings typically found in better department stores, and that it is well positioned to compete successfully in its markets as measured by several factors, including pricing, breadth and quality of product selection, in-stock availability of merchandise, effective merchandise presentation, customer service and store locations.
The visibility of the Company has encouraged competitors to imitate BBB stores format and methods. Other retail chains continue to introduce new store concepts that include many of the product lines carried by BBB stores. There can be no assurance that the operation of store competitors, including those companies operating stores similar to those of BBB, will not have a material effect on the Company.
Tradenames and Service Marks The Company uses the nationally recognized Bed Bath & Beyond name and logo and the Beyond any store of its kind tag line as service marks in connection with retail services. The Company has registered these marks and others, including names and logos of Harmon and CTS, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company also has registered or has applications pending with the trademark registries of several foreign countries. Management believes that its name recognition and service marks are important elements of the Companys merchandising strategy.
Available Information The Company makes available as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the SEC, free of charge, through its website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, the Companys annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, electronically filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

14 ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW In fiscal 2003, the Companys consolidated net sales increased by 22.2% and net earnings increased by 32.2%. Contributing to this increase was the expansion of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBB) store space by 12.2%, from 17,255,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2002 to 19,353,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2003. The 2,098,000 square feet increase was primarily the result of opening 85 new BBB stores and relocating two existing stores. In fiscal 2002, the Company expanded BBB store space by 17.2%, or 2,531,000 square feet, from 14,724,000 square feet at fiscal year end 2001. The 2,531,000 square feet increase was the result of opening 95 new stores offset by the closing of one small store.
Also contributing to these increases in fiscal 2003 and 2002 were two acquisitions made by the Company. In June 2003, the Company acquired Christmas Tree Shops, Inc. (CTS) for approximately $194.4 million, net of cash acquired, plus the costs of the acquisition, which includes $175.5 million of cash and $18.9 million in deferred payments payable in cash over the next three years. CTS is a retailer of giftware and household items selling a broad assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings at low prices in many categories including home dcor, giftware, housewares, food, paper goods, and seasonal products. CTS results of operations are included in the Companys consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition. In March 2002, the Company acquired Harmon Stores, Inc. (Harmon), a health and beauty care retailer, for approximately $24.1 million, net of cash acquired. Harmons results of operations are included in the Companys consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition. On a combined basis, CTS and Harmon store space totaled 1,119,000 square feet at February 28, 2004.
Comparable store sales for fiscal 2003 increased by approximately 6.3% as compared with an increase of approximately 7.9% and 7.1% in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. The fiscal 2003 increase in comparable store sales reflected a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings, a strong focus on customer service and the continued success of the Companys advertising program.
The Company plans to continue to expand its operations and invest in its infrastructure to reach its long-term objectives.
15 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated (i)selected statement of earnings data of the Company expressed as a percentage of net sales and (ii)the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of earnings data: Fiscal   Year Ended Percentage of Net Sales Percentage   Change from Prior Year February   28, 2004 March 1, 2003 March 2, 2002 February   28, 2004 March 1, 2003 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 22.2 % 25.2 % Cost of sales 58.1 58.6 58.8 21.2 24.8 Gross profit 41.9 41.4 41.2 23.6 25.8 Selling, general and administrative   expenses 27.6 28.3 29.4 19.1 20.5 Operating profit 14.3 13.1 11.8 33.2 38.7 Earnings before provision for income taxes 14.5 13.4 12.2 32.2 37.6 Net earnings 8.9 8.2 7.5 32.2 37.6 Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2003 increased $812.8 million to $4.478 billion, representing an increase of 22.2% over the $3.665 billion of net sales in fiscal 2002, which increased $737.2 million or 25.2% over net sales of $2.928 billion in fiscal 2001. Approximately 41% of the increase in fiscal 2003 was attributable to BBB new store sales and 34% of the increase was attributable to the net sales of CTS, which was acquired in June 2003. The increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2003 of 6.3% was due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the continued consumer acceptance of the Companys merchandise offerings, a strong focus on customer service and the continued success of the Companys advertising program. For fiscal 2002, new store sales contributed approximately 68% to the increase in net sales and the balance to an increase in comparable store sales and the acquisition of Harmon in March 2002.
Sales of domestics merchandise accounted for approximately 51%, 55% and 54% of net sales in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, of which the Company estimates that bed linens accounted for approximately 16%, 19% and 19% of net sales in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The remaining net sales in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 of 49%, 45% and 46%, respectively, represented sales of home furnishings. The change in the product mix between fiscal 2003 and 2002 is primarily the result of the acquisition of CTS. No other individual product category accounted for 10% or more of net sales during fiscal 2003, 2002 or 2001.
Gross Profit Gross profit in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $1.877 billion or 41.9% of net sales, $1.519 billion or 41.4% of net sales and $1.208 billion or 41.2% of net sales, respectively. The increase in gross profit between fiscal 2003 and 2002 as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to improvements in both the markup and in markdowns taken. The slight increase in gross profit between fiscal 2002 and 2001 was the result of 16 improvements in markup on the mix of product purchased in fiscal 2002 offset by the relative increase in markdowns recorded in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001.
Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $1.237 billion or 27.6% of net sales in fiscal 2003 compared to $1.038 billion or 28.3% of net sales in fiscal 2002. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales primarily reflects a decrease in occupancy costs, other store expenses and costs associated with new store openings, partially offset by an increase in litigation expense and net advertising costs. Store opening and expansion costs are charged to earnings as incurred.
SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased to 28.3% in fiscal 2002 from 29.4% in fiscal 2001 primarily as a result of a decrease in occupancy costs and costs associated with new store openings, partially offset by an increase in payroll and payroll related items. SG&A in fiscal 2002 was $1.038 billion as compared to $861.5 million in fiscal 2001.
Interest income Interest income decreased to $10.2 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $11.3 million in fiscal 2002 due to a decrease in the average investment interest rate partially offset by an increase in cash invested. However, interest income increased in fiscal 2002 from $11.0 million in fiscal 2001 due to the increase in invested cash partially offset by a decrease in the average investment rate.
Income taxes The effective tax rate was 38.5% for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 due to the weighted average effective tax rate remaining consistent in the states and territory in which the Company currently conducts business.
EXPANSION PROGRAM The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the opening of new stores in both new and existing markets and the expansion or relocation of existing stores. In the twelve year period from the beginning of fiscal 1992 to the end of fiscal 2003, the chain has grown from 34 to 575 BBB stores. Total BBB stores square footage grew from 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal 1992 to 19,353,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2003. There were 30 Harmon stores with 204,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2003. There were 24 CTS stores with 915,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2003.
The Company intends to continue its expansion program and currently plans to open new BBB, Harmon and CTS stores in fiscal 2004 (see details under Liquidity and Capital Resources below). The Company believes that a predominant portion of any increase in its net sales in fiscal 2004 will continue to be attributable to new store net sales. Accordingly, the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, upon the Companys ability to execute its expansion program successfully, of which there can be no assurance.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company has been able to finance its operations, including its expansion program, through internally generated funds. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2003 was $548.4 million, compared with $419.3 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income, an increase in the tax benefit received from the exercise of stock options and improved management of working capital, partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable due to an increase in tax payments.
17 Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2003 was $292.5 million compared with $357.4 million in fiscal 2002. The change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in the redemption of investment securities partially offset by the acquisition of CTS.
The aggregate all cash purchase price of CTS, including the cost of the acquisition, was approximately $194.4 million, net of cash acquired, which includes $175.5 million of cash and $18.9 million in deferred payments payable in cash over the next three years. The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations.
Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2003 was $53.4 million, compared with $24.2 million in fiscal 2002. The change in net cash provided by financing activities was attributable to an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by the prepayment of CTS debt in conjunction with the acquisition.
At February 28, 2004, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $75 million and $50 million, which expire in September 2004 and November 2004, respectively. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. It is the Companys intent to maintain an uncommitted line of credit for these purposes. During fiscal 2003, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of February 28, 2004, there was approximately $15.0 million in outstanding letters of credit. In addition, at February 28, 2004, the Company maintained unsecured standby letters of credit of $40 million, primarily for certain insurance programs, of which approximately $35.8 million was outstanding. The Company believes that during fiscal 2004, internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund its operations, including its expansion program.
The Company has contractual obligations consisting mainly of operating leases for store, office and other facilities and equipment and purchase obligations which are payable as of February 28, 2004 as follows: (in   thousands) Total Less than   1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years Operating Lease Obligations $ 2,727,162 $ 273,934 $ 842,674 $ 514,046 $ 1,096,508 Purchase Obligations 643,994 643,994    Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,371,156 $ 917,928 $ 842,674 $ 514,046 $ 1,096,508 As of February 28, 2004, the Company has leased sites for 57 new stores planned for opening in fiscal 2004 or 2005, which are included in the table above. Approximate aggregate costs for the 57 leased stores are estimated at $79.9 million for merchandise inventories, $43.1 million for furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements and $11.8 million for store opening expenses (which will be expensed as incurred).
Purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise and capital expenditures. Typically, these purchase orders, which are not included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of February 28, 2004, allow the Company to cancel the orders without recourse.
SEASONALITY The Company exhibits less seasonality than many other retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in August, November and December and generally lower in February and March.
INFLATION The Company does not believe that its operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future.
18 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as the provision for sales returns, inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, vendor allowances and accruals for self insurance, litigation and store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Sales Returns : Sales returns, which are reserved for based on historical experience, are provided for in the period that the related sales are recorded.
Inventory Valuation : Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. In addition, the Company estimates a reserve for expected shrinkage throughout the year, based on historical shrinkage. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year-end based on the results of the Companys physical inventory count. At any one time, inventories include items that have been marked down to the Companys best estimate of their fair market value. Actual markdowns required could differ from this estimate.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss would be recognized during that period. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the present value of the estimated net cash flows. The Company does not believe that any material impairment currently exists related to its long-lived assets.
Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets: The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually and otherwise when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company does not believe that any material impairment currently exists related to its goodwill and indefinitely lived intangible assets.
Vendor Allowances : The Company receives various types of allowances from our merchandise vendors, which are based on negotiated terms. These allowances are recorded when earned as a reduction of cost of sales or as a reduction of other costs in accordance with the provisions of the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-16 Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor.
Self Insurance : The Company uses self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by our employees). Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.
Litigation : The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates as appropriate.
19 Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs : Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs are charged to earnings as incurred. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which was effective for any exit or disposal activity initiated after December 31, 2002, costs related to store relocations and closings were provided for in the period in which management approved the relocation or closing of a store. Actual costs related to store relocations and closings could differ from these estimates.
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10-K, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Shareholder Letter, contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements as a result of many factors that may be outside the Companys control. Such factors include, without limitation: general economic conditions, changes in the retailing environment and consumer spending habits, demographics and other macroeconomic factors that may impact the level of spending for the types of merchandise sold by the Company; unusual weather patterns; competition from existing and potential competitors; competition from other channels of distribution; pricing pressures; the ability to find suitable locations at reasonable occupancy costs to support the Companys expansion program; and the cost of labor, merchandise and other costs and expenses.
ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment securities. The Company is adverse to loss of principal and seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting market risk.
The Companys investment securities consist of fixed rate instruments. The Companys investments include cash and cash equivalents of $825.0 million, short term investment securities of $41.6 million and long term investment securities of $210.8 million at weighted average interest rates as of February 28, 2004 of 1.02%, 2.52% and 2.10%, respectively.

23 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and Subsidiaries 1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED MATTERS A.
Nature of Operations Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the Company) operates specialty retail stores nationwide, primarily of a big box format and selling predominantly better quality domestics merchandise and home furnishings. As the Company operates in the retail industry, its results of operations are affected by general economic conditions and consumer spending habits.
B.
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
C.
Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest February 28. Accordingly, fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 represented 52 weeks and ended on February 28, 2004, March 1, 2003, and March 2, 2002, respectively.
D.
Segments The Company accounts for its operations as one operating segment.
E.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as the provision for sales returns, inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets, vendor allowances and accruals for self insurance, litigation and store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
F.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements During fiscal 2003, the Company adopted the following pronouncements:  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. The standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
24  SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. Among other items, this Standard updates and clarifies existing accounting pronouncements related to reporting gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt and certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale-leaseback transactions. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No.45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN No.45 elaborates on the disclosures for interim and annual reports regarding obligations under certain guarantees issued by a guarantor. Under FIN No.45, the guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee at the inception of a guarantee. The recognition and measurement provisions of FIN No.45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002. The disclosure requirements for FIN No.45 are effective for interim and annual financial statements issued after December15, 2002. The adoption of FIN No.45 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
During January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity. The provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after January 31, 2003. For those arrangements entered into prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 were required to be adopted at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. However, in December 2003, the FASB published a revision to FIN 46 to clarify some of the provisions of FIN 46, and to exempt certain entities from its requirements. Under the new guidance, there are new effective dates for companies that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special-purpose entities. The rules are effective in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. The adoption did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
G.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, accounts payable and certain other liabilities. The Companys investment securities consist of held-to-maturity debt securities which are stated at amortized cost. The book value of all financial instruments is representative of their fair values with the exception of investment securities (see Note 5  Investment Securities).
H.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
I.
Inventory Valuation Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, generally using the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. In addition, the Company estimates a reserve for expected shrinkage throughout the year, based on historical shrinkage. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year-end based on the results of the Companys physical inventory count. At any one time, inventories include items that have been marked down to the Companys best estimate of their fair market value. Actual markdowns required could differ from this estimate.
25 J.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (forty years for buildings; five to fifteen years for furniture, fixtures and equipment; and three to five years for computer equipment and software). Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful life or the life of the lease.
The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to earnings as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs amounted to $44.5 million, $34.7 million and $34.3 million for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
K.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss would be recognized during that period. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the present value of the estimated net cash flows. The Company does not believe that any material impairment currently exists related to its long-lived assets.
L.
Investment Securities Investment securities consist of U.S. Government Agency debt securities and municipal debt securities. Because the Company has the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity, it classifies its securities as held-to-maturity. These investment securities are recorded at amortized cost. Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted over the life of the related held-to-maturity securities as adjustments to interest income using the effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
M.
Goodwill and Other Indefinitely Lived Intangible Assets The Company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually and otherwise when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. The Company does not believe that any material impairment currently exists related to its goodwill and indefinitely lived intangible assets.
Included within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of February 28, 2004 is $19.9 million for the tradename of Christmas Tree Shops, Inc. (CTS) (see Note 2 - Acquisitions) which is not subject to amortization.
N.
Gift Cards, Gift Certificates and Merchandise Credits Gift cards, gift certificates and merchandise credits which have not been redeemed are recorded as a liability within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and amounted to an aggregate total of $63.2 million and $44.2 million as of February 28, 2004 and March 1, 2003, respectively.
26 O.
Self Insurance The Company uses self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by our employees). Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.
P.
Deferred Rent The Company accounts for scheduled rent increases contained in its leases on a straight-line basis over the noncancelable lease term. Deferred rent amounted to $32.7 million and $29.1 million as of February 28, 2004 and March 1, 2003, respectively.
Q.
Litigation The Company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel, where appropriate. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates as appropriate.
R.
Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at our retail stores or when shipped for products purchased from our websites. The value of point of sale coupons and point of sale rebates that result in a reduction of the price paid by the customer are recorded as a reduction of sales. Shipping and handling fees that are billed to a customer in a sale transaction are recorded in sales. Revenues from gift cards, gift certificates and merchandise credits are recognized when redeemed. Sales returns, which are reserved for based on historical experience, are provided for in the period that the related sales are recorded.
S.
Vendor Allowances The Company receives various types of allowances from our merchandise vendors, which are based on negotiated terms. These allowances are recorded when earned as a reduction of cost of sales or as a reduction of other costs in accordance with the provisions of the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-16 Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor.
T.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise; certain buying, occupancy, warehouse and indirect costs; shipping and handling costs and free merchandise incentives.
U.
Store Opening, Expansion, Relocation and Closing Costs Store opening, expansion, relocation and closing costs are charged to earnings as incurred. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which was effective for any exit or disposal activity initiated after December 31, 2002, costs related to store relocations and closings were provided for in the period in which management approved the relocation or closing of a store.
V.
Advertising Costs Expenses associated with store advertising are charged to earnings as incurred. Net advertising costs amounted to $93.7 million, $58.8 million and $46.1 million for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
27 W. Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return. Separate income tax returns are filed with each state and territory in which the Company conducts business.
The Company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Company's tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
X. Earnings per Share The Company presents earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis. Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding including the dilutive effect of stock options.
Options for which the exercise price was greater than the average market price of common shares as of the fiscal years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. These consisted of options totaling 543,750, 158,925 and 22,275 shares, respectively.
Y. Stock-Based Compensation As permitted under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and subsequently amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, the Company has elected not to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for its stock-based compensation plans, but continues to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company has complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized in connection with the Companys stock option plans. Set forth below are the Companys net earnings and net earnings per share as reported, and as if compensation cost had been recognized (pro forma) in accordance with the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123: 28 FISCAL YEAR (in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 NET EARNINGS: As reported $ 399,470 $ 302,179 $ 219,599 Deduct: Total stock-based   employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method, net   of related tax effects (29,372 ) (25,443 ) (19,590 ) Pro forma $ 370,098 $ 276,736 $ 200,009 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE: Basic: As reported $ 1.35 $ 1.03 $ 0.76 Pro forma $ 1.25 $ 0.94 $ 0.69 Diluted: As reported $ 1.31 $ 1.00 $ 0.74 Pro forma $ 1.23 $ 0.92 $ 0.67 The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: FISCAL YEAR 2003 2002 2001 Dividend yield    Expected volatility 45.00 % 45.00 % 45.00 % Risk free interest rates 2.96 % 4.72 % 4.80 % Expected lives (years) 5.9 7.0 7.0 Weighted average fair   value of options granted during the year $ 16.29 $ 17.15 $ 12.77 On March 31, 2004, the FASB issued an exposure draft that would require the fair value of stockbased compensation to be recognized as a cost in the financial statements. The exposure draft provides for a comment period, which ends June 30, 2004. The proposed statement would be effective for awards that are granted, modified, or settled in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. As the exposure draft has not been finalized, the Company can not yet determine the impact of any requirement to recognize stock-based compensation as a cost in the consolidated financial statements.
2.
ACQUISITIONS On June 19, 2003, the Company acquired CTS. CTS is a retailer of giftware and household items selling a broad assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings at low prices in many categories including home dcor, giftware, housewares, food, paper goods, and seasonal products. The results of CTS operations have been 29 included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. At the date of acquisition, CTS, headquartered in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts, operated 23 stores in 6 states.
The aggregate all cash purchase price, including the costs of the acquisition, was approximately $194.4 million, net of cash acquired, which included $175.5 million of cash and $18.9 million in deferred payments payable in cash over the next three years.
The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition including a debt prepayment penalty. The Company is in the process of finalizing the valuations of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed; thus the allocation of the purchase price is subject to refinement.
(in thousands) June 19, 2003 Current assets $ 73,302 Property   and equipment and other non-current assets 72,680 Intangible asset 19,898 Goodwill 131,713 Total assets acquired 297,593 Accounts payable and other   liabilities (82,027 ) Bank debt (21,215 ) Total liabilities assumed (103,242 ) Net assets acquired $ 194,351 The intangible asset acquired represents the CTS tradename and is not subject to amortization. The goodwill and intangible asset are expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The pro forma financial information of the Company presented below is unaudited and is based on the Companys historical results, adjusted for the impact of certain acquisition related items, such as: the reduction of net interest income due to the purchase price paid and the prepayment of CTS debt, the net reduction of certain selling, general and administrative expenses directly attributable to the transaction, and the related pro forma income tax effects, in each case as if they occurred as of the beginning of each respective period.
For the   Year Ended (in   thousands, except per share data) February   28, 2004 (Pro Forma) March 1, 2003 (Pro Forma) Net sales $ 4,582,309 $ 4,037,956 Net earnings 402,479 318,139 Net earnings per share: Basic 1.36 1.09 Diluted 1.32 1.06 30 The unaudited pro forma results of the Company have been prepared for comparative purposes only and in managements opinion, do not purport to be indicative of the Companys results of operations that would have occurred had the CTS acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the respective periods. Pro forma results are not intended to be a projection of future results.
On March 5, 2002, the Company acquired Harmon Stores, Inc. (Harmon), a health and beauty care retailer, which did not have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition in fiscal 2003 or 2002.
3.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment consist of the following: (in thousands) February   28, 2004 March 1, 2003 Land and buildings $ 28,189 $ 6,875 Furniture, fixtures and   equipment 387,517 321,507 Leasehold improvements 333,502 268,493 Computer equipment and   software 146,999 122,896 896,207 719,771 Less: Accumulated   depreciation and amortization (380,043 ) (295,864 ) $ 516,164 $ 423,907 4.
LINES OF CREDIT At February 28, 2004, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines of credit of $75 million and $50 million, which expire in September 2004 and November 2004, respectively. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently used for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. It is the Companys intent to maintain an uncommitted line of credit for these purposes. During fiscal 2003, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines of credit. As of February 28, 2004, there was approximately $15.0 million in outstanding letters of credit. In addition, at February 28, 2004, the Company maintained unsecured standby letters of credit of $40 million, primarily for certain insurance programs, of which approximately $35.8 million was outstanding.
The Company maintained an uncommitted line of credit of $75 million at March 1, 2003. This uncommitted line of credit was utilized for letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. During fiscal 2002, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted line of credit. At March 1, 2003, there was approximately $8.5 million of outstanding letters of credit and $16.2 million of standby letters of credit.
31 5.
INVESTMENT SECURITIES The Companys investment securities consist of held-to-maturity U.S. Government Agency debt securities and municipal debt securities, which are stated at amortized cost. The Company intends to hold the securities to maturity and has classified the investments as such. The following table summarizes the Companys investment securities: February   28, 2004 March 1, 2003 (in thousands) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Debt securities: Short term $ 41.6 $ 41.6 $ 100.9 $ 101.8 Long term 210.8 211.4 148.0 148.4 Total investment securities $ 252.4 $ 253.0 $ 248.9 $ 250.2 The securities with maturity dates within one year are classified as short term investment securities and those with maturity dates beyond one year are classified as long term investment securities. The maturity dates of long term investment securities extend to February 2006 based on the current contractual maturities. Actual maturities could differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call certain obligations.
The excess of the fair value over the amortized cost is substantially the result of unrecognized gains in fiscal 2003 and 2002. There were no material unrealized losses in fiscal 2003 and 2002.
6.

TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES WITH RELATED PARTIES A.
In fiscal 2002, the Company had an interest in certain life insurance policies on the lives of its Co-Chairmen and their spouses. The beneficiaries of these policies were related to the aforementioned individuals. The Companys interest in these policies was equivalent to the net premiums paid by the Company. At March 1, 2003, other assets (noncurrent) included $5.4 million, representing the Companys interest in the life insurance policies. Since the Company is no longer permitted to pay policy premiums due to restrictions in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the agreements relating to the Companys interest in the life insurance policies on the lives of its Co-Chairmen and their spouses were terminated in fiscal 2003. Upon termination, the Co-Chairmen paid to the Company $5.4 million, representing the total amount of premiums paid by the Company under the agreements and the Company was released from its contractual obligation to make substantial future premium payments. In order to confer a benefit to its Co-Chairmen in substitution for the aforementioned terminated agreements, the Company has agreed to pay, to the Co-Chairmen at a future date, an aggregate amount of $4.2 million, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.

37 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 28, 2004 and March 1, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 28, 2004. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bed Bath& Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 28, 2004 and March 1, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 28, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
