Business General .         CenturyTel, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is an integrated         communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of communications         services, including local and long distance voice, Internet access and broadband         services. We strive to maintain our customer relationships by, among other         things, bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete         offering of integrated communications services. We conduct all of our operations         in 25 states located within the continental United States.
At         December 31, 2006, our incumbent local exchange telephone subsidiaries operated         approximately 2.1 million telephone access lines, primarily in rural areas         and         small to mid-size cities in 21 states, with over 70% of these lines located         in         Missouri, Wisconsin, Alabama, Arkansas and Washington. According to published         sources, we are the seventh largest local exchange telephone company in the         United States based on the number of access lines served.
We         also         provide fiber transport, competitive local exchange carrier, security         monitoring, and other communications and business information services in         certain local and regional markets.
Since         2005, we have expanded our product offerings to include co-branded satellite         television services, wireless communications services under reselling         arrangements, Internet voice communication services, and wireless broadband         services. For additional information, see Operations - Recent Product         Developments below.
For         information on the amount of revenue derived by our various lines of services,         see Operations - Services below and Item 7 of this annual report.
Recent         acquisitions .         In June         2005, we acquired fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC Telecom         Holdings, Inc. (KMC) for approximately $75.5 million, which allows us to offer         broadband and competitive local exchange services to customers in these markets.
In         June         2003, we purchased for $39.4 million the assets of Digital Teleport, Inc.,         a         regional communications company providing wholesale data transport services         to         other communications carriers over its fiber optic network located in Missouri,         Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kansas. In addition, in December 2003, we acquired         additional fiber transport assets in Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois from         Level         3 Communications, Inc. for approximately $15.8 million cash. For additional         information, see Operations - Services - Fiber Transport and CLEC.
4 Table             of Contents On         August         31, 2002, we purchased assets utilized in serving approximately 350,000         telephone access lines in the state of Missouri from Verizon Communications,         Inc. (Verizon) for approximately $1.179 billion cash. On July 1, 2002, we         purchased assets utilized in serving approximately 300,000 telephone access         lines in the state of Alabama from Verizon for approximately $1.022 billion         cash.
The         assets purchased in these transactions included (i) the franchises and equipment         necessary to conduct local exchange operations in predominantly rural markets         throughout Alabama and Missouri and (ii) Verizon's assets used to provide         high-         speed data services within the purchased exchanges. The acquired assets did         not         include Verizon's cellular, personal communications services (PCS), long         distance, dial-up Internet, or directory publishing operations in these         areas.
On         February 28, 2002, we purchased from KMC its fiber network and customer base         operations in Monroe and Shreveport, Louisiana, which allowed us to offer         broadband and competitive local exchange services to customers in these markets.
We         also         acquired approximately 660,000 and 490,000 telephone access lines in         transactions completed in 1997 and 2000, respectively, the former of which         substantially expanded our operations in the Western United States.
We         continually evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional communications         assets in exchange for cash, securities or both, and at any given time may         be         engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions.         We         generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have         entered         into a preliminary or definitive agreement. Although our primary focus will         continue to be on acquiring interests that are proximate to our properties         or         that serve a customer base large enough for us to operate efficiently, we         may         also acquire other communications interests and these acquisitions could         have a         material impact upon us.
Pending         Acquisition.
On         December 17, 2006, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Madison         River         Communications Corp. (MRCC) and its owner, Madison River Telephone Company,         LLC. Under this agreement, we agreed to purchase all of the capital stock         of         MRCC in exchange for $830 million less MRCCs net indebtedness on the         transactions closing date (which was approximately $494 million at September         30, 2006), subject to certain closing adjustments.
MRCC         operates more than 170,000 predominantly rural access lines in four states         with         more than 30% high-speed Internet penetration. MRCCs network is 99%         broadband-enabled and includes a 2,400 route mile fiber network, substantially         all of which is leased under indefeasible rights of use agreements. The         acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2007, subject to         the         satisfaction of certain closing conditions including necessary approvals         from         federal and state regulators.
5 Table               of Contents Recent         Dispositions .         On         August 1, 2002, we sold substantially all of our wireless operations principally         to an affiliate of ALLTEL Corporation (Alltel) for an aggregate of         approximately $1.59 billion in cash. In connection with this transaction,         we         divested our (i) interest in our majority-owned and operated cellular systems,         which at June 30, 2002 served approximately 783,000 customers and had access         to         approximately 7.8 million pops (the estimated population of licensed cellular         telephone markets multiplied by our proportionate equity interest in the         licensed operators thereof), (ii) minority cellular equity interests         representing approximately 1.8 million pops at June 30, 2002, and (iii) licenses         to provide PCS covering 1.3 million pops in Wisconsin and Iowa.
Where         to find additional information.
We         make         available our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on         Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K on our website ( www.centurytel.com )         as soon         as reasonably practicable after we complete such filings with the         SEC.
We         also         make available on our website our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Corporate         Compliance Program and the charters of our audit, compensation, risk evaluation,         and nominating and corporate governance committees. We will furnish printed         copies of these materials free of charge upon the request of any         shareholder.
In         connection with filing this annual report, our chief executive officer and         chief         financial officer made the certifications regarding our financial disclosures         required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the Acts related         regulations. In addition, during 2006 our chief executive officer certified         to         the New York Stock Exchange that he was unaware of any violation by us of         the         New York Stock Exchanges corporate governance listing standards.
Industry         information .         Unless         otherwise indicated, information contained in this annual report and other         documents filed by us under the federal securities laws concerning our views         and         expectations regarding the telecommunications industry are based on estimates         made by us using data from industry sources, and on assumptions made by us         based         on our managements knowledge and experience in the markets in which we operate         and the telecommunications industry generally. We believe these estimates         and         assumptions are accurate as of the date made. However, this information may         prove to be inaccurate because it cannot always be verified with certainty.         You         should be aware that we have not independently verified data from industry         or         other third-party sources and cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness.         Our         estimates and assumptions involve risks and uncertainties and are subject         to         change based on various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A of         this         annual report.
Other .         As of         December 31, 2006, we had approximately 6,400 employees, of which approximately         1,600 were members of 12 different bargaining units represented by the         International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Communications Workers         of America. We believe that relations with our employees continue to be         generally good. On March 1, 2006 and August 30, 2006, we announced reductions         of         our workforce which aggregated approximately 400 jobs, or 6% of our workforce,         primarily due to increased competitive pressures and the loss of access lines         over the last several years.
6 Table             of Contents We         were         incorporated under Louisiana law in 1968 to serve as a holding company for         several telephone companies acquired over the previous 15 to 20 years. Our         principal executive offices are located at 100 CenturyTel Drive, Monroe,         Louisiana 71203 and our telephone number is (318) 388-9000.
OPERATIONS According         to published sources, we are the seventh largest local exchange telephone         company in the United States, based on the approximately 2.1 million access         lines we served at December 31, 2006. An access line is a telephone line that         connects a home or business to the public switched telephone network. All         of our         access lines are digitally switched. Through our operating telephone         subsidiaries, we provide local exchange services to predominantly rural areas         and small to mid-sized cities in 21 states. Our local exchange companies         serve         an average of approximately 12 access lines per square mile versus a nationwide         average of approximately 50 access lines per square mile.
7 Table             of Contents The         following table lists additional information regarding our access lines as         of         December 31, 2006 and 2005.

8 Table             of Contents As         indicated in the following table, we have generally experienced growth in         our         operating revenues over the past five years, a substantial portion of which         was         attributable to the third quarter 2002 acquisition of telephone properties         from         Verizon and the internal growth of our Internet access business.

To mitigate         these declines, we hope to, among other things, (i) promote long-term         relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services,         (ii)         provide new services, such as video and wireless, and other additional services         that may become available in the future due to advances in technology, spectrum         sales or improvements in our infrastructure, (iii) provide our premium services         to a higher percentage of our customers, (iv) pursue acquisitions of additional         communications properties if available at attractive prices, (v) increase         usage         of our networks, and (vi) market our products to new customers. See Services and Regulation and Competition.
S ervices We         derive         revenue from providing (i) local exchange and long distance voice telephone         services, (ii) network access services, (iii) data services, which includes         both         high-speed and dial-up Internet services, as well as special access and private         line services, (iv) fiber transport, competitive local exchange and security         monitoring services and (v) other related services. The following table reflects         the percentage of operating revenues derived from these respective         services: 2006 2005 2004 Voice 35.2 % 36.0 37.5 Network                   access 35.9 38.7 40.1 Data 14.3 12.9 11.5 Fiber                   transport and CLEC 6.1 4.7 3.1 Other 8.5 7.7 7.8 100.0 % 100.0 100.0 9 Table               of Contents Voice.
We         derive our local service revenues by providing local exchange telephone services         in our service areas, including basic dial-tone service through our regular         switched network, generally for a fixed monthly charge. Access lines declined         4.8% in 2006 (exclusive of certain adjustments mentioned earlier), 4.3% in         2005         and 2.6% in 2004. We believe these declines in the number of access lines         were         primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services         by         other competitive services. We expect access lines to decline between 4.5%         and         6.0% for 2007.
In         exchange for additional charges, we offer enhanced voice services (such as         call         forwarding, conference calling, caller identification, selective call ringing         and call waiting). In 2006, we continued to expand the availability of enhanced         services offered in certain service areas.
We         derive         our long distance revenues by providing retail long distance services based         on         either usage or pursuant to flat-rate calling plans. At December 31, 2006,         we         provided long distance services to nearly 1.2 million lines. We continue         to add         new customers, although the rate of our customer growth has slowed in recent         periods, principally due to competitive factors. We anticipate that most         of our         long distance service revenues will be provided as part of an integrated         bundle         with our other service offerings, including our local exchange telephone         service         offering.
Network         access.
We         derive our network access revenues primarily from (i) providing services         to         various carriers and customers in connection with the use of our facilities         to         originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice transmissions         and         (ii) receiving universal support funds which allows us to recover a portion         of         our costs under federal and state cost recovery mechanisms (see Regulation and         Competition Relating to Incumbent Local Exchange Operations below). Our         revenues for switched access services depend primarily on the level of call         volume.
Certain         of our interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges         prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC); the remainder of         such revenues are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other local         exchange carriers (LECs) administered by the National Exchange Carrier         Association (NECA), a quasi-governmental non-profit organization formed by the         FCC in 1983 for such purposes.
Certain         of our intrastate network access revenues are derived through access charges         that we bill to intrastate long distance carriers and other LEC customers.         Such         intrastate network access charges are based on tariffed access charges, which         are subject to state regulatory commission approval. Additionally, certain         of         our intrastate network access revenues, along with intrastate and intra-LATA         (Local Access and Transport Areas) long distance revenues, are derived through         revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs.
10 Table             of Contents The         Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act) allows local exchange carriers         to file access tariffs on a streamlined basis and, if certain criteria are         met,         deems those tariffs lawful. Tariffs that have been deemed lawful in effect         nullify an interexchange carriers ability to seek refunds should the earnings         from the tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized rate         of         return prescribed by the FCC. Certain of our telephone subsidiaries file         interstate tariffs with the FCC using this streamlined filing approach. Since         July 2004, we have recognized billings from our tariffs as revenue since         we         believe such tariffs are deemed lawful. For those billings from tariffs prior         to July 2004, we initially recorded as a liability our earnings in excess         of the         authorized rate of return, and may thereafter recognize as revenue some or         all         of these amounts at the end of the settlement period or as our legal entitlement         thereto becomes certain. As of December 31, 2006, the amount of our earnings         in         excess of the authorized rate of return reflected as a liability on the balance         sheet for the 2003/2004 monitoring period aggregated approximately $43 million.         The settlement period related to the 2003/2004 monitoring period lapses on         September 30, 2007.
Data.
We         derive our         data         revenues primarily from monthly recurring charges for providing Internet         access         services (both high-speed and dial-up services) and data transmission services         over special circuits and private lines. We began offering traditional dial-up         Internet access services to our telephone customers in 1995. In late 1999,         we         began offering high-speed Internet access services, a premium-priced broadband         data service. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 79% of our access lines         were broadband-enabled. At December 31, 2006, we provided high-speed Internet         access services to over 369,000 customers and dial-up services to over 90,000         customers. During 2006, we added over 120,000 high-speed Internet         customers.
Fiber         transport and CLEC .         Our         fiber transport and CLEC revenues include revenues from our fiber transport,         competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) and security monitoring         businesses.
In         late         2000, we began offering competitive local exchange telephone services as         part of         a bundled service offering to small to medium-sized businesses in Monroe         and         Shreveport, Louisiana. On February 28, 2002, we purchased the fiber network         and         customer base of KMCs operations in Monroe and Shreveport, Louisiana and in         June 2005, we purchased the fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from         KMC         which allowed us to offer broadband and competitive local exchange services         to         customers in these markets. As of December 31, 2006, our competitive local         exchange markets provided service over 1,200 miles of fiber.
Under         the         name LightCore, we sell fiber capacity to other carriers and businesses over a         network that encompassed, at December 31, 2006, over 9,500 miles of fiber         in the         central United States. We began our fiber transport business during the second         quarter of 2001, when we began selling capacity over a 700-mile fiber optic         ring         that we constructed in southern and central Michigan. In June 2003, we acquired         the assets of Digital Teleport, Inc., a regional communications company         providing wholesale data transport services to other communications carriers         over its fiber optic network located in Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma and         Kansas.         We have used the network to sell services to new and existing customers and         to         reduce our reliance on third party transport providers. In addition, in December         2003, we acquired additional fiber transport assets in Arkansas, Missouri         and         Illinois from Level 3 Communications, Inc. to provide services similar to         those         described above.
11 Table             of Contents We offer         24-hour burglary and fire monitoring services to over 9,700 customers in         select         markets in Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas and Ohio.
Other.
We         derive our other revenues principally by (i) leasing, selling, installing and         maintaining customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring, (ii)         providing billing and collection services to third parties, (iii) participating         in the publication of local telephone directories, which allows us to share         in         revenues generated by the sale of yellow page and related advertising to         businesses, and (iv) offering our new services described below under the         heading -Recent Product Developments. We also provide printing, database management         and direct mail services and cable television services.
From         time         to time, we also make investments in other domestic or foreign communications         companies.
For         further information on regulatory, technological and competitive changes         that         could impact our revenues, see Regulation and Competition under this Item 1         below and Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements under Item 1A below. For more         information on the financial contributions of our various services, see Item         7         of this annual report.
Recent         Product Developments During         2005, we began offering, under a three-year agreement with EchoStar, co-branded         satellite television service to virtually all households in our local exchange         service areas, except for LaCrosse, Wisconsin, where we initiated our switched         digital television service to a portion of this market. In early 2007, we         initiated a second switched digital video trial in Columbia,         Missouri.
In         mid-2005, we began reselling wireless communication services under an agreement         with a nationwide wireless carrier. By December 31, 2006, we offered wireless         service through this arrangement to markets serving approximately 30% of         our         residential access lines.
In         December 2006, we completed construction of a wireless broadband network         in         Vail, Colorado, which allows us to provide wireless broadband Internet service         in public locations throughout the Vail town limits. We are exploring         opportunities to construct similar networks in other areas.
We         are         currently developing a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service offering         that we plan to offer to our existing CLEC business customers as a low-cost         managed service for both Internet and voice services.
12 Table             of Contents For         additional information on the financial impact of these new offerings, see         Items         1A and 7 of this annual report.
Federal         Financing Programs Certain         of our telephone subsidiaries receive long-term financing from the Rural         Utilities Service (RUS), a federal agency that has historically provided         long-term financing to telephone companies at relatively attractive interest         rates. Approximately 15% of our telephone plant is pledged to secure obligations         of our telephone subsidiaries to the RUS. For additional information regarding         our financing, see our consolidated financial statements included in Item         8         herein.
Sales         and Marketing We         maintain local offices in most of the larger population centers within our         service territories. These offices are typically staffed by local residents         and         provide sales and customer support services in the community. In addition,         our         strategy is to enhance our communications services by offering comprehensive         bundling of services and deploying new technologies to build upon the strong         reputation we enjoy in our markets and to further promote customer loyalty.
Network         Architecture Our         local         exchange carrier networks consist of central office hosts and remote sites,         all         with advanced digital switches (primarily manufactured by Nortel and Siemens)         and operating with licensed software. Our outside plant consists of transport         and distribution delivery networks connecting each of our host central offices         to our remote central offices, and ultimately to our customers. As of December         31, 2006, we maintained over 244,000 miles of copper plant and approximately         19,000 miles of fiber optic plant in our local exchange networks. Our fiber         optic cable is the primary transport technology between our host and remote         central offices and interconnection points with other incumbent carriers.         For         additional related information, see Services - Fiber Transport and         CLEC.
Regulation         and Competition Relating to Incumbent Local Exchange         Operations Traditionally,         LECs operated as regulated monopolies having the exclusive right and         responsibility to provide local telephone services. (These LECs are sometimes         referred to below as incumbent LECs or ILECs). Consequently, most of our         intrastate telephone operations have traditionally been regulated extensively         by         various state regulatory agencies (generally called public service commissions         or public utility commissions) and our interstate operations have been regulated         by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934. As we discuss in greater         detail         below, passage of the 1996 Act, coupled with state legislative and regulatory         initiatives and technological changes, fundamentally altered the telephone         industry by reducing the regulation of LECs and attracting a substantial         increase in the number of competitors and capital invested in existing and         new         services. We anticipate that these trends toward reduced regulation and         increased competition will continue.
13 Table             of Contents The         following description discusses some of the major industry regulations that         affect us, but numerous other regulations not discussed below could also         impact         us. Some legislation and regulations are currently the subject of judicial         proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals which could         substantially change the manner in which the communications industry operates.         Neither the outcome of any of these developments, nor their potential impact         on         us, can be predicted at this time. Regulation can change rapidly in the         communications industry, and such changes may have an adverse effect on us         in         the future. See Item 1A of this annual report below.
State         regulation .         The         local service rates and intrastate access charges of substantially all of         our         telephone subsidiaries are regulated by state regulatory commissions which         typically have the power to grant and revoke franchises authorizing companies         to         provide communications services. Most commissions have traditionally regulated         pricing through rate of return regulation that focuses on authorized levels of         earnings by LECs. Historically, most of these commissions also (i) regulated         the         purchase and sale of LECs, (ii) prescribed depreciation rates and certain         accounting procedures, (iii) enforced laws requiring LECs to provide universal         service under publicly filed tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions         and         prices of their LEC services, (iv) oversaw implementation of several federal         telecommunications laws and (v) regulated various other matters, including         certain service standards and operating procedures.
In         recent         years, state legislatures and regulatory commissions in most of the 21 states         in         which our telephone subsidiaries operate have either reduced the regulation         of         LECs or have announced their intention to do so, and we expect this trend         will         continue. Essentially, such relief comes in two forms: (i) full or partial         deregulation through legislation; or (ii) the ability to opt in to existing         state alternative regulation through a regulatory proceeding. Wisconsin,         Missouri, Alabama, Arkansas and several other states have implemented laws         or         rulings which require or permit LECs to either be deregulated for pricing         or opt         out of rate of return regulation in exchange for agreeing to alternative forms         of regulation which typically permit the LEC greater freedom to establish         local         service rates in exchange for agreeing not to charge rates in excess of         specified caps. As discussed further below, subsidiaries operating over 65%         of         our access lines in various states have agreed to be governed by alternative         regulation plans, and we continue to explore our options for similar treatment         in other states. We believe that reduced regulatory oversight of certain         of our         telephone operations may allow us to offer new and competitive services faster         than under the traditional regulatory process. For a discussion of legislative,         regulatory and technological changes that have introduced competition into         the         local exchange industry, see Developments Affecting         Competition.
14 Table             of Contents Alternative         regulation plans govern some or all of the access lines operated by us in         Wisconsin, Missouri, Alabama and Arkansas, which are our four largest markets.         The following summary describes the alternative regulation plans applicable         to         us in these states.
Our         Wisconsin access lines, except for those acquired from Verizon in 2000 (which         continue to be regulated under rate of return regulation), are regulated under         various alternative regulation plans. Each of these alternative regulation         plans         permits us to adjust local rates within specified parameters if we meet certain         quality-of-service and infrastructure-development commitments. These plans         also         include initiatives designed to promote competition.
All         of         our Missouri LECs are regulated under a price-cap regulation plan whereby         basic         service rates are adjusted annually based on an inflation-based factor;         non-basic services may be increased without restriction up to 5% annually.         If         the inflation-based factor were to decline as it has done in recent years,         our         revenues would be negatively impacted.
In         2005,         the state of Alabama passed legislation that essentially allowed telephone         companies the option to phase in deregulation of certain LEC services. In         February 2007, our Alabama LECs deregulated all local services (including         bundled services) except for certain basic telephone and optional calling         services. Certain basic telephone and optional calling services continue         to be         regulated and subject to a price cap.
Our         Arkansas LECs, excluding one property acquired from Verizon in 2000, are         regulated under an alternative regulation plan under which rates can be adjusted         based on an inflation-based factor. Other local rates can be adjusted without         commission approval; however, such rates are subject to commission review         under         certain conditions.
Notwithstanding         the movement toward alternative regulation, LECs operating approximately         34% of         our total access lines continue to be subject to rate of return regulation for         intrastate purposes. These LECs remain subject to the powers of state regulatory         commissions to conduct earnings reviews and adjust service rates, either         of         which could lead to revenue reductions.
Federal         regulation .         Our         telephone subsidiaries are required to comply with the Communications Act         of         1934, which requires us to offer services at just and reasonable rates and         on         non-discriminatory terms, as well as the 1996 Act, which amended the         Communications Act to promote competition.
The         FCC         regulates interstate services provided by our telephone subsidiaries primarily         by regulating the interstate access charges that we bill to long distance         companies and other communications companies for use of our network in         connection with the origination and termination of interstate voice and data         transmissions. Additionally, the FCC has prescribed certain rules and         regulations for telephone companies, including a uniform system of accounts         and         rules regarding the separation of costs between jurisdictions and, ultimately,         between interstate services. LECs must obtain FCC approval to use certain         radio         frequencies, or to transfer control of any such licenses. The FCC retains         the         right to revoke these licenses if a carrier materially violates relevant         legal         requirements.
15 Table             of Contents The         FCC         requires price-cap regulation of interstate access rates for the Regional         Bell         Operating Companies, and permits it for all other LECs. Under price-cap         regulation, limits imposed on a companys interstate rates are adjusted         periodically to reflect inflation, productivity improvement and changes in         certain non-controllable costs. We have not elected price-cap regulation         for our         incumbent operations. However, the properties we acquired from Verizon in         2002         have continued to operate under price-cap regulation, as permitted under         FCC         rules for acquired properties. All of our other operations continue to be         governed by traditional rate-of-return regulation for interstate access charges,         which permit us to set rates based upon an authorized rate of return of         11.25%.
In         2003,         the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation proceeding with the ultimate         goal of creating a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications         industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, or carrying         telecommunications traffic. The FCC has received intercarrier compensation         proposals from several industry groups, and in early 2005 solicited comments         on         all proposals previously submitted to it. Industry negotiations are continuing         with the goal of developing a consensus plan that addresses the concerns         of         carriers from all industry segments. In July 2006, the National Association         of         Regulatory Utility Commissioners Task Force on Intercarrier Compensation filed         an industry-sponsored plan called the Missoula Plan which proposes         comprehensive intercarrier compensation reform. In summary, the Missoula         Plan         seeks to reduce rates carriers charge one another to complete and terminate         calls between networks, increases end-user retail rates and creates additional         funding through an expanded universal service-like mechanism. The FCC is         currently seeking comments from the industry regarding the impact of adopting         the proposal. While we support certain key concepts of the proposal, we do         not         believe the plan in its present form is an equitable solution for intercarrier         compensation reform. Until the FCCs proceeding concludes and the changes, if         any, to the existing rules are established, we cannot estimate the impact         it         will have on our results of operations.
In         December 2005, a group of six mid-sized carriers, including us, filed proposed         rules with the FCC regarding phantom traffic. Phantom traffic generally         refers to telecommunications calls that cannot be billed properly to responsible         carriers by other carriers in the call path because the traffic is mislabeled,         unlabeled or improperly routed. Such proposal calls on the FCC to implement         updated rules that require carriers to accurately identify, label and route         network traffic so that appropriate bills can be created.In late 2006, the         FCC opened a separate phantom traffic proceeding with the intent of formalizing         potential phantom traffic rules for the industry. Until the FCC  s phantom         traffic         proceeding concludes and the changes, if any, to the existing rules are         established, we cannot estimate the impact they will have on our results         of         operations.
As         discussed further below, certain providers of competitive communications         services are currently not required to compensate ILECs for the use of their         networks.
16 Table             of Contents All         forms         of federal support available to ILECs are currently available to any local         competitor that qualifies as an eligible telecommunications carrier. This         support could encourage additional competitors to enter our high-cost service         areas, and, as discussed further below, place additional financial pressure         on         the FCCs support programs.
Our         operations and those of all communications carriers also may be impacted         by         legislation and regulation imposing new or greater obligations related to         assisting law enforcement, bolstering homeland security, minimizing         environmental impacts, or addressing other issues that impact our business,         including the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, and laws         governing local number portability and customer proprietary network information         requirements. These laws and regulations may cause us to incur additional         costs.
Universal         service support funds, revenue sharing arrangements and related         matters .         A         significant number of our telephone subsidiaries recover a portion of their         costs from the federal Universal Service Fund (the USF) and from similar state universal support mechanisms, which receive their funding from fees charged to         interexchange carriers and LECs. Disbursements from these programs traditionally         have allowed LECs serving small communities and rural areas to provide         communications services on terms and at prices reasonably comparable to those         available in urban areas.
The         table         below sets forth the amounts received by our telephone subsidiaries in 2006         and         2005 from federal and state universal support programs.
Year                     ended December 31, 2006 2005 Support                     Program Amount Received %                     of Total 2006 Operating Revenues Amount Received %                     of Total 2005 Operating Revenues (amounts                     in millions) USF                     High Cost Loop Support $ 163.1 6.6 % $ 174.9 7.1 % Other                     Federal Support Programs 134.6 5.5 % 139.2 5.6 % Total                     Federal Support Receipts 297.7 12.1 % 314.1 12.7 % State                     Support Programs 36.2 1.5 % 37.6 1.5 % TOTAL $ 333.9 13.6 % $ 351.7 14.2 % Federal         USF programs have recently undergone substantial changes, and are expected         to         experience more changes in the coming years. As mandated by the 1996 Act,         in May         2001 the FCC modified its existing universal service support mechanism for         rural         telephone companies by adopting an interim mechanism for a five-year period         based on embedded, or historical, costs that provides relatively predictable         levels of support to many LECs, including substantially all of our LECs.         In May         2006, the FCC extended this interim mechanism until such time that new high-cost         support rules are adopted for rural telephone companies.
17 Table             of Contents Wireless         and other competitive service providers continue to seek eligible         telecommunications carrier status in order to receive USF support, which,         coupled with changes in usage of telecommunications services, have placed         stress         on the funding mechanism of the USF, which is subject to annual caps on         disbursements. These developments have placed additional financial pressure         on         the amount of money that is necessary and available to provide support to         all         eligible service providers, including support payments we receive from the         USF         High Cost Loop support program.
A         significant portion of our support payments have varied over time based on         our         average cost to serve customers compared to national cost averages. Under         the         USF High Cost Loop program, which is the USFs principal support program, our         payments from the USF will decrease if national average costs per loop increase         and our average costs per loop remain constant (or decrease). Increases in         the         nationwide average cost per loop factor used to allocate funds among all         USF         recipients caused our revenues from the USF High Cost Loop support program         to         decrease in 2005 and 2006 from the amounts received in the prior year. However,         based on recent FCC filings, we anticipate our 2007 revenues from the USF         High         Cost Loop support program will approximate our 2006 levels.
In         late         2002, the FCC requested that the Federal-State Joint Board (FSJB) on Universal         Service review various FCC rules governing high cost universal service support,         including rules regarding eligibility to receive support payments in markets         served by LECs and competitive carriers. In early 2003, the FSJB issued a         notice         for public comment on whether present rules fulfill their purpose or should         be         modified. During 2004, the FSJB recommended a comprehensive general review         of         the high-cost support mechanisms for rural and non-rural carriers and requested         comments on the FCCs current rules for the provision of high-cost support for         rural companies, including comments on whether eligibility requirements should         be amended in a manner that would adversely affect larger rural LECs such         as us.         In addition, the FCC has taken various other steps in anticipation of         restructuring universal service support mechanisms, which in the aggregate         could         substantially impact these support payments.
In         August         2005, the FSJB sought comments on four separate proposals to modify the         distribution of High Cost Loop support funds. Each of the proposals provides         the         state public service commissions a greater role in the support distribution         process, which would remain subject to specific FCC guidelines. In August         2006,         the FSJB sought comment on the viability of using competitive bidding to         determine the amount of high-cost funding for all eligible carriers. We         anticipate that the FSJB will make reform suggestions to the FCC during 2007,         at         which time the FCC would be required to seek comments. Due to the pending         nature         of these proposals, we cannot estimate the impact that such proposals would         have         on our operations. In addition, there are a number of judicial appeals         challenging several aspects of the FCCs universal service rules and various         Congressional proposals seeking to substantially modify USF programs, none         of         which have been resolved at this time. We have been and will continue to         be         active in monitoring these developments.
18 Table             of Contents In         2004,         the FCC mandated changes in the administration of the universal service support         programs that temporarily suspended the disbursement of funds under the USFs         E-rate program (for service to Schools and Libraries), and, more significantly,         created questions that these administrative changes could similarly delay         the         disbursement of funds to LECs from the Universal Service High Cost Loop support         program. Congress has passed bills in recent years granting one-year exemptions         from the federal law that impacted the E-rate program. Such a bill was also         passed in 2007, extending the exemption through December 31, 2007. Although         we         expect funding from this program to continue, we cannot assure you that the         lack         of a definitive resolution of this issue will not delay or impede the         disbursement of funds in the future.
In         the         second quarter of 2005, the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) adopted         an order that transferred the previously-existing $42 million Louisiana Optional         Service Fund (LOS Fund) into a state universal service fund effective August         31, 2005. Prior to this change, we received approximately $21 million annually         from the LOS Fund. Thus far, we have received similar amounts under the new         fund, and currently expect this to continue. The new state universal service         fund expands the base of contributors to all telecommunications service         providers operating in the state. In June 2005, two telecommunications service         providers separately served the LPSC with an appeal of the new fund, both         of         which were dismissed by the Louisiana Supreme Court. The LOS Fund is subject         to         an annual review by the LPSC; as such, there can be no assurance that the         new         fund will remain as adopted by the LPSC or that funding levels will remain         at         current levels.
Some         of         our telephone subsidiaries operate in states where traditional cost recovery         mechanisms, including rate structures, are under evaluation or have been         modified. See  State Regulation. There can be no assurance that these states         will continue to provide for cost recovery at current levels.
All         of         our interstate network access revenues are based on access charges, cost         separation studies or special settlement arrangements, many of which are         administered by the FCC or NECA. See Services.
Certain         long distance carriers continue to request that certain of our LECs reduce         intrastate access tariffed rates. Long distance carriers have also aggressively         pursued regulatory or legislative changes that would reduce access rates.         However, in light of pending intercarrier compensation reform that would         address         intrastate access charges, most states are deferring action until they receive         direction from the FCC. See Services - Network Access above for additional         information.
19 Table             of Contents Developments         affecting competition .         Over         the past decade, fundamental technological, regulatory and legislative changes         have significantly impacted the communications industry, and we expect these         changes will continue. Primarily as a result of regulatory and technological         changes, competition has been introduced and encouraged in each sector of         the         communications industry in recent years. As a result, we increasingly face         competition from other communication service providers.
Wireless         telephone services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition         with LEC services, especially since wireless carriers have begun to compete         effectively on the basis of price with more traditional telephone services.         As a         result, some customers have chosen to completely forego use of traditional         wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service for voice         services. This trend is more pronounced among residential customers, which         comprise 74% of our access line customers. We anticipate this trend will         continue, particularly if wireless service providers continue to expand their         coverage areas, reduce their rates, improve the quality of their services,         and         offer enhanced new services. Most of our access line customers are currently         capable of receiving wireless services from a competitive service provider.         Technological and regulatory developments in cellular telephone, personal         communications services, digital microwave, satellite, coaxial cable, fiber         optics, local multipoint distribution services and other wired and wireless         technologies are expected to further permit the development of alternatives         to         traditional landline services. In 2005, we began offering our CenturyTel         branded         wireless reseller service and, by the end of December 2006, we offered wireless         service through this reselling arrangement to markets serving approximately         30%         of our residential access lines.
The         1996         Act, which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities         to the LECs network and to take various other steps that are designed to         promote competition, imposes several duties on a LEC if it receives a specific         request from another entity which seeks to connect with or provide services         using the LECs network. In addition, each incumbent LEC is obligated to (i)         negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith, (ii) provide         nondiscriminatory unbundled access to all aspects of the LECs network, (iii)         offer resale of its telecommunications services at wholesale rates and (iv)         permit competitors, on terms and conditions (including rates) that are just,         reasonable and nondiscriminatory, to collocate their physical plant on the         LECs         property, or provide virtual collocation if physical collocation is not         practicable. During 2003, the FCC released new rules outlining the obligations         of incumbent LECs to lease to competitors elements of their circuit-switched         networks on an unbundled basis at prices that substantially limited the         profitability of these arrangements to incumbent LECs. On March 2, 2004,         a         federal appellate court vacated significant portions of these rules, including         the standards used to determine which unbundled network elements must be         made         available to competitors. In response to this court decision, on February         4,         2005, the FCC released rules (effective March 11, 2005) that required incumbent         LECs to lease a network element only in those situations where competing         carriers genuinely would be impaired without access to such network element,         and         where the unbundling would not interfere with the development of         facilities-based competition. These rules are further designed to remove         LECs         unbundling obligations over time as competing carriers deploy their own networks         and local exchange competition increases.
20 Table             of Contents Under         the         1996 Acts rural telephone company exemption, approximately 50% of our telephone         access lines are exempt from certain of the 1996 Acts interconnection         requirements unless and until the appropriate state regulatory commission         overrides the exemption upon receipt from a competitor of a bona fide request         meeting certain criteria. States are permitted to adopt laws or regulations         that         provide for greater competition than is mandated under the 1996         Act.
In         addition to these changes in federal regulation, all of the 21 states in         which         we provide telephone services have taken legislative or regulatory steps         to         further introduce competition into the LEC business.
As         a         result of these regulatory developments, ILECs increasingly face competition         from competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), particularly in densely         populated areas. CLECs provide competing services through reselling the ILECs local services, through use of the ILECs unbundled network elements or through         their own facilities. The number of companies which have requested authorization         to provide local exchange service in our service areas has increased in recent         years, especially in our markets acquired from Verizon in 2002 and 2000.         We         anticipate that similar action may be taken by other competitors in the future,         especially if all forms of federal support available to ILECs continue to         remain         available to these competitors.
Recent         technological developments have led to the development of new services that         compete with traditional LEC services. Technological improvements have enabled         cable television companies to provide telephone service over their cable         networks, and several national cable companies have aggressively pursued         this         opportunity. As of December 31, 2006, we believe that nearly 30% of our access         lines currently face competition from cable voice offerings. Additionally,         several large electric utilities have recently announced plans to offer         communications services that compete with LECs.
Recent         improvements in the quality of VoIP service have led several cable, Internet,         data and other communications companies, as well as start-up companies, to         substantially increase their offerings of VoIP service to business and         residential customers. VoIP providers route calls partially or wholly over         the         Internet, without use of ILEC's circuit switches and, in certain cases, without         use of ILEC's networks to carry their communications traffic. VoIP providers         frequently use existing broadband networks to deliver flat-rate, all distance         calling plans that may offer features that cannot readily be provided by         traditional LECs. These plans may also be priced competitively or below those         currently charged for traditional local and long distance telephone services         for         several reasons, including lower operating costs. In December 2003, the FCC         initiated rulemaking that is expected to address the effect of VoIP on         intercarrier compensation, universal service and emergency services. On March         10, 2004, the FCC released a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment         on         the appropriate regulatory treatment of VoIP service and related issues.         Although the FCCs rulemaking regarding VoIP-enabled services remains pending,         the FCC has adopted orders establishing broad guidelines for the regulation         of         such services, including (i) an April 2004 order that found an IP-telephony         service using the public switched telephone network to be a regulated         telecommunications service subject to interstate access charges, (ii) a November         2004 order that Internet-based services provided by Vonage Holdings Corporation         should be subject to federal rather than state regulation and (iii) a June         2005         order requiring all VoIP service providers whose services are interconnected         to         the public switched telephone network to provide E-911 services to their         customers. In addition, in March 2005, Level 3 Communications, Inc. withdrew         its         petition requesting the FCC to forbear from imposing interstate and intrastate         access charges on Internet-based calls that originate or terminate on the         public         switched telephone network. There can be no assurance that future rulemaking         will be on terms favorable to ILECs, or that VoIP providers will not         successfully compete for our customers.
21 Table             of Contents Similar         to us, many cable, entertainment, technology or other communications companies         that previously offered a limited range of services are now offering diversified         bundles of services, either through their own networks, reselling arrangements         or joint ventures. As such, a growing number of companies are competing to         serve         the communications needs of the same customer base. Several of these companies         started offering full service bundles before us, which could give them an         advantage in building customer loyalty. Such activities will continue to         place         downward pressure on the demand for our access lines.
In         addition to facing direct competition from those providers described above,         ILECs increasingly face competition from alternate communication systems         constructed by long distance carriers, large customers or alternative access         vendors. These systems, which have become more prevalent as a result of the         1996         Act, are capable of originating or terminating calls without use of the ILECs networks or switching services. Other potential sources of competition include         non-carrier systems that are capable of bypassing ILECs local networks, either         partially or completely, through substitution of special access for switched         access or through concentration of telecommunications traffic on a few of         the         ILECs access lines. We anticipate that all these trends will continue and lead         to decreased use of our networks.
Significant         competitive factors in the local telephone industry include pricing, packaging         of services and features, quality and convenience of service and meeting         customer needs such as simplified billing and timely response to service         calls.
As         the         telephone industry increasingly experiences competition, the size and resources         of each respective competitor may increasingly influence its prospects. Many         companies currently providing or planning to provide competitive communication         services have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than         we do         or own larger or more diverse networks than ours. In addition, many of them         are         not subject to the same regulatory constraints we are.
22 Table             of Contents Competition         can harm us by causing us to lose customers, or by causing us to lower prices         or         increase our capital or operating expenses to retain customers. Competing         communications services, such as wireless, VoIP, electronic mail and optional         calling services, can also reduce usage of our network and thereby decrease         our         network access revenues. Competition can also cause customers to reduce either         usage of our services or switch to less profitable services, and could impede         our ability to diversity into new lines of business dominated by incumbent         providers.
We         anticipate that the traditional operations of LECs will continue to be impacted         by continued regulatory and technological developments affecting the ability         of         LECs to attract and retain customers and the capability of wireless companies,         CLECs, cable television companies, VoIP providers, electric utilities and         others         to provide competitive LEC services. Competition relating to traditional         LEC         services has thus far affected large urban areas to a greater extent than         the         less dense areas in which we operate. We will actively monitor these         developments, observe the effect of emerging competitive trends in larger         markets and continue to evaluate new business opportunities that may arise         out         of future technological, legislative and regulatory developments.
While         we         expect our operating revenues in 2007 to continue to experience downward         pressure primarily due to continued access line losses and reduced network         access revenues, we expect such declines to be partially offset primarily         due to         increased demand for our fiber transport, high-speed Internet and other         nonregulated product offerings (including our new video and wireless initiatives         mentioned above).
Regulation         and Competition Relating to Other Operations Long         Distance Operations .         We         offer intra-LATA, intrastate and interstate long distance services. State         public         service commissions generally regulate intra-LATA toll calls within the same         LATA and inter-LATA toll calls between different LATAs located in the same         state. Federal regulators have jurisdiction over interstate toll calls. Recent         state regulatory changes have increased competition to provide intra-LATA         toll         services in our local exchange markets. Competition for intrastate and         interstate long distance services has been intense for several years, and         focuses primarily on price and pricing plans, and secondarily on customer         service, reliability and communications quality. Traditionally, our principal         competitors for providing long distance services were large long distance         companies such as AT&T, regional phone companies and dial-around resellers.         Increasingly, however, we have experienced competition from newer sources,         including wireless companies offering attractively-priced calling plans.         Technological substitutions, including VoIP and electronic mail, have further         reduced demand for traditional long distance services.
Data         Operations .         In         connection with our data business, we face competition from Internet service         providers, satellite companies and cable companies which use wired or wireless         technologies to offer dial-up Internet access services or high-speed broadband         services. As of December 31, 2006, we believe approximately 57% of our local         exchange markets are overlapped by cable systems offering data services         competitive with ours. Many of these competitors offer content that we cannot         match. Moreover, many of these providers have traditionally been subject         to less         rigorous regulatory scrutiny than our subsidiaries, although 2005 FCC rule         changes classifying our high-speed offering as an information service has         helped reduce regulatory disparities. The FCC is currently conducting several         other rulemakings considering the regulatory treatment of broadband services,         the outcomes of which could reduce our pricing flexibility or could         significantly impact our competitive position.
23 Table             of Contents Fiber         Transport Operations .         When         our fiber transport networks are used to provide intrastate telecommunications         services, we must comply with state requirements for telecommunications         utilities, including state tariffing requirements. To the extent our facilities         are used to provide interstate communications, we are subject to federal         regulation as a non-dominant common carrier. Due largely to excess capacity,         the         fiber transport industry is highly competitive. Our primary competitors are         from         other communications companies, many of whom operate networks and have resources         much larger than ours. In addition, new IP-based services may enable new         entrants to transport data at prices lower than we currently offer.
CLEC         Operations .         Competitive local exchange carriers are subject to certain reporting and         other         regulatory requirements by the FCC and state public service commissions,         although the degree of regulation is much less substantial than that imposed         on         ILECs operating in the same markets. Local governments also frequently require         competitive local exchange carriers to obtain licenses or franchises regulating         the use of rights-of-way necessary to install and operate their networks.         In         each of our CLEC markets, we face competition from the ILEC, which traditionally         has long-standing relationships with its customers. Over time, we may also         face         competition from one or more other CLECs, or from other communications providers         who can provide comparable services.
Other         Operations .         Similar         to our CLEC business, we may be required to obtain licenses or franchises         to         enter new markets for our switched digital television and wireless broadband         services, which could delay our rollout of these offerings. The wireless         industry, in which our resold wireless services competes, is highly competitive,         which will substantially limit our operating margins.
24 Table             of Contents OTHER         DEVELOPMENTS OR MATTERS In         February 2006, our board of directors approved a $1.0 billion stock repurchase         program. We purchased the first $500 million of common stock in late February         2006 under accelerated share repurchase agreements with investment banks         and,         beginning in the third quarter of 2006, we began repurchasing the remaining         $500         million balance of the $1.0 billion program through open market transactions.         During 2006, we repurchased a total of $802.2 million of common stock (21.4         million shares). We previously repurchased approximately $401.0 million,         $186.7         million and $437.5 million of our shares under separate repurchase programs         approved in February 2004, February 2005 and May 2005, respectively. For         additional information, see Liquidity and Capital Resources included in Item         7         of this annual report.
We         have         certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the         protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2006 have not         been         material and we currently have no reason to believe that such costs will         become         material.
For         additional information concerning our business and properties, see Items         2 and 7         elsewhere herein, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes 2,         4, 5,         and 16 thereto set forth in Item 8 elsewhere herein.

Risk                   Factors RISK         FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS Risk         Factors Any         of         the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business,         financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects. The risks         described below are not the only risks facing us. Please be aware that         additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we         currently deem to be immaterial could also materially and adversely affect         our         business operations.
Risks         Related to Our Business If         we continue to experience access line losses like we have in the past several         years, our revenues, earnings and cash flows may be adversely         impacted.
Our         business generates a substantial portion of its revenues by delivering voice         and         data services over access lines. We have experienced access line losses over         the         past several years, including a 4.8% decline (excluding the effect of certain         adjustments) during the year ended December 31, 2006, due to a number of         factors, including increased competition and wireless and broadband         substitution, which are described further below. We expect to continue to         experience access line losses in our markets for an unforeseen period of         time.         Our inability to retain access lines could adversely impact our revenues,         earnings and cash flow from operations.
We         face competition, which we expect to intensify.
As         a         result of various technological, regulatory and other changes, the         telecommunications industry has become increasingly competitive, and we expect         these trends to continue. In our LEC markets, we face competition from wireless         telephone services, which we expect to increase if wireless providers continue         to expand and improve their network coverage, lower their prices and offer         enhanced services. In certain of our LEC markets, we face competition from         cable         television operators and CLECs. Over time, we expect to face additional local         exchange competition from more recent market entrants, including VoIP providers         and electric utilities, and we expect continued competition from alternative         networks or non-carrier systems designed to reduce demand for our switching         or         access services. The Internet, long distance and data services markets are         also         highly competitive, and we expect that competition will intensify in these         and         other markets that we serve. The recent proliferation of companies offering         integrated service offerings has further intensified competition in the markets         we serve.
26 Table             of Contents We         expect         competition to intensify as a result of new competitors and the development         of         new products and services. We cannot predict which future products or services         will be important to maintain our competitive position or what funding will         be         required to develop and provide these products or services. Our ability to         compete successfully will depend on how well we market our products and services         and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive and         technological factors affecting the industry, including changes in regulation         (which may affect us differently from our competitors), changes in consumer         preferences or demographics, and changes in the product offerings or pricing         strategies of our competitors.
Many         of         our current and potential competitors have market presence, engineering,         technical and marketing capabilities and financial, personnel and other         resources substantially greater than ours. In addition, some of our competitors         own larger and more diverse networks, can conduct operations or raise capital         at         a lower cost than we can, are subject to less regulation, have lower benefit         plan costs, or have substantially stronger brand names. Consequently, some         competitors may be able to charge lower prices for their products and services,         to offer more attractive service bundles, to develop and expand their         communications and network infrastructures more quickly, to adapt more swiftly         to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, and         to         devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and         services than we can.
Competition         could adversely impact us in several ways, including (i) the loss of customers         and market share, (ii) the possibility of customers reducing their usage         of our         services or shifting to less profitable services, (iii) reduced traffic on         our         networks, (iv)our need to expend substantial time or money on new capital         improvement projects, (v) our need to lower prices or increase marketing         expenses to remain competitive and (vi) our inability to diversify by         successfully offering new products or services.
We         could be harmed by rapid changes in technology.
The         communications industry is experiencing significant technological changes,         particularly in the areas of VoIP, data transmission and wireless         communications. Recently, several large electric utilities have announced         plans         to offer communications services that will compete with LECs. Some of our         competitors may enjoy network advantages that will enable them to provide         services more efficiently or at lower cost. Rapid changes in technology could         result in the development of products or services that compete with or displace         those offered by traditional LECs, or that enable current customers to reduce         or         bypass use of our networks. We cannot predict with certainty which technological         changes will provide the greatest threat to our competitive position. We         may not         be able to obtain timely access to new technology on satisfactory terms or         incorporate new technology into our systems in a cost effective manner, or         at         all. If we cannot develop new products to keep pace with technological advances,         or if such products are not widely embraced by our customers, we could be         adversely impacted.
27 Table             of Contents We         cannot assure you that our diversification efforts will be         successful.
Due         to         the above-cited changes, the telephone industry has recently experienced         a         decline in access lines, intrastate minutes of use and long distance minutes         of         use. While we have not in the past suffered as much as a number of other         ILECs         from recent industry challenges, the recent decline in access lines and usage,         coupled with the other changes resulting from competitive, technological         and         regulatory developments, could materially adversely effect our core business         and         future prospects. Our access lines declined 4.8% in 2006 and we expect our         access lines to decline between 4.5% and 6.0% in 2007. We also earned less         intrastate revenues in 2006 due to reductions in intrastate minutes of use         (partially due to the displacement of minutes of use by wireless, electronic         mail and other optional calling services). We believe our intrastate minutes         of         use will continue to decline, although the magnitude of such decrease is         uncertain.
We         have         traditionally sought growth largely through acquisitions of properties similar         to those currently operated by us. However, we cannot assure you that properties         will be available for purchase on terms attractive to us, particularly if         they         are burdened by regulations, pricing plans or competitive pressures that         are new         or different from those historically applicable to our incumbent properties.         Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will be able to arrange additional         financing on terms acceptable to us.
In         recent         years, we have attempted to broaden our service and product offerings. During         2005, we began providing co-branded satellite television services and reselling         wireless services as part of our bundled product and service offerings. Our         reliance on other companies and their networks to provide these services         could         constrain our flexibility and limit the profitability of these new offerings.         In         addition, during 2005 we launched our facilities-based digital video offering         to         select markets in Wisconsin and initiated a second switched digital video         trial         in early 2007. As discussed further under the heading Operations - Services -         Recent Product Developments in Item 1 of this annual report, we have also         recently begun offering wireless broadband and other new communication services.         We anticipate these new offerings will generate lower profit margins than         many         of our traditional services. As such, to the extent revenues from these new         offerings replace revenues lost from declines in our traditional LEC business,         our overall profit margins will decline. We cannot assure you that our recent         diversification efforts will be successful.
Future         deterioration in our financial performance could adversely impact our credit         ratings, our cost of capital and our access to the capital         markets.
28 Table             of Contents Our         future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our         operations.
In         the         past several years, we have expanded our operations through acquisitions         and new         product and service offerings, and we may pursue similar opportunities in         the         future. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage our         expansion opportunities, including our ability to:  retain                   and attract technological, managerial and other key personnel  effectively                   manage our day to day operations while attempting to execute our                   business                   strategy of expanding our emerging                   businesses  realize                   the projected growth and revenue targets developed by management                   for our                   newly acquired and emerging businesses,                   and  continue                   to identify new acquisition or growth opportunities that we can                   finance,                   consummate and operate on attractive terms.
Expansion         opportunities pose substantial challenges for us to integrate new operations         into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to successfully         monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality,         and to         maintain other necessary internal controls. In addition, acquisitions entail         the         additional risk that we will incur unanticipated liabilities or contingencies         of         the acquired business, unbudgeted expenses or the loss of key employees or         customers. We cannot assure you that our expansion or acquisition opportunities         will be successful, or that we will realize our expected operating efficiencies,         cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits. If we are         not         able to meet these challenges effectively, our results of operations may         be         harmed.
Network         disruptions could adversely affect our operating         results.
To         be         successful, we will need to continue providing our customers with a high         capacity, reliable and secure network. Some of the risks to our network and         infrastructure include:  power                   losses or physical damage to our access lines, whether caused by                   fire,                   adverse weather conditions, terrorism or                   otherwise  capacity                   limitations  software                   and hardware defects  breaches                   of security, including sabotage, tampering, computer viruses and                   break-ins, and  other                   disruptions that are beyond our                   control.
29 Table               of Contents Disruptions         or system failures may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity         for         customers. If service is not restored in a timely manner, agreements with         our         customers or service standards set by state regulatory commissions could         obligate us to provide credits or other remedies, and this would reduce our         revenues or increase our costs. Service disruptions could also damage our         reputation with customers, causing us to lose existing customers or have         difficulty attracting new ones.
Any         failure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure could         harm         our business.
The         capacity, reliability and security of our information technology hardware         and         software infrastructure (including our billing systems) is important to the         operation of our current business, which would suffer in the event of system         failures. Likewise, our ability to expand and update our information technology         infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs are important         to the         continued implementation of our new service offering initiatives. Our inability         to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse         consequences, which could include the delayed implementation of new service         offerings, service or billing interruptions, and the diversion of development         resources.
We         rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors to operate our         business.
We         depend         on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating         to our network infrastructure. If these suppliers experience interruptions         or         other problems delivering or servicing these network components on a timely         basis, our operations could suffer significantly. To the extent that proprietary         technology of a supplier is an integral component of our network, we may         have         limited flexibility to purchase key network components from alternative         suppliers. We also rely on a limited number of other communications companies         in         connection with reselling long distance, wireless and satellite entertainment         services to our customers. In addition, we rely on a limited number of software         vendors to support our business management systems. In the event it becomes         necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to         obtain         satisfactory replacement supplies or services on economically attractive         terms,         on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs or cause disruptions         in         our services.
30 Table             of Contents Our         relationships with other communications companies are material to our operations         and their financial difficulties may adversely affect         us.
We         originate and terminate calls for long distance carriers and other interexchange         carriers over our network in exchange for access charges that represent a         significant portion of our revenues. Should these carriers go bankrupt or         experience substantial financial difficulties, our inability to timely collect         access charges from them could have a negative effect on our business and         results of operations.
In         addition, our LightCore operations carry a significant amount of voice and         data         traffic for larger communications companies. As these larger communications         companies consolidate, it is possible that they could transfer a significant         portion of this traffic from our fiber network to their networks, which could         have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.
We         depend on key members of our senior management team.
Our         success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of a limited         number of senior officers, none of whom are parties to employment agreements.         Competition for senior management in our industry is intense and we may have         difficulty retaining our current senior managers or attracting new ones in         the         event of terminations or resignations.
We         could be affected by certain changes in labor         matters.
At         December 31, 2006, approximately 25% of our employees were members of 12         separate bargaining units represented by two different unions. From time         to         time, our labor agreements with these unions lapse, and we typically negotiate         the terms of new agreements. We cannot predict the outcome of these         negotiations. We may be unable to reach new agreements, and union employees         may         engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially         disrupt our ability to provide services. In addition, new labor agreements         may         impose significant new costs on us, which could impair our financial condition         or results of operations in the future. Moreover, our post-employment benefit         offerings cause us to incur costs not faced by many of our competitors, which         could ultimately hinder our competitive position.
Risks         Related to Our Regulatory Environment Our         revenues could be materially reduced or our expenses materially increased         by         changes in regulations.
The         majority of our revenues are substantially dependent upon regulations which,         if         changed, could result in material revenue reductions. Laws and regulations         applicable to us and our competitors may be, and have been, challenged in         the         courts, and could be changed by federal or state legislators. Any of the         following could significantly impact us: 31 Table             of Contents Risk         of loss or reduction of network access charge revenues.
A         significant portion of our network access revenues are paid to us by intrastate         and interstate long distance carriers for originating and terminating calls         in         the regions we serve. The amount of access charge revenues that we receive         is         based largely on rates set by federal and state regulatory bodies, and such         rates could change. In 2003, the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation         proceeding that is expected to overhaul the current system for compensating         carriers originating, terminating, carrying and delivering telecommunications         traffic. This proceeding could materially impact our results of operations.         In         addition, our financial results could be harmed if carriers that use our         access         services become financially distressed or bypass our networks, either due         to         changes in regulation or other factors. Furthermore, access charges currently         paid to us could be diverted to competitors who enter our markets or expand         their operations, either due to changes in regulation or otherwise.
Risk         of loss or reduction of support fund payments.
We         receive a substantial portion of our revenues from the federal Universal         Service         Fund and, to a lesser extent, intrastate support funds. These governmental         programs are reviewed and amended from time to time, and we cannot assure         you         that they will not be changed or impacted in a manner adverse to us. In August         2004, a federal-state joint board requested comments on the FCCs current rules         for high-cost support payments to rural telephone companies, including comments         on whether eligibility requirements should be amended in a manner that would         adversely affect larger rural LECs such as us. In August 2006, this board         sought         comments on the viability of using competitive bidding to determine the amount         of high-cost funding for all eligible carriers. Recently, several parties         have         objected to the size of the USF or questioned the continued need to maintain         the         program in its current form. Pending judicial appeals and Congressional         proposals create additional uncertainty regarding our future receipt of support         payments. We cannot estimate the impact that these developments will have         on         us.
Recent         changes in the nationwide average cost per loop factors used by the FCC to         allocate support funds have reduced our receipts from the main support program         administered by the federal Universal Service Fund. These changes reduced         our         receipts from such program by $11.8 million in 2006 compared to 2005. In         addition, the number of eligible telecommunications carriers receiving support         payments from this program continues to increase, which, coupled with other         factors, has placed additional financial pressure on the amount of money         that is         necessary and available to provide support payments to all eligible recipients,         including us.
Risk         of loss of statutory exemption from burdensome interconnection rules imposed         on         incumbent local exchange carriers .         Approximately 50% of our telephone access lines are exempt from the 1996         Acts         more burdensome requirements governing the rights of competitors to interconnect         to incumbent local exchange carrier networks and to utilize discrete network         elements of the incumbents network at favorable rates. If state regulators         decide that it is in the publics interest to impose these more burdensome         interconnection requirements on us, we would be required to provide unbundled         network elements to competitors. As a result, more competitors could enter         our         traditional telephone markets than we currently expect, resulting in lower         revenues and higher additional administrative and regulatory         expenses.
32 Table             of Contents Risk         of losses from rate reductions .         Notwithstanding the movement toward alternative state regulation, LECs operating         approximately 34% of our total access lines continue to be subject to rate of         return regulation for intrastate purposes. These LECs remain subject to the         powers of state regulatory commissions to conduct earnings reviews and adjust         service rates, which could lead to revenue reductions. LECs governed by         alternative regulatory plans could also under certain circumstances be ordered         to reduce rates or could experience rate reductions following the lapse of         plans         currently in effect.
The         FCC         regulates tariffs for interstate access and subscriber line charges, both         of         which are components of our revenues. The FCC currently is considering proposals         to reduce interstate access charges for carriers like us. We could be adversely         affected if the FCC lowers interstate access charges without adopting an         adequate revenue replacement mechanism.
Risks         posed by costs of regulatory compliance .         Regulations continue to create significant compliance costs for us. Challenges         to our tariffs by regulators or third parties or delays in obtaining         certifications and regulatory approvals could cause us to incur substantial         legal and administrative expenses, and, if successful, such challenges could         adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge our customers. Our         business also may be impacted by legislation and regulation imposing new         or         greater obligations related to assisting law enforcement, bolstering homeland         security, minimizing environmental impacts, or addressing other issues that         impact our business (including local number portability and customer proprietary         network information requirements). For example, existing provisions of the         Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act require communications         carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities, and services are able         to         facilitate authorized electronic surveillance. We expect our compliance costs         to         increase if future legislation or regulations continue to increase our         obligations to assist other governmental agencies.
Regulatory         changes in the communications industry could adversely affect our business         by         facilitating greater competition against us.
The         1996         Act provides for significant changes and increased competition in the         communications industry, including the local communications and long distance         industries. This Act and the FCCs implementing regulations remain subject to         judicial review and additional rulemakings, thus making it difficult to predict         what effect the legislation will have on us and our competitors. Several         regulatory and judicial proceedings have recently concluded, are underway         or may         soon be commenced, which address issues affecting our operations and those         of         our competitors. Moreover, certain communities nationwide have expressed         an         interest in establishing a municipal telephone utility that would compete         for         customers. We cannot predict the outcome of these developments, nor can we         assure that these changes will not have a material adverse effect on us or         our         industry.
33 Table             of Contents We         are subject to significant regulations that limit our         flexibility.
As         a         diversified full service incumbent local exchange carrier, or ILEC, we have         traditionally been subject to significant regulation that does not apply         to many         of our competitors. For instance, unlike many of our competitors, we are         subject         to federal mandates to share facilities, file and justify tariffs, maintain         certain accounts and file reports, and state requirements that obligate us         to         maintain service standards and limit our ability to change tariffs in a timely         manner. This regulation imposes substantial compliance costs on us and restricts         our ability to raise rates, to compete and to respond rapidly to changing         industry conditions. Although newer alternative forms of regulation permit         us         greater freedoms in several states in which we operate, they nonetheless         typically impose caps on the rates that we can charge our customers. As our         business becomes increasingly competitive, regulatory disparities between         us and         our competitors could impede our ability to compete. Litigation and different         objectives among federal and state regulators could create uncertainty and         impede our ability to respond to new regulations. Moreover, changes in tax         laws,         regulations or policies could increase our tax rate, particularly if state         regulators continue to search for additional revenue sources to address budget         shortfalls. We are unable to predict the future actions of the various         regulatory bodies that govern us, but such actions could materially affect         our         business.
We         are subject to franchising requirements that could impede our expansion         opportunities.
We         may be         required to obtain from municipal authorities operating franchises to install         or         expand facilities. Some of these franchises may require us to pay franchise         fees. These franchising requirements generally apply to our fiber transport         and         CLEC operations, and to our emerging switched digital television and wireless         broadband businesses. These requirements could delay us in expanding our         operations or increase the costs of providing these services.
We         will be exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by         Section         404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Changing         laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public         disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations implemented         by the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange and the Public Company Accounting         Oversight Board, are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing         legal         and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time consuming.         These regulations require us to evaluate our internal controls system to         allow         management to report on, and our independent auditors to attest to, our internal         controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The annual         evaluation of our internal controls may result in identifying material         weaknesses in our internal controls. While we have thus far been able to         complete our annual assessments in a timely manner, there is no guarantee         that         we will do so in the future. Any future failure to successfully or timely         complete these annual assessments could subject us to sanctions or investigation         by regulatory authorities. Any such action could adversely affect our financial         results or investors confidence in us, and could cause our stock price to fall.         If we fail to maintain effective controls and procedures, we may be unable         to         provide financial information in a timely and reliable manner, which could         in         certain instances limit our ability to borrow or raise capital.
34 Table               of Contents For         a         more thorough discussion of the regulatory issues that may affect our business,         see Operations above.
Other         Risks We         have a substantial amount of indebtedness.
We         have a         substantial amount of indebtedness. This could hinder our ability to adjust         to         changing market and economic conditions, as well as our ability to access         the         capital markets to refinance maturing debt in the ordinary course of business.         In connection with executing our business strategies, we are continuously         evaluating the possibility of acquiring additional communications assets,         and we         may elect to finance acquisitions by incurring additional indebtedness.         Moreover, to respond to the competitive challenges discussed above, we may         be         required to raise substantial additional capital to finance new product or         service offerings. Our ability to arrange additional financing will depend         on,         among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as         prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot         assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms         acceptable to us or at all. If we are able to obtain additional financing,         our         credit ratings could be adversely affected. As a result, our borrowing costs         would likely increase, our access to capital may be adversely affected and         our         ability to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness could be         adversely affected.
Our         agreements and organizational documents and applicable law could limit another         partys ability to acquire us at a premium.
Under         our         articles of incorporation, each share of common stock that has been beneficially         owned by the same person or entity continually since May 30, 1987 generally         entitles the holder to ten votes on all matters duly submitted to a vote         of         shareholders. As of January 31, 2007, we estimate that the holders of our         ten-vote shares held approximately 31% of our total voting power. In addition,         a         number of other provisions in our agreements and organizational documents         and         various provisions of applicable law may delay, defer or prevent a future         takeover of CenturyTel unless the takeover is approved by our board of         directors. This could deprive our shareholders of any related takeover         premium.
35 Table             of Contents We         face other risks.
The         list         of risks above is not exhaustive, and you should be aware that we face various         other risks.

For         additional information, see the description of our business included above,         as         well as Item 7 of this report. Due to these uncertainties, there can be no         assurance that our anticipated results will occur, that our judgments or         assumptions will prove correct, or that unforeseen developments will not         occur.         Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any of our         forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Additional         risks that we currently deem immaterial or that are not presently known to         us         could also cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected         in         our forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise         any of our forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result         of new         information, future events or developments, changed circumstances, or         otherwise.
Investors         should also be aware that while we do, at various times, communicate with         securities analysts, it is against our policy to disclose to them any material         non-public information or other confidential information. Accordingly, investors         should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by an         analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report.

Properties.
Our         properties consist principally of telephone lines, central office equipment,         and         land and buildings related to telephone operations. As of December 31, 2006         and         2005, our gross property, plant and equipment of approximately $7.9 billion         and         $7.8 billion, respectively, consisted of the following: December                   31, 2006 2005 Cable                   and wire 53.5 % 52.9 Central                   office 32.0 32.4 General                   support 9.6 9.9 Fiber                   transport 2.8 2.4 Construction                   in progress 0.7 1.0 Other 1.4 1.4 100.0 100.0 Cable         and wire facilities consist primarily of buried cable and aerial cable, poles,         wire, conduit and drops used in providing local and long distance services.         Central office consists primarily of switching equipment, circuit equipment         and related facilities. General support consists primarily of land, buildings,         tools, furnishings, fixtures, motor vehicles and work equipment. Fiber         transport consists of network assets and equipment to provide fiber transport         services. Construction in progress includes property of the foregoing         categories that has not been placed in service because it is still under         construction.
The         properties of certain of our telephone subsidiaries are subject to mortgages         securing the debt of such companies. We own substantially all of the central         office buildings, local administrative buildings, warehouses, and storage         facilities used in our telephone operations.
For         further information on the location and type of our properties, see the         descriptions of our operations in Item 1.

Legal                   Proceedings.
In Barbrasue         Beattie and James Sovis, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly         situated, v. CenturyTel, Inc.
,         filed         on October 28, 2002, in the United States District Court for the Eastern         District of Michigan (Case No. 02-10277), the plaintiffs allege that we unjustly         and unreasonably billed customers for inside wire maintenance services, and         seek         unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief under various legal theories         on behalf of a purported class of over two million customers in our telephone         markets. On March 10, 2006, the Court certified a class of plaintiffs and         issued         a ruling that the billing descriptions we used for these services during         an         approximately 18-month period between October 2000 and May 2002 were legally         insufficient. We have appealed this class certification decision, although         we         cannot predict the length of time before this appeal will be adjudicated.         Our         preliminary analysis indicates that we billed less than $9 million for inside         wire maintenance services under the billing descriptions and time periods         specified in the District Court ruling described above. Should other billing         descriptions bedetermined to be inadequate or if claims are allowed for         additional time periods, the amount of our potential exposure could increase         significantly.The Courts order does not specify the award of damages, the         scope and amountsof which, if any, remain subject to additional         fact-finding and resolution of what we believe are valid defenses to         plaintiff  s         claims. Accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount or range of         possible loss at this time. However, considering the one-time nature of any         adverse result, we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of this litigation         will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or         on-goingresults of operations.
40 Table             of Contents In         March         2006, we filed a complaint against AT&T Corp. and AT&T Communications,         Inc. (collectively, AT&T) in the United States District Court for the         District of New Jersey. This lawsuit currently includes 24 other local exchange         company plaintiffs. Our complaint seeks recovery from AT&T of unpaid and         underpaid access charges for calls made using AT&Ts prepaid calling cards         and calls that used Internet Protocol (IP) for a portion of their         transmission. We believe AT&T improperly classified certain of the prepaid         calling card calls as interstate traffic rather than intrastate traffic,         thereby         depriving us of the higher access rates associated with intrastate calls.         We         also believe that AT&T improperly classified the calls that used IP for a         portion of their transmission as local calls, thereby depriving us of access         rates entirely. AT&T has filed a counterclaim against us, asserting that we         improperly billed AT&T terminating intrastate access charges on certain         wireless roaming traffic. At this time, the likely outcome of these cases         cannot         be predicted, nor can a reasonable estimate of the amount of recovery or         payment, if any, be made. Accordingly, we have not recognized any amounts         with         respect to these matters in our consolidated financial statements.
From         time         to time, we are involved in other proceedings incidental to our business,         including administrative hearings of state public utility commissions relating         primarily to rate making, actions relating to employee claims, occasional         grievance hearings before labor regulatory agencies, proceedings by or against         taxing authorities, and miscellaneous third party tort actions. The outcome         of         these other proceedings is not predictable. However, we do not believe that         the         ultimate resolution of these other proceedings, after considering available         insurance coverage, will have a material adverse effect on our financial         position, results of operations or cash flows.

As of February         15,         2007, there were approximately 5,600 stockholders of record of our common         stock.         As of February 28, 2007, the closing stock price of our common stock was         $44.75.
In         February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase         program under which, in February 2006, we repurchased $500 million (or         approximately 14.36 million shares) of our common stock under accelerated         share         repurchase agreements with certain investment banks at an initial average         price         of $34.83. The investment banks completed their repurchases in mid-July 2006         and         in connection therewith we paid an aggregate of approximately $28.4 million         cash         to the investment banks to compensate them for the difference between their         weighted average purchase price during the repurchase period and the initial         average price.
In         August         2006, we began repurchasing our common stock in open-market transactions         under         the remaining $500 million of our $1.0 billion program. The following table         reflects our repurchases of common stock during the fourth quarter of         2006.

Managements                   Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of                   Operations RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW CenturyTel,         Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is an integrated communications company         engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services, including         local and long distance voice, Internet access and broadband services, to         customers in 25 states. We currently derive our revenues from providing (i)         local exchange and long distance voice services, (ii) network access services,         (iii) data services, which includes both high-speed (DSL) and dial-up Internet         services, as well as special access and private line services, (iv) fiber         transport, competitive local exchange and security monitoring services and         (v)         other related services.
Our         results of operations in 2006 were adversely impacted as a result of (i)         lower         Universal Service Fund and intrastate access revenues, (ii) declines in access         lines, (iii) the recognition of stock option expense in accordance with SFAS         123(R) and (iv) expenses associated with expanding our new video and wireless         service offerings. See below for additional information.
On         June         30, 2005, we acquired fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC Telecom         Holdings, Inc. (KMC) for approximately $75.5 million cash.
On         March         1 and August 31, 2006, we announced workforce reductions involving an aggregate         of approximately 400 jobs and, in connection therewith, incurred a net pre-tax         charge of approximately $7.5 million (consisting of a $9.4 million charge         to         operating expenses, net of a $1.9 million favorable revenue impact related         to         such expenses) for severance and related costs. See Note 8 for additional         information.
In         the         second quarter of 2006, we (i) recorded a one-time pre-tax gain of approximately         $117.8 million upon redemption of our investment in the stock of the Rural         Telephone Bank (RTB) and (ii) sold our local exchange operations in Arizona.         See Note 15 for additional information.
Our         net         income for 2006 was $370.0 million, compared to $334.5 million during 2005         and         $337.2 million during 2004. Diluted earnings per share for 2006 was $3.07         compared to $2.49 in 2005 and $2.41 in 2004. The increase in diluted earnings         per share is primarily attributable to lower average shares outstanding in         2006         compared to prior years due to share repurchases that have occurred during         the         past two years and to the gain recorded upon redemption of our investment         in RTB         stock.

Operating         income decreased $17.6 million in 2005 as a $71.9 million increase in operating         revenues was more than offset by an $89.4 million increase in operating         expenses.

Actual events and results         may         differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or         more         of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions         prove         incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited         to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety         of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change;         the         effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry;         our         ability to effectively manage our expansion opportunities, including         successfully financing, consummating and integrating pending acquisitions         and         retaining and hiring key personnel; possible changes in the demand for, or         pricing of, our products and services; our ability to successfully introduce         new         product or service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis; our ability         to collect our receivables from financially troubled communications companies;         our ability to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements on         reasonable terms without work stoppages; the effects of adverse weather;         other         risks referenced from time to time in this report or other of our filings         with         the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the effects of more general factors         such as changes in interest rates, in tax rates, in accounting policies or         practices, in operating, medical or administrative costs, in general market,         labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy.         These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater         detail in Item 1A included herein. You should be aware that new factors may         emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to identify all such         factors nor can we predict the impact of each such factor on the business         or the         extent to which any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ         from         those reflected in any forward-looking statements. You are further cautioned         not         to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak         only as         of the date of this report.

OPERATING         REVENUES Year                   ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars                   in thousands) Voice $ 860,741 892,272 903,025 Network                   access 878,702 959,838 966,011 Data 351,495 318,770 275,777 Fiber                   transport and CLEC 149,088 115,454 74,409 Other 207,704 192,918 188,150 Operating                   revenues $ 2,447,730 2,479,252 2,407,372 As         a         result of increased bundling of our local exchange and long distance service         offerings, beginning in 2006, we have combined the revenues of such offerings         into a category entitled Voice. We have restated prior periods to insure         comparability.
Voice         revenues.
We         derive         voice revenues by providing local exchange telephone services and retail         long         distance services to customers in our service areas. The $31.5 million (3.5%)         decrease in voice revenues in 2006 is primarily due to (i) a $22.3 million         decrease due a 4.8% decline in the number of access lines served and (ii)         a         $26.1 million decline as a result of a decrease in minutes of use in extended         area calling plans in certain areas. Such decreases were partially offset         by (i)         a $12.6 million increase in long distance revenues primarily attributable         to an         increase in the number of long distance lines and increased long distance         minutes of use, both of which were partially offset by a decline in the average         rate we charged our long distance customers and (ii) a $9.9 million increase         due         to providing custom calling features to more customers. The $10.8 million         (1.2%)         decrease in voice revenues in 2005 is primarily due to (i) a $16.5 million         decrease due to a decrease in the average rate we charged our long distance         customers, (ii) a $16.1 million decrease due a 3.3% decline in the average         number of access lines served, and (iii) a $7.5 million decline as a result         of a         decrease in minutes of use in extended area calling plans in certain areas.         Such         decreases were partially offset by (i) a $21.2 million increase in long distance         revenues attributable to a 12.0% increase in the average number of long distance         lines served and a 12.8% increase in minutes of use and (ii) an $8.7 million         increase due to providing custom calling features to more customers.
Excluding         (i) the sale of our Arizona telephone operations in May 2006 and (ii) the         net         impact of removing test lines from our access line counts and adding lines         as a         result of converting and correcting our databases during 2006, access lines         declined 107,000 (4.8%) during 2006 compared to a decline of 99,500 (4.3%)         in         2005. We believe the decline in the number of access lines during the past         few         years is primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone         services by other competitive services. We expect access lines to decline         between 4.5% and 6.0% during 2007.
47 Table             of Contents Network         access revenues.
We         derive our network access revenues primarily from (i) providing services         to         various carriers and customers in connection with the use of our facilities         to         originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice and data         transmissions and (ii) receiving universal support funds which allows us         to         recover a portion of our costs under federal and state cost recovery mechanisms.         Certain of our interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access         charges filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC); the         remainder of such revenues (except for DSL-related revenues) are derived         under         revenue sharing arrangements with other local exchange carriers (LECs)         administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. Intrastate network         access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed with state regulatory         agencies or are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other         LECs.
Network         access revenues decreased $81.1 million (8.5%) in 2006 and decreased $6.2         million (0.6%) in 2005 due to the following factors: 2006 2005 increase increase (decrease) (decrease ) (Dollars                   in thousands) Recovery                   from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop support                   program $ (11,637 ) (13,065 ) Intrastate                   revenues due to decreased minutes of use, decreased access rates                   in                   certain states and recovery from state                   support funds (16,326 ) (13,392 ) Partial                   recovery of operating costs through revenue sharing arrangements                   with                   other telephone companies, interstate access revenues and return                   on rate                   base (16,825 ) 6,819 Rate                   changes in certain jurisdictions (2,875 ) (3,457 ) Prior                   year revenue settlement agreements (31,219 ) 15,947 Other,                   net (2,254 ) 975 $ (81,136 ) (6,173 ) Our         revenues from the Universal Service High Cost Loop Fund decreased approximately         $11.6 million in 2006 and $13.1 million in 2005, primarily due to an increase         in         the nationwide average cost per loop factor used by the FCC to allocate funds         among all recipients. We anticipate our 2007 revenues from the federal Universal         Service High Cost Loop support program will be approximately the same as         2006         levels.
In         2006,         we experienced a reduction in our intrastate revenues of approximately $16.3         million primarily due to a reduction in intrastate minutes (partially due         to the         displacement of minutes by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling         services). The corresponding decrease in 2005 compared to 2004 was $13.4         million. We believe intrastate minutes will continue to decline in 2007,         although the magnitude of such decrease is uncertain.
48 Table             of Contents Prior         year revenue settlement agreements for 2005 included the recognition of         approximately $35.9 million of revenue settlements for prior periods that         did         not recur in 2006. Of the $35.9 million recognized, $24.5 million was reflected         in network access revenues and $11.4 million was reflected in data revenues.
Data         revenues .         We         derive our data revenues primarily by providing Internet access services         (both         DSL and dial-up services) and data transmission services over special circuits         and private lines. Data revenues increased $32.7 million (10.3%) in 2006         and         $43.0 million (15.6%) in 2005. The 2006 increase was substantially due to         a         $54.0 million increase in DSL-related revenues primarily due to growth in         the         number of high-speed Internet customers. Such increase was partially offset         by a         decrease in prior year revenue settlements due to the above-described         recognition of approximately $11.4 million of revenue in the third quarter         of         2005 and a $4.9 million decrease due to a reduced number of dial-up Internet         customers.
The         $43.0         million increase in 2005 was primarily due to (i) a $24.8 million increase         in         Internet revenues due primarily to growth in the number of high-speed Internet         customers, partially offset by a decrease in the number of dial-up customers,         (ii) a $10.8 million increase in special access revenues due to an increase         in         the number of special circuits provided and an increase in the partial recovery         of our increased operating expenses through revenue sharing arrangements         with         other telephone companies, and (iii) an $8.6 million net increase in revenues         related to prior year settlement agreements driven principally by the         above-described non-recurring increase in the third quarter of         2005.
Fiber         transport and CLEC.
Our         fiber         transport and CLEC revenues include revenues from our fiber transport,         competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) and security monitoring businesses.         Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $33.6 million (29.1%) in 2006,         of         which $24.4 million was due to revenues from the fiber assets acquired on         June         30, 2005 from KMC and $8.5 million was attributable to growth in our incumbent         fiber transport business. Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $41.0         million (55.2%) in 2005, of which $27.7 million was due to revenue from the         June         30, 2005 acquisition of fiber assets from KMC and $12.4 million was attributable         to growth in our incumbent fiber transport business.
Other         revenues.
We         derive other revenues primarily by (i) leasing, selling, installing and         maintaining customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring, (ii)         providing billing and collection services for third parties, (iii) participating         in the publication of local directories and (iv) providing new service         offerings, principally consisting of our new video and wireless reseller         services. Other revenues increased $14.8 million (7.7%) during 2006 primarily         due to a $12.1 million increase in revenues of our video and wireless reseller         offerings and $2.5 million increase in directory revenues. Other revenues         increased $4.8 million (2.5%) during 2005 primarily due to a $4.5 million         increase in directory revenues.
49 Table             of Contents OPERATING         EXPENSES Year                   ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars                   in thousands) Cost                   of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and                   amortization) $ 888,414 821,929 755,413 Selling,                   general and administrative 370,272 388,989 397,102 Depreciation                   and amortization 523,506 531,931 500,904 Operating                   expenses $ 1,782,192 1,742,849 1,653,419 Cost         of services and products.
Cost of         services and products increased $66.5 million (8.1%) in 2006 primarily due         to         (i) an $18.9 million increase in expenses incurred by the properties acquired         from KMC; (ii) an $18.3 million increase in costs associated with growth         in our         long distance business; (iii) a $14.3 million increase in expenses associated         with our video and wireless reseller service offerings; (iv) an $11.5 million         increase in Internet operating expenses primarily due to growth in the number         of         high-speed Internet customers; and (v) $8.6 million of severance and related         costs associated with our workforce reduction (see Note 8).
Cost         of         services and products increased $66.5 million (8.8%) in 2005 primarily due         to         (i) a $21.9 million increase in expenses incurred by the properties acquired         from KMC in June 2005; (ii) a $16.4 million increase in expenses associated         with         our Internet operations primarily due to an increase in the number of high-speed         Internet customers; (iii) a $10.6 million increase in costs associated with         growth in our fiber transport business; (iv) a $9.0 million increase in salaries         and benefits; (v) an $8.2 million increase in access expenses; (vi) a $5.3         million increase due to start-up costs associated with our new video and         wireless reseller services; and (vii) a $4.3 million increase in costs         associated with growth in our long distance business. Such increases were         partially offset by (i) a $3.9 million decrease in expenses caused by us         settling certain pole attachment disputes in 2005 for amounts less than those         previously accrued and (ii) a $3.4 million decrease in customer service         expense.
Selling,         general and administrative.
Selling,         general and administrative expenses decreased $18.7 million (4.8%) in 2006         primarily due to an $11.0 million decrease in marketing expenses; a $10.6         million reduction in information technology expenses; an $8.7 million reduction         in bad debt expense; and a $5.8 million decrease in operating taxes. These         decreases were partially offset by a $9.9 million increase in salaries and         benefits and a $5.5 million increase in expenses incurred from the properties         acquired from KMC.
Selling,         general and administrative expenses decreased $8.1 million (2.0%) in 2005         primarily due to (i) a $12.4 million decrease in operating taxes (primarily         due         to an $8.6 million one-time charge in the third quarter of 2004); (ii) an         $11.2         million reduction in bad debt expense, and (iii) a $4.6 million decrease         in         expenses attributable to our Sarbanes-Oxley internal controls compliance         effort.         Such decreases were partially offset by (i) $7.9 million of expenses incurred         by         the properties acquired from KMC; (ii) a $5.9 million increase in customer         service and marketing costs associated with growth in our Internet business         and         (iii) a $2.8 million increase in sales and marketing costs associated with         our         new video and wireless reseller services.
50 Table             of Contents Depreciation         and amortization .         Depreciation and amortization decreased $8.4 million (1.6%) in 2006, primarily         due to a $25.3 million reduction in depreciation expense due to certain assets         becoming fully depreciated. Such decreases were partially offset by (i) a         $16.6         million increase due to higher levels of plant in service and (ii) a $3.1         million increase due to depreciation and amortization of the properties acquired         from KMC.
Depreciation         and amortization increased $31.0 million (6.2%) in 2005. The year 2004 included         a one-time reduction in depreciation expense of $13.2 million to adjust the         balances of certain over-depreciated property, plant and equipment accounts.         The         remaining $17.8 million increase in 2005 is primarily due to (i) a $19.0         million         increase due to higher levels of plant in service, (ii) a $6.1 million increase         associated with amortization of our new billing system and (iii) a $2.8 million         increase due to depreciation and amortization incurred by the properties         acquired from KMC. Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $7.8 million         reduction in depreciation expense due to certain assets becoming fully         depreciated and (ii) the non-recurrence in 2005 of a $3.1 million one-time         increase recorded in 2004 related to the depreciation of fixed assets associated         with our new billing system.
Other.
For         additional information regarding certain matters that have impacted or may         impact our operations, see Regulation and Competition.
INTEREST         EXPENSE Interest         expense decreased $5.8 million (2.9%) in 2006 compared to 2005 as a $10.5         million decrease due primarily to a decrease in average debt outstanding         was         partially offset by a $7.1 million increase due to higher average interest         rates.
Interest         expense decreased $9.3 million (4.4%) in 2005 compared to 2004 as a $16.1         million decrease due primarily to a decrease in average debt outstanding         was         partially offset by a $7.7 million increase due to higher average interest         rates.
OTHER         INCOME (EXPENSE) Other         income (expense) includes the effects of certain items not directly related         to         our core operations, including gains/losses from asset dispositions and         impairments, our share of income from our 49% interest in a cellular         partnership, interest income and allowance for funds used during construction.         Other income (expense) was $121.6 million in 2006, $3.2 million in 2005 and         $4.5         million in 2004. The years 2006, 2005 and 2004 were impacted by certain charges         and credits that are not expected to occur in the future. Included in 2006         were         pre-tax gains of approximately $118.6 million, substantially all of which         related to the redemption of our RTB stock upon dissolution of the RTB, which         were partially offset by pre-tax charges of approximately $11.7 million due         to         the impairment of certain non-operating investments. Included in 2005 was         (i) a         $16.2 million pre-tax charge due to the impairment of a non-operating         investment; (ii) a $4.8 million debt extinguishment expense related to         purchasing and retiring approximately $400 million of our Senior J notes;         (iii)         $3.2 million of non-recurring interest income related to the settlement of         various income tax audits; and (iv) a $3.5 million gain from the sale of         a         non-operating investment. Included in 2004 was a $3.6 million prepayment         expense         paid in connection with the redemption of $100 million aggregate principal         amount of our Series B senior notes in May 2004 and a $2.5 million charge         related to the impairment of a non-operating investment.
51 Table             of Contents INCOME         TAX EXPENSE Our         effective income tax rate was 37.4%, 37.8% and 38.4% in 2006, 2005 and 2004,         respectively. Income tax expense was reduced by approximately $6.4 million         in         2006 due to the resolution of various income tax audit issues. Income tax         expense for 2005 was increased by $19.5 million as a result of increasing         the         valuation allowance related to net state operating loss carryforwards. This         increase was primarily due to changes in state income tax laws and other         factors         which impacted the projections of future taxable income. This tax expense         increase was more than offset by (i) a reduction of state income tax reserves         ($11.6 million, net of federal income tax benefit); (ii) a reduction in our         composite state income tax rate due to more income being apportioned to states         with lower state tax rates ($8.5 million); and (iii) the favorable settlement         of         various federal income tax audits ($1.3 million).
ACCOUNTING         PRONOUNCEMENTS In         June         2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No.         48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which clarifies the         accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements.         FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting         and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected         to be         taken on a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after         December 15, 2006. We do not expect the impact of adopting FIN 48 to have         a         material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results         of         operations.
In         September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement         of         Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157).         SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value         and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required or permitted         under other accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years         beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact         of         adopting SFAS 157.
52 Table             of Contents In         September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement         of         Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined         Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 was         effective for our December 31, 2006 balance sheet and requires us to recognize         the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and postretirement         plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet and to recognize changes         in         that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through adjustments         to         other comprehensive income (loss) and to stockholders equity, reflected in         accumulated other comprehensive loss. As a result of the implementation of         SFAS         158, our non-current assets decreased $64.7 million, our current liabilities         decreased $898,000, our non-current liabilities (excluding deferred income         taxes) increased approximately $99.5 million, our deferred income taxes         decreased approximately $65.4 million and our stockholders equity (reflected in         accumulated other comprehensive loss) decreased approximately $97.9 million.         See         Note 1 for additional information.
In         September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting         Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when         Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB         108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should         be         considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements.         SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance         sheet         approach and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach         results in quantifying an error that is material in light of the relevant         quantitative and qualitative factors. We adopted SAB 108 in the fourth quarter         of 2006. Upon the implementation of SAB 108, we recognized a net $9.7 million         increase to beginning of the year retained earnings for the cumulative effect         of         correcting prior year uncorrected misstatements. See Note 1 for additional         information.
On         January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.         143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143), which addresses         financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with         the         retirement of tangible long-lived assets and requires that the fair value         of a         liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period         in         which it is incurred and be capitalized as part of the book value of the         long-lived asset. Although we generally have no legal obligation to remove         obsolete assets, depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory         authorities for our telephone operations subject to Statement of Financial         Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of         Regulation (SFAS 71), have historically included a component for removal         costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the         adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires us to continue to reflect this         accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though         there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, we did not         adopt         the provisions of SFAS 143 for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71.         For         our telephone operations acquired from Verizon in 2002 (which are not subject         to         SFAS 71) and our other non-regulated operations, we have not accrued a liability         for anticipated removal costs related to tangible long-lived assets through         an         adjustment to our depreciation rates for these assets. For these reasons,         the         adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on our financial         statements.
53 Table             of Contents On         March31, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued         Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), an interpretation of SFAS 143. FIN 47, which was effective for         fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, clarifies that the recognition         and         measurement provisions of SFAS143 apply to asset retirement obligations in         which the timing or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event         that may or may not be within control of the entity. We identified conditional         asset retirement obligations for (i) asbestos removal in buildings, (ii)         removal         of underground storage tanks, (iii) our property located on public and private         rights-of way and (iv) our property that is attached to poles owned by other         utilities and municipalities. Due to a lack of historical experience from         which         to reasonably estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates, we         concluded that an asset retirement obligation associated with our property         located on rights-of-way is indeterminate. We also concluded that our         conditional asset retirement obligations related to the removal of asbestos,         underground storage tanks and our property that is attached to other entities poles was immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations         and         therefore has not been recognized.
CRITICAL         ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our         financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles         that         are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial         statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect         the         reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually         evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to (i) revenue         recognition, (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts, (iii) pension and         postretirement benefits, (iv) long-lived assets and (v) income taxes. Actual         results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We believe these         critical accounting policies discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment         or complexity.
Revenue         recognition.
Certain         of our interstate network access and data revenues are based on tariffed         access         charges filed directly with the FCC; the remainder of such revenues is derived         from revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs administered by the National         Exchange Carrier Association, with the exception of DSL-related revenues         which         were removed from our pooled interstate tariff filing effective July 1, 2006         and         are now recognized as revenues when billed. During 2004, we began generally         recognizing such interstate network access revenues at the authorized rate         of         return, unless the actual achieved or projected rate of return was lower         than         authorized.
The         Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local exchange carriers to file access         tariffs on a streamlined basis and, if certain criteria are met, deems those         tariffs lawful. Tariffs that have been deemed lawful in effect nullify an         interexchange carriers ability to seek refunds should the earnings from the         tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized rate of return         prescribed by the FCC. Certain of our telephone subsidiaries file interstate         tariffs with the FCC using this streamlined filing approach. Since July 2004,         we         have recognized billings from our tariffs as revenue since we believe such         tariffs are deemed lawful. There is no assurance that our future tariff         filings will be deemed lawful. For those billings from tariffs prior to July         2004, we initially recorded as a liability our earnings in excess of the         authorized rate of return, and may thereafter recognize as revenue some or         all         of these amounts at the end of the applicable settlement period or as our         legal         entitlement thereto becomes certain. We recorded approximately $35.9 million         as         revenue in the third quarter of 2005 as the settlement period related to         the         2001/2002 monitoring period lapsed on September 30, 2005. The amount of our         earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return reflected as a liability         on         the balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 for the 2003/2004 monitoring period         aggregated approximately $43 million. The settlement period related to the         2003/2004 monitoring period lapses on September 30, 2007.
54 Table             of Contents Allowance         for doubtful accounts .         In         evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable, we assess a number         of         factors, including a specific customers or carriers ability to meet its         financial obligations to us, the length of time the receivable has been past         due         and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, we record         both         specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce         the related accounts receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect         from customers and carriers. If circumstances change or economic conditions         worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, we         may         need to increase our reserves from the levels reflected in our accompanying         consolidated balance sheet.
Pension         and postretirement benefits.
The         amounts recognized in our financial statements related to pension and         postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis, which utilizes         many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts. A significant assumption         used in determining our pension and postretirement expense is the expected         long-term rate of return on plan assets. For 2006 and 2005, we utilized an         expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25%, which we believe         reflects the expected long-term rates of return in the financial markets.
Another         assumption used in the determination of our pension and postretirement benefit         plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate. Our discount rate at December         31, 2006 ranged from 5.75-5.80% compared to 5.5% at December 31, 2005, which         we         believe is the appropriate rate at which the pension and postretirement benefits         could be effectively settled. Such rates were determined based on a discounted         cash flow analysis of our expected cash outflows of our benefit plans. A         25         basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase annual combined         pension and postretirement expense approximately $3.0 million.
Intangible         and long-lived assets.
We are         subject to testing for impairment of long-lived assets under two accounting         standards, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and         Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), and Statement of Financial Accounting         Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived         Assets (SFAS 144).
SFAS         142         requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for         impairment at least annually and requires write-downs only in periods in         which         the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Under SFAS 142,         impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting         unit to its carrying value (including goodwill). Estimates of the fair value         of         the reporting unit are based on valuation models using techniques such as         multiples of earnings (before interest, taxes and depreciation and         amortization). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying         value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of         goodwill is compared to its carrying value. If the implied fair value of         goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to         its         implied fair value. We completed the required annual test of goodwill impairment         (as of September 30, 2006) under SFAS 142 and determined our goodwill was         not         impaired as of such date.
55 Table             of Contents Under         SFAS 144, the carrying value of long-lived assets other than goodwill is         reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such         carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of         the         carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to         be         generated by the assets. If the undiscounted net cash flows are less than         the         carrying value, an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the         carrying value of a long-lived asset over its fair value.
Income         taxes.
We         estimate our current and deferred income taxes based on our assessment of         the         future tax consequences of transactions that have been reflected in our         financial statements or applicable tax returns. Actual income taxes paid         could         vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the         resolution of audits by federal and state taxing authorities. We maintain         income         tax contingency reserves for potential assessments from the various taxing         authorities. These reserves are estimated based on our judgment of the probable         outcome of the tax contingencies and are adjusted periodically based on changing         facts and circumstances. Changes to the tax contingency reserves could         materially affect operating results in the period of change.
For         additional information on our critical accounting policies, see Accounting         Pronouncements and Regulation and Competition - Other Matters below, and the         footnotes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere         herein.
INFLATION Historically,         we have mitigated the effects of increased costs by recovering over time         certain         costs applicable to our regulated telephone operations through the rate-making         process. However, LECs operating over 65% of our total access lines are now         governed by state alternative regulation plans, some of which restrict or         delay         our ability to recover increased costs. Additional future regulatory changes         may         further alter our ability to recover increased costs in our regulated         operations. For the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002, which are         regulated under price-cap regulation for interstate purposes, price changes         are         limited to the rate of inflation, minus a productivity offset. As operating         expenses in our nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of         inflation, we, to the extent permitted by competition, attempt to recover         the         costs by increasing prices for our services and equipment.
56 Table             of Contents MARKET         RISK We         are         exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long-term debt         obligations. We have estimated our market risk using sensitivity analysis.         Market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed-rate         debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates. Fair         value of long-term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted cash         flow analysis, using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared         to         terms and rates currently available in the long-term financing markets. The         results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented         below, although the actual results may differ from these estimates.
At         December 31, 2006, the fair value of our long-term debt was estimated to         be $2.5         billion based on the overall weighted average rate of our long-term debt         of 6.9%         and an overall weighted maturity of 8 years compared to terms and rates         available on such date in long-term financing markets. Market risk is estimated         as the potential decrease in fair value of our long-term debt resulting from         a         hypothetical increase of 69 basis points in interest rates (ten percent of         our         overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest rates         would result in approximately an $89.6 million decrease in the fair value         of our         long-term debt. As of December 31, 2006, after giving effect to interest         rate         swaps currently in place, approximately 80% of our long-term and short-term         debt         obligations were fixed rate.
We         seek         to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort         to         limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates.         From time to time, we use derivative instruments to (i) lock-in or swap our         exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates         or (ii)         to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates.         We         have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval,         reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not hold         or         issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.         We         periodically review our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implement         strategies to manage the exposure.
At         December 31, 2006, we had outstanding four fair value interest rate hedges         associated with the full $500 million aggregate principal amount of our Series         L         senior notes, due 2012, that pay interest at a fixed rate of 7.875%. These         hedges are fixed to variable interest rate swaps that effectively convert our         fixed rate interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations         to         pay variable rates that range from the six-month London InterBank Offered         Rate         (LIBOR) plus 3.229% to the six-month LIBOR plus 3.67%, with settlement and         rate reset dates occurring each six months through the expiration of the         hedges         in August 2012. During 2006, we realized an average interest rate under these         hedges of 9.03%. Interest expense was increased by $5.8 million during 2006         as a         result of these hedges. The aggregate fair market value of these hedges was         $20.6 million at December 31, 2006 and is reflected both as a liability and         as a         decrease in our underlying long-term debt on the December 31, 2006 balance         sheet. With respect to each of these hedges, market risk is estimated as         the         potential change in the fair value of the hedge resulting from a hypothetical         10% increase in the forward rates used to determine the fair value. A         hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates would result in a $13.3 million         decrease in the fair value of these hedges at December 31, 2006, and would         also         increase our interest expense.
57 Table             of Contents Certain         shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation         of fair value of financial instruments. Actual values may differ from those         presented if market conditions vary from assumptions used in the fair value         calculations. The analysis above incorporates only those risk exposures that         existed as of December 31, 2006.
LIQUIDITY         AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Excluding         cash used for acquisitions, we rely on cash provided by operations to provide         for our cash needs. Our operations have historically provided a stable source         of         cash flow which has helped us continue our long-term program of capital         improvements.
Operating         activities.
Net cash         provided by operating activities was $840.7 million, $964.7 million and $955.8         million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our accompanying consolidated         statements of cash flows identify major differences between net income and         net         cash provided by operating activities for each of those years. As relief         from         the effects of Hurricane Katrina, certain of our affected subsidiaries were         granted a deferral from making their remaining 2005 estimated federal income         and         excise tax payments until 2006. During 2006, we made payments of approximately         $75 million to satisfy our remaining 2005 estimated payments. For additional         information relating to our operations, see Results of Operations above.
Investing         activities.
Net cash         used in investing activities was $193.7 million, $481.4 million and $413.3         million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We received approximately $122.8         million cash from the redemption of our RTB stock upon dissolution of the         RTB         during 2006. See Note 15 for additional information. Cash used for acquisitions         was $75.5 million in 2005 (due to the acquisition of fiber assets in 16         metropolitan markets from KMC). Capital expenditures during 2006, 2005 and         2004         were $314.1 million, $414.9 million and $385.3 million, respectively.
Financing         activities.
Net cash         used in financing activities was $780.2 million in 2006, $491.7 million in         2005         and $578.5 million in 2004. Payments of debt were $82.0 million in 2006,         $693.3         million in 2005 and $179.4 million in 2004. In accordance with previously         announced stock repurchase programs, we repurchased 21.4 million shares (for         $802.2 million), 16.4 million shares (for $551.8 million), and 13.4 million         shares (for $401.0 million) in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006         repurchases include 14.36 million shares repurchased (for an aggregate final         price of approximately $528.4 million) under accelerated share repurchase         agreements with investment banks (see Note 9 for additional information).         We         initially funded purchases under these agreements principally through borrowings         under our $750 million credit facility and cash on hand and subsequently         refinanced the credit facility borrowings through the issuance of short-term         commercial paper. The 2005 repurchases include 12.9 million shares repurchased         (for an aggregate final price of $437.5 million) under accelerated share         repurchase agreements (see below and Note 9 to the accompanying financial         statements for additional information).
58 Table             of Contents In         February 2005, we remarketed substantially all of our $500 million of         outstanding Series J senior notes due 2007 at an interest rate of 4.628%.         We         received no proceeds in connection with the remarketing as all proceeds were         held in trust to secure the obligation of our equity unit holders to purchase         common stock from us on May 16, 2005. In connection with the remarketing,         we         purchased and retired approximately $400 million of the notes, resulting         in         approximately $100 million remaining outstanding. We incurred a pre-tax charge         of approximately $6 million in the first quarter of 2005 related to purchasing         and retiring the notes. We purchased such notes with proceeds from the February         2005 issuance of $350 million of 5% senior notes, Series M, due 2015 and         cash on         hand.
On         May         16, 2005, upon settlement of 15.9 million of our outstanding equity units,         we         received proceeds of approximately $398.2 million and issued approximately         12.9         million common shares. In late May 2005, we entered into accelerated share         repurchase agreements with investment banks whereby we repurchased and retired         12.9 million shares of common stock for an aggregate final price of $437.5         million, the proceeds of which came from the settlement of the equity units         mentioned above and cash on hand.
Other.
For         2007, we have budgeted $325 million for capital expenditures. In 2006, we         concluded that our prior extensive capital investment in our wireline network         permitted us to reduce network capital spending to maintenance levels. We         expect         this to be the case for the foreseeable future. Our 2007 capital expenditure         budget also includes amounts for expanding our new service offerings and         expanding our data networks.

(2)         Includes $165 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures,         Series K, due 2032, which can be put to us at various dates beginning in         2010.
(3)         This         amount represents an estimated purchase price based on MRCCs net indebtedness         as of September 30, 2006 (see below for additional information).
In         December 2006, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Madison River         Communications Corp. (MRCC) and its owner, Madison River Telephone Company,         LLC. Under this agreement, we agreed to purchase all of the capital stock         of         MRCC in exchange for $830 million less MRCCs net indebtedness on the         transactions closing date (which was approximately $494 million at September         30, 2006), subject to certain closing adjustments. We expect to initially         fund         this acquisition using borrowings under our existing credit facility and         are         currently reviewing our longer term options for repaying or refinancing these         borrowings.
We         continually evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional communications         operations and expect to continue our long-term strategy of pursuing the         acquisition of attractively-priced communications properties in exchange         for         cash, securities or both. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions         or         negotiations regarding additional acquisitions. We generally do not announce         our         acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or         definitive agreement. We may require additional financing in connection with         any         such acquisitions, the consummation of which could have a material impact         on our         financial condition or operations. Approximately 4.1 million shares of our         common stock and 200,000 shares of our preferred stock remain available for         future issuance in connection with acquisitions under our acquisition shelf         registration statement. We also have access to debt and equity capital         markets.
60 Table             of Contents In         December 2006, we secured a new five-year, $750 million revolving credit         facility. The credit facility contains financial covenants that require us         to         meet a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) not exceeding         4         to 1 and a minimum interest coverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of         at         least 1.5 to 1. The interest rate on revolving loans under the facility is         based         on our choice of several prevailing commercial lending rates plus an additional         margin that varies depending on our credit ratings and aggregate borrowings         under the facility. We must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unutilized         portion of the facility, the amount of which varies based on our credit ratings.         Up to $150 million of the credit facility can be used for letters of credit,         which reduces the amount available for other extensions of credit. Available         borrowings under our credit facility are also effectively reduced by any         outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. Our commercial         paper         program borrowings in turn are effectively limited to the total amount available         under our credit facility. As of December 31, 2006, we had no amounts         outstanding under our new credit facility but did have $23 million outstanding         under our commercial paper program.
Moodys         Investors Service (Moodys) rates our long-term debt Baa2 (with a stable         outlook) and Standard & Poors (S&P) rates our long-term debt BBB         (with a negative outlook). Our commercial paper program is rated P2 by Moodys         and A3 by S&P. Any downgrade in our credit ratings will increase our         borrowing costs and commitment fees under our $750 million revolving credit         facility. Downgrades could also restrict our access to the capital markets,         accelerate the conversion rights of holders of our outstanding convertible         securities, increase our borrowing costs under new or replacement debt         financings, or otherwise adversely affect the terms of future borrowings         by,         among other things, increasing the scope of our debt covenants and decreasing         our financial or operating flexibility.
The         following table reflects our debt to total capitalization percentage and         ratio         of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends as of and for         the         years ended December 31: 2006 2005 2004 Debt                   to total capitalization 44.8 % 42.3 46.9 Ratio                   of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends* 3.97 3.60 3.57 *         For         purposes of the chart above, earnings consist of income before income taxes         and fixed charges, and fixed charges include our interest expense, including         amortized debt issuance costs, and our preferred stock dividend         costs.
61 Table             of Contents REGULATION         AND COMPETITION The         communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory,         legislative, competitive and technological changes. These changes may have         a         significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications         companies.
Events         affecting the communications industry.
Wireless         telephone services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition         with LEC services, especially since wireless carriers have begun to compete         effectively on the basis of price with more traditional telephone services.         As a         result, some customers have chosen to completely forego use of traditional         wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service for voice         services. We anticipate this trend will continue, particularly if wireless         service providers continue to expand their coverage areas, reduce their rates,         improve the quality of their services, and offer enhanced new services.
In         1996,         the United States Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the 1996         Act), which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their         facilities to the LECs network and to take various other steps that are         designed to promote competition. Under the 1996 Acts rural telephone company         exemption, approximately 50% of our telephone access lines are exempt from         certain of these interconnection requirements unless and until the appropriate         state regulatory commission overrides the exemption upon receipt from a         competitor of a bona fide request meeting certain criteria.
Prior         to         and since the enactment of the 1996 Act, the FCC and a number of state         legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange         competition. Coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition         has been the reduction of regulatory oversight of LECs. These cumulative         changes, coupled with various technological developments, have led to the         continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with         LECs services.
Federal         USF programs have recently undergone substantial changes, and are expected         to         experience more changes in the coming years. As mandated by the 1996 Act,         in May         2001 the FCC modified its existing universal service support mechanism for         rural         telephone companies by adopting an interim mechanism for a five-year period         based on embedded, or historical, costs that provides relatively predictable         levels of support to many LECs, including substantially all of our LECs.         In May         2006, the FCC extended this interim mechanism until such time that new high-cost         support rules are adopted for rural telephone companies. Wireless and other         competitive service providers continue to seek eligible telecommunications         carrier status in order to receive USF support, which, coupled with changes         in         usage of telecommunications services, have placed stress on the funding         mechanism of the USF, which is subject to annual caps on disbursements. These         developments have placed additional financial pressure on the amount of money         that is necessary to provide support to all eligible service providers,         including support payments we receive from the USF High Cost Loop support         program. Increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used to         allocate funds among all USF recipients caused our revenues from the USF         High         Cost Loop support program to decrease in 2005 and 2006 from the amounts received         in the prior year. However, based on recent FCC filings, we anticipate our         2007         revenues from the USF High Cost Loop support program will approximate our         2006         levels.
62 Table             of Contents During         2004, a joint board named by the FCC released a notice requesting comments         on         the FCCs current rules for the provision of high-cost support for rural         companies, including comments on whether eligibility requirements should         be         amended in a manner that would adversely affect larger rural LECs such as         us. In         addition, the FCC has taken various other steps in anticipation of restructuring         universal service support mechanisms, which in the aggregate could substantially         impact these support payments. In August 2005, the joint board sought comments         on four separate proposals to modify the distribution of High Cost Loop support         funds. In August 2006, the joint board sought comment on the viability of         using         competitive bidding to determine the amount of high-cost funding for all         eligible carriers. We anticipate that the joint board will make reform         suggestions to the FCC by mid-2007, at which time the FCC would be required         to         seek comments. Due to the pending nature of these proposals, we cannot estimate         the impact that such proposals would have on our operations.
Recent         technological developments have led to the development of new services that         compete with traditional LEC services. Technological improvements have enabled         cable television companies to provide traditional circuit-switched telephone         service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have         aggressively pursued this opportunity. Recently several large electric utilities         have announced plans to offer communications services that compete with LECs.         Recent improvements in the quality of "Voice-over-Internet Protocol" ("VoIP")         service have led several cable, Internet, data and other communications         companies, as well as start-up companies, to substantially increase their         offerings of VoIP service to business and residential customers. VoIP providers         frequently use existing broadband networks to deliver flat-rate, all distance         calling plans that may offer features that cannot readily be provided by         traditional LECs and may be priced below those currently charged for traditional         local and long distance telephone services. Beginning in late 2003, the FCC         initiated rulemaking proceedings to address the regulation of VoIP, and has         adopted orders establishing some initial broad regulatory guidelines. There         can         be no assurance that future rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ILECs,         or         that VoIP providers will not successfully compete for our         customers.
In         2003,         the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation proceeding with the ultimate         goal of creating a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications         industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, carrying         or         delivering telecommunications traffic. The FCC has received intercarrier         compensation proposals from several industry groups, and industry negotiations         are continuing with the goal of developing a consensus plan that addresses         the         concerns of carriers from all industry segments. Until the FCCs proceeding         concludes and the changes, if any, to the existing rules are established,         we         cannot estimate the impact this proceeding will have on our results of         operations.
63 Table             of Contents Many         cable, entertainment, technology or other communication companies that         previously offered a limited range of services are now, like us, offering         diversified bundles of services. As such, a growing number of companies are         competing to serve the communications needs of the same customer base. Several         of these companies started offering full service bundles before us, which         could         give them an advantage in building customer loyalty.
Recent         events affecting us.
During         the last few years, all of the states in which we provide telephone services         have taken legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition         into         the LEC business. The number of companies which have requested authorization         to         provide local exchange service in our service areas has increased in recent         years, especially in the markets acquired from Verizon in 2002 and 2000,         and it         is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the         future.
State         alternative regulation plans recently adopted by certain of our LECs have         also         affected revenue growth recently. These alternative regulation plans now         govern         over 65% of our access lines.
Certain         long distance carriers continue to request that certain of our LECs reduce         their         intrastate access tariffed rates. In addition, we have recently experienced         reductions in intrastate traffic, partially due to the displacement of minutes         by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling services. In 2006         we         incurred a reduction in our intrastate revenues of approximately $16.3 million         compared to 2005 primarily due to these factors. The corresponding decrease         in         2005 compared to 2004 was $13.4 million. We believe this trend of decreased         intrastate minutes will continue in 2007, although the magnitude of such         decrease is uncertain.
While         we         expect our operating revenues in 2007 to continue to experience downward         pressure primarily due to continued access line losses and reduced network         access revenues, we expect such declines to be partially offset by increased         demand for our fiber transport, high-speed Internet and other nonregulated         product offerings (including our new video and wireless         initiatives).
For         a         more complete description of regulation and competition impacting our operations         and various attendant risks, please see Items 1 and 1A of this annual         report.
Other         matters.
Our         regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from Verizon         in 2002) are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting         Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71). Actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the         recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose         a         liability on a regulated enterprise. Such regulatory assets and liabilities         are         required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the balance sheet         of an         entity subject to SFAS 71. We are monitoring the ongoing applicability of         SFAS         71 to our regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory,         competitive and legislative environments, and it is possible that changes         in         regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services         or products could result in our telephone operations no longer being subject         to         SFAS 71 in the near future.
64 Table             of Contents Statement         of Financial Accounting Standards No. 101, Regulated Enterprises - Accounting         for the Discontinuance of Application of FASB Statement No. 71 (SFAS 101),         specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the criteria         for application of SFAS 71. SFAS 101 requires the elimination of the effects         of         any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities         in         accordance with SFAS 71 but would not have been recognized as assets and         liabilities by nonregulated enterprises. Depreciation rates of certain assets         established by regulatory authorities for our telephone operations subject         to         SFAS 71 have historically included a component for removal costs in excess         of         the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS         143,         SFAS 71 requires us to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for         removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal         obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, we did not adopt the provisions         of         SFAS 143 for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71. SFAS 101 further         provides that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are to         be         adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall         be         judged in the same manner as for nonregulated enterprises.
Our         consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 included regulatory         liabilities of approximately $186.4 million related to estimated removal         costs         embedded in accumulated depreciation (as described above). Net deferred income         tax assets related to the regulatory assets and liabilities quantified above         were $71.3 million.
When         and         if our regulated operations no longer qualify for the application of SFAS         71, we         currently do not expect to record any impairment charge related to the carrying         value of the property, plant and equipment of our regulated telephone         operations. Additionally, upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, we would be         required to revise the lives of our property, plant and equipment to reflect         the         estimated useful lives of the assets. We currently do not expect such revisions         in asset lives will have a material impact on our results of operations.         Upon         the discontinuance of SFAS 71, we also would be required to eliminate certain         intercompany transactions with regulated affiliates that currently are not         eliminated under the application of SFAS 71. For the year ended December         31,         2006, approximately $120 million of revenues (and related costs) would have         been         eliminated had we not been subject to the provisions of SFAS 71. Such         elimination would have had no impact on total operating income. For regulatory         purposes, the accounting and reporting of our telephone subsidiaries will         not be         affected by the discontinued application of SFAS 71.
65 Table             of Contents We         have         certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the         protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2006 have not         been         material, and we currently do not believe that such costs will become         material.

Financial                   Statements and Supplementary                   Data Report         of Management The         Shareholders CenturyTel,         Inc.: Management         has prepared and is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of our         consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements         have         been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted         in the         United States of America and necessarily include amounts determined using         our         best judgments and estimates.
Our         consolidated financial statements have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent         registered public accounting firm, who have expressed their opinion with         respect         to the fairness of the consolidated financial statements. Their audit was         conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting         Oversight Board (United States).
Management         is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls         over         financial reporting, a process designed to provide reasonable assurance         regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of         financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted         accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of         management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial         officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal         control         over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal         Control- Integrated Framework issued         by         the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).         Based on our evaluation under the framework of COSO , management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was         effective as of December 31, 2006. Managements assessment of the effectiveness         of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006         has         been audited by KPMG LLP, as stated in their report which is included herein.
Because         of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may         not         prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of         effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may         become         inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance         with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The         Audit         Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of independent directors         who are         not officers or employees. The Committee meets periodically with the external         auditors, internal auditors and management. The Committee considers the         independence of the external auditors and the audit scope and discusses internal         control, financial and reporting matters. Both the external and internal         auditors have free access to the Committee.

In connection with our audits of the         consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement         schedule as listed in Item 15a(2). These consolidated financial statements         and         financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management.         Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial         statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We         conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company         Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that         we plan         and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial         statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,         on a         test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial         statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used         and         significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall         financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a         reasonable basis for our opinion.
In         our         opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present         fairly,         in all material respects, the financial position of CenturyTel, Inc. and         subsidiaries as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their         operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period         ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting         principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,         when         considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken         as a         whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth         therein.
As         discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January         1, 2006, the Company changed its method of accounting for share-based payments.         In addition, as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,         the Company changed its method of accounting for pension and postretirement         benefits as of December 31, 2006.
We         also         have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting         Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Companys internal         control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria         established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued         by         the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission         (COSO ) ,         and our         report dated March 1, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements         assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial         reportin g.
/s/         KPMG         LLP Shreveport,         Louisiana March         1,         2007 68 Table             of Contents Report         of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The         Board         of Directors and Stockholders CenturyTel,         Inc.: We         have         audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Report         of Management, that         CenturyTel, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting         as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued         by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission         (COSO) .
The         Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control         over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal         control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion         on         managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys         internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We         conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company         Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that         we plan         and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective         internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material         respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control         over         financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating         the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing         such         other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe         that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A         companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to         provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting         and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance         with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over         financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain         to         the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly         reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)         provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary         to         permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted         accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company         are         being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors         of         the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or         timely         detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys         assets that could have a material effect on the financial         statements.
Because         of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may         not         prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of         effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may         become         inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance         with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
69 Table             of Contents In         our         opinion, managements assessment that CenturyTel, Inc. maintained effective         internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly         stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued         by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission         (COSO) .
Also,         in         our opinion, CenturyTel, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective         internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based         on         criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued         by         the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission         (COSO).
We         also         have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting         Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of         CenturyTel, Inc. and subsidiaries and related financial statement schedule         as         listed in Items 15(a)(1) and 15(a)(2), respectively, and our report dated         March         1,2007 expressed         an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and related         financial statement schedule. Such report includes an explanatory paragraph         regarding the Companys change in the method of accounting for share-based         payments and pension and postretirement benefits in 2006.

Notes         to         Consolidated Financial Statements December         31, 2006 (1) SUMMARY                   OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles         of consolidation - Our         consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CenturyTel, Inc.         and         its majority-owned subsidiaries.
Regulatory         accounting - Our         regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from Verizon         in 2002) are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting         Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71). Actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the         recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose         a         liability on a regulated enterprise. Such regulatory assets and liabilities         are         required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the balance sheet         of an         entity subject to SFAS 71. We are monitoring the ongoing applicability of         SFAS         71 to our regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory,         competitive and legislative environments, and it is possible that changes         in         regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services         or products could result in our telephone operations no longer being subject         to         SFAS 71 in the near future. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December         31,         2006 included regulatory liabilities of approximately $186.4 million related         to         estimated removal costs embedded in accumulated depreciation (as required         to be         recorded by regulators). Net deferred income tax assets related to the         regulatory assets and liabilities quantified above were $71.3         million.
Estimates -         The         preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted         accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions         that         affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of         contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements         and         the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.         Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Revenue         recognition -         Revenues are generally recognized when services are provided or when products         are delivered to customers. Revenue that is billed in advance includes monthly         recurring network access services, special access services and monthly recurring         local line charges. The unearned portion of this revenue is initially deferred         as a component of advanced billings and customer deposits on our balance         sheet         and recognized as revenue over the period that the services are provided.         Revenue that is billed in arrears includes nonrecurring network access services,         nonrecurring local services and long distance services. The earned but unbilled         portion of this revenue is recognized as revenue in the period that the services         are provided. Revenues from installation activities (along with the related         costs) are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the customer         relationship.
76 Table             of Contents Certain         of our telephone subsidiaries revenues are based on tariffed access charges         filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission; the remainder         of our         telephone subsidiaries participate in revenue sharing arrangements with other         telephone companies for interstate revenue (except for broadband related         revenues) and for certain intrastate revenue. Such sharing arrangements are         funded by toll revenue and/or access charges within state jurisdictions and         by         access charges in the interstate market. Revenues earned through the various         sharing arrangements are initially recorded based on our estimates.
Allowance         for doubtful accounts .         In         evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable, we assess a number         of         factors, including a specific customers or carriers ability to meet its         financial obligations to us, the length of time the receivable has been past         due         and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, we record         both         specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce         the stated amount of applicable accounts receivable to the amount we ultimately         expect to collect.
Property,         plant and equipment -         Telephone plant is stated at original cost. Normal retirements of telephone         plant are charged against accumulated depreciation, along with the costs         of         removal, less salvage, with no gain or loss recognized. Renewals and betterments         of plant and equipment are capitalized while repairs, as well as renewals         of         minor items, are charged to operating expense. Depreciation of telephone         plant         is provided on the straight line method using class or overall group rates         acceptable to regulatory authorities; such average rates range from 2% to         20%.
Non-telephone         property is stated at cost and, when sold or retired, a gain or loss is         recognized. Depreciation of such property is provided on the straight line         method over estimated service lives ranging from two to 35 years.
Intangible         assets -         Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other         Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), requires goodwill recorded in a business         combination to be reviewed for impairment and to be written down only in         periods         in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. We test         impairment of goodwill at least annually by comparing the fair value of the         reporting unit to its carrying value (including goodwill). We base our estimates         of the fair value of the reporting unit on valuation models using criterion         such         as multiples of earnings.
Long-lived         assets -         Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the         Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144), addresses financial         accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets         (exclusive of goodwill) and also broadens the reporting of discontinued         operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can         be         distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from         the         ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction.
77 Table             of Contents Affiliated         transactions -         Certain of our service subsidiaries provide installation and maintenance         services, materials and supplies, and managerial, operational, technical,         accounting and administrative services to other subsidiaries. In addition,         CenturyTel provides and bills management services to subsidiaries and in         certain         instances makes interest bearing advances to finance construction of plant         and         purchases of equipment. These transactions are recorded by our telephone         subsidiaries at their cost to the extent permitted by regulatory authorities.         Intercompany profit on transactions with regulated affiliates is limited         to a         reasonable return on investment and has not been eliminated in connection         with         consolidating the results of operations of CenturyTel and its subsidiaries.         Intercompany profit on transactions with affiliates not subject to SFAS 71         has         been eliminated.
Income         taxes - We         file a consolidated federal income tax return with our eligible subsidiaries.         We         use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which         deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the future tax         consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement         carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Postretirement         and pension plans - We         adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158) as of December 31, 2006. SFAS 158 requires us to recognize the         overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and postretirement         plans         as an asset or a liability on our balance sheet, with an adjustment to         stockholders equity (reflected as an increase or decrease in accumulated other         comprehensive income or loss). The incremental effect of applying SFAS 158         on         individual line items of our balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 were as         follows: Before                   Application of SFAS                   158 Adjustments After                   Application of SFAS                   158 (Dollars                   in thousands) Other                   assets $ 675,215 (64,738 ) 610,477 Total                   assets $ 7,505,745 (64,738 ) 7,441,007 Accrued                   expenses and other current liabilities $ 259,487 (898 ) 258,589 Deferred                   credits and other liabilities (excluding deferred income                   taxes) $ 447,066 99,512 546,578 Deferred                   income taxes $ 738,508 (65,447 ) 673,061 Total                   liabilities $ 4,216,889 33,167 4,250,056 Accumulated                   other comprehensive loss, net of tax $ (7,037 ) (97,905 ) (104,942 ) Total                   stockholders equity $ 3,288,856 (97,905 ) 3,190,951 Cumulative         effect adjustment - In         September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting         Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effect of Prior Year Misstatements when         Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Results (SAB 108). SAB         108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should         be         considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements.         SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance         sheet         approach and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach         results in quantifying an error that is material in light of the relevant         quantitative and qualitative factors.
78 Table             of Contents We         identified two misstatements that previously were deemed immaterial using         the         income statement approach that are now deemed material upon application of         the         balance sheet approach. Such misstatements relate to (i) the failure to         capitalize interest in connection with the development of our billing system,         which began in the late 1990s; and (ii) the failure to defer the revenues and         costs associated with installation activities related to our service offerings.         Using the guidance of SAB 108, we have recorded a net cumulative effect         adjustment to retained earnings (as of January 1, 2006), which increased         retained earnings approximately $9.7 million (presented on an after-tax basis).         Of the $9.7 million net increase to retained earnings, approximately $14.0         million related to the capitalized interest adjustment, which was partially         offset by a reduction to retained earnings of approximately $4.3 million         related         to the installation activities adjustment. We have adjusted our results of         operations for the first, second and third quarters of 2006 to reflect the         ongoing application of the above. Such adjustments were immaterial to each         quarter.
Stock-based         compensation - Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of         Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share-Based         Payment", which requires us to measureour cost of awarding employees with         equity instruments basedupon the fair value of the awardon the grant         date. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock compensation plans         using         the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board         Opinion No. 25. See Note 14 for additional information.
Derivative         financial instruments - We         account for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with         Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative         Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), as amended. SFAS 133, as         amended, requires that all derivative instruments, such as interest rate         swaps,         be recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless         of the purpose or intent of holding them. On the date a derivative contract         is         entered into, we designate the derivative as either a fair value or cash         flow         hedge. A hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of         an         unrecognized firm commitment is a fair value hedge. A hedge of a forecasted         transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related         to a         recognized asset or liability is a cash flow hedge. We also formally assess,         both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives         that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting         changes         in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. If we determine that a derivative         is not, or is no longer, highly effective as a hedge, we would discontinue         hedge         accounting prospectively. We recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet         at         their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments         are either recognized in income or stockholders equity (as a component of         accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), depending on whether the         derivative is being used to hedge changes in the fair value or cash flows.         We do         not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative         purposes. Management periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate         fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure.
Earnings         per share - Basic         earnings per share amounts are determined on the basis of the weighted average         number of common shares outstanding during the applicable accounting period.         Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all potential dilutive common         shares         that were outstanding during the period. See Note 13 for additional         information.
79 Table             of Contents Cash         equivalents - We         consider short-term investments with a maturity at date of purchase of three         months or less to be cash equivalents.
(2) ACQUISITION On         June         30, 2005, we acquired fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC Telecom         Holdings, Inc. (KMC) for approximately $75.5 million. The assets acquired and         liabilities assumed have been reflected in our consolidated balance sheet         based         on a purchase price allocation determined by independent third parties. The         vast         majority of the purchase price was allocated to property, plant and equipment.         See Note 3 for information concerning amounts allocated to certain intangible         assets as a result of the KMC acquisition. The results of operations of the         KMC         properties are included in our results of operations from and after the         acquisition date.
(3) GOODWILL                   AND OTHER ASSETS Goodwill         and other assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were composed of the         following: December                   31, 2006 2005 (Dollars                   in thousands) Goodwill $ 3,431,136 3,432,649 Billing                   system development costs, less accumulated amortization of $26,752                   and                   $14,899 204,597 193,579 Cash                   surrender value of life insurance contracts 94,788 94,801 Deferred                   costs associated with installation activities 73,256 - Pension                   asset 16,187 73,360 Intangible                   assets not subject to amortization 36,690 36,690 Marketable                   securities 32,235 29,195 Deferred                   interest rate hedge contracts 23,134 25,624 Investment                   in debt security 22,209 21,611 Intangible                   assets subject to amortization Customer                   base, less accumulated amortization of $7,022 and $5,349 18,072 19,745 Contract                   rights, less accumulated amortization of $3,256 and $1,861 930 2,326 Other 88,379 105,625 $ 4,041,613 4,035,205 Our         goodwill was derived from numerous previous acquisitions whereby the purchase         price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. We test for goodwill         impairment annually under SFAS 142 and, based on our analysis performed as         of         September 30, 2006, determined our goodwill was not impaired.
80 Table             of Contents We         accounted for the costs to develop an integrated billing and customer care         system in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs         of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Aggregate         capitalized costs (before accumulated amortization) totaled $231.3 million         and         are being amortized over a twenty-year period. We adjusted the aggregate         capitalized costs as of January 1, 2006 to include previously unrecognized         capitalized interest. See Note 1 - Cumulative effect adjustment for additional         information.
In         connection with the application of SAB 108 (see Note 1), we established deferred         revenues and costs associated with installation activities effective as of         January 1, 2006.
In         the         third quarter of 2004, we entered into a three-year agreement with EchoStar         Communications Corporation (EchoStar) to provide co-branded satellite         television services to our customers. As part of the transaction, we invested         $25 million in an EchoStar convertible subordinated debt security, which         had a         fair value at date of issuance of approximately $20.8 million and matures         in         2011. The remaining $4.2 million paid was established as an intangible asset         attributable to our contractual right to provide video service and is being         amortized over a three-year period.
In         connection with the acquisitions of properties from Verizon Communications,         Inc.         (Verizon) in 2002, we assigned $35.3 million of the purchase price as an         intangible asset associated with franchise costs (which includes amounts         necessary to maintain eligibility to provide telecommunications services         in its         licensed service areas). In 2005, we assigned $1.4 million of the purchase         price         of our acquisition of KMC fiber assets as an intangible asset. Such assets         have         an indefinite life and therefore are not subject to amortization currently.
We         assigned $22.7 million of the purchase price to a customer base intangible         asset         in connection with the acquisitions of Verizon properties in 2002. In 2005,         $2.4         million of the purchase price of our acquisition of KMC fiber assets was         assigned to a customer base intangible asset. Such assets are being amortized         over 15 years. In addition, as mentioned above, in 2004 we established an         intangible asset related to the contractual rights to provide video service.         Total amortization expense for these customer base and contractual right         intangible assets for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $3.1 million, $3.0 million         and         $2.0 million, respectively, and is expected to be $2.6 million in 2007 and         $1.7         million annually thereafter through 2010.

Certain         of our loan agreements contain various restrictions, among which are limitations         regarding issuance of additional debt, payment of cash dividends, reacquisition         of capital stock and other matters. In addition, the transfer of funds from         certain consolidated subsidiaries to CenturyTel is restricted by various         loan         agreements. Subsidiaries which have loans from government agencies and         cooperative lending associations, or have issued first mortgage bonds, generally         may not loan or advance any funds to CenturyTel, but may pay dividends if         certain financial ratios are met. At December 31, 2006, restricted net assets         of         subsidiaries were $145.8 million and subsidiaries retained earnings in excess         of amounts restricted by debt covenants totaled $1.6 billion. At December         31,         2006, approximately $2.2 billion of our consolidated retained earnings reflected         on the balance sheet was available under our loan agreements for the declaration         of dividends.
83 Table             of Contents The         senior notes and debentures of CenturyTel referred to above were issued under         an         indenture dated March 31, 1994. This indenture does not contain any financial         covenants, but does include restrictions that limit our ability to (i) incur,         issue or create liens upon its property and (ii) consolidate with or merge         into,         or transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets to, any other         party.         The indenture does not contain any provisions that are impacted by our credit         ratings, or that restrict the issuance of new securities in the event of         a         material adverse change to us.
Approximately         15% of our property, plant and equipment is pledged to secure the long-term         debt         of subsidiaries.
In         May         2002, we issued         and sold in an underwritten public offering $500 million of equity units,         each         of which were priced at $25 and consisted initially of a beneficial interest         in         a CenturyTel senior unsecured note (Series J, due 2007 and remarketable in         2005)         with a principal amount of $25 and a contract to purchase shares of CenturyTel         common stock no later than May 2005. Each purchase contract generally required         the holder to purchase between .6944 and .8741 of a share of CenturyTel common         stock on May 16, 2005 in exchange for $25, subject to certain adjustments         and         exceptions.
In         February 2005, we remarketed substantially all of our $500 million of         outstanding Series J senior notes due 2007 (the notes described above), at         an         interest rate of 4.628%. We received no proceeds in connection with the         remarketing as all net proceeds were held in trust to secure the equity unit         holders obligation to purchase common stock from us on May 16, 2005. In         connection with the remarketing, we purchased and retired approximately $400         million of the notes, resulting in approximately $100 million remaining         outstanding. We incurred a pre-tax charge of approximately $6.0 million in         the         first quarter of 2005 related to purchasing and retiring the notes. Proceeds         to         purchase such notes came from the February 2005 issuance of $350 million         of 5%         senior notes, Series M, due 2015 and cash on hand.
Between         April 15, 2005 and May 4, 2005, we repurchased and cancelled an aggregate         of         approximately 4.1 million of our equity units in privately-negotiated         transactions with six institutional holders at an average price of $25.18         per         unit. The remaining 15.9 million equity units outstanding on May 16, 2005         were         settled in stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of the purchase         contract that formed a part of such unit.
Accordingly,         on May 16, 2005, we received proceeds of approximately $398.2 million and         issued         approximately 12.9 million common shares in the aggregate. See Note 9 for         information on our accelerated share repurchase program which mitigated the         dilutive impact of issuing these 12.9 million shares.
As         of         December 31, 2006, we had available a $750 million five-year revolving credit         facility, which had no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2006. Our commercial         paper program had $23 million outstanding as of December 31,         2006.
84 Table             of Contents In         2002,         we issued $165 million of convertible senior debentures, Series K, due 2032         (which bear interest at 4.75% and which may be converted under certain specified         circumstances into shares of CenturyTel common stock at a conversion price         of         $40.455 per share). Holders of the convertible senior debentures will have         the         right to require us to purchase all or a portion of the debentures on August         1,         2010 and August 1, 2017. In each case, the purchase price payable will be         equal         to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures to be purchased plus any         accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date. For purchases on or after         August 1, 2010, we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares         of our         common stock, or any combination thereof (except that we will pay any accrued         and unpaid interest in cash).
(6) DERIVATIVE                   INSTRUMENTS In         2003,         we entered into four separate fair value interest rate hedges associated         with         the full $500 million principal amount of our Series L senior notes, due         2012,         that pay interest at a fixed rate of 7.875%. These hedges are fixed to         variable interest rate swaps that effectively convert our fixed rate interest         payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable rates         that range from the six-month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus         3.229% to the six-month LIBOR plus 3.67%, with settlement and rate reset         dates         occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedges in August         2012.         During 2006, we realized an average interest rate under these hedges of 9.03%.         Interest expense was increased by $5.8 million during 2006 as a result of         these         hedges. The aggregate fair value of such hedges at December 31, 2006 was         $20.6         million and is reflected on the accompanying balance sheet as both a liability         (included in Deferred credits and other liabilities) and as a decrease to our         underlying long-term debt.
In         late         2004 and early 2005, we entered into several cash flow hedges that effectively         locked in the interest rate on a majority of certain anticipated debt         transactions that we ultimately completed in February 2005. We locked in         the         interest rate on (i) $100 million of 2.25-year debt (remarketed in February         2005) at 3.9%; (ii) $75 million of 10-year debt (issued in February 2005)         at         5.4%; and (iii) $225 million of 10-year debt (issued in February 2005) at         5.5%.         In February 2005, upon settlement of such hedges, we (i) received $366,000         related to the 2.25-year debt remarketing, which is being amortized as a         reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt, and (ii)         paid         $7.7 million related to the 10-year debt issuance, which is being amortized         as         an increase in interest expense over the 10-year term of the         debt.
85 Table             of Contents (7) DEFERRED                   CREDITS AND OTHER LIABILITIES Deferred         credits and other liabilities at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were composed         of the         following: December                   31, 2006 2005 (Dollars                   in thousands) Deferred                   federal and state income taxes $ 673,061 670,420 Accrued                   postretirement benefit costs 327,337 241,153 Deferred                   revenue 99,669 19,554 Accrued                   pension costs 36,784 - Fair                   value of interest rate swap 20,593 17,645 Additional                   minimum pension liability - 11,662 Minority                   interest 9,226 8,372 Other 52,969 54,328 $ 1,219,639 1,023,134 In         connection with the application of SAB 108 (see Note 1), we established deferred         revenues and costs associated with installation activities effective as of         January 1, 2006.
(8) REDUCTION                   IN WORKFORCE On         March         1, 2006 and August 30, 2006, we announced workforce reductions involving         an         aggregate of approximately 400 jobs, or 6% of our workforce, primarily due         to         increased competitive pressures and the loss of access lines over the last         several years. For 2006, we incurred a net pre-tax charge of approximately         $7.5         million (consisting of a $9.4 million charge to operating expenses, net of         a         $1.9 million favorable revenue impact related to such expenses) in connection         with severance and related costs. Of the $9.4 million charged to operating         expenses, approximately $8.6 million was reflected in cost of services and         products and $845,000 was reflected in selling, general and administrative         expenses. The following table reflects additional information regarding the         severance-related liability for 2006 (in thousands): Balance                   at December 31, 2005 $ - Amount                   accrued to expense 9,431 Adjustments                   to accrual amounts (529 ) Amount                   paid (8,445 ) Balance                   at December 31, 2006 $ 457 86 Table             of Contents (9) STOCKHOLDERS                   EQUITY Common         stock -         Unissued shares of CenturyTel common stock were reserved as         follows: December                   31, 2006 (In                   thousands) Incentive                   compensation programs 7,669 Acquisitions 4,064 Employee                   stock purchase plan 4,552 Dividend                   reinvestment plan 315 Conversion                   of convertible preferred stock 406 Other                   employee benefit plans 1,505 18,511 In         accordance with previously announced stock repurchase programs, we repurchased         21.4 million shares (for $802.2 million), 16.4 million shares (for $551.8         million) and 13.4 million shares (for $401.0 million) in 2006, 2005 and 2004,         respectively. The 2006 and 2005 repurchases included 14.36 million and 12.9         million shares, respectively, repurchased (for a total price of $528.4 and         $437.5 million, respectively) under accelerated share repurchase agreements         (see         below for additional information).
On         February 21, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program         authorizing us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock and         terminated the approximately $13 million remaining balance of our existing         $200         million share repurchase program approved in February 2005. In February 2006,         we         repurchased the first $500 million of common stock through accelerated share         repurchase agreements entered into with various investment banks, repurchasing         and retiring approximately 14.36 million shares of common stock at an average         initial price of $34.83 per share. We funded repurchases under these agreements         through short-term borrowings and cash on hand. As part of the accelerated         share         repurchase transactions, we simultaneously entered into forward contracts         with         the investment banks whereby the investment banks purchased an aggregate         of         14.36 million shares of our common stock during the terms of the contracts.         At         the end of the repurchase period in mid-July 2006, we paid an aggregate of         approximately $28.4 million cash to the investment banks to compensate them         for         the difference between their weighted average purchase price during the         repurchase period and the initial average price. We reflected such settlement         amount as an adjustment to retained earnings in our financial statements         during         2006.
In         late         May 2005, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements with three         investment banks whereby we repurchased and retired approximately 12.9 million         shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $416.5 million cash (or an         initial average price of $32.34 per share). We funded this purchase using         the         proceeds received from the settlement of the equity units mentioned in Note         5         and from cash on hand. As part of the accelerated share repurchase transactions,         we simultaneously entered into forward contracts with the investment banks         whereby the investment banks purchased an aggregate of 12.9 million shares         of         our common stock during the term of the contracts. At the end of the repurchase         period, we paid an aggregate of approximately $21.0 million cash to the         investment banks to compensate them for the difference between their weighted         average purchase price during the repurchase period and the initial average         price. We reflected such settlement amount as an adjustment to paid-in capital.
87 Table             of Contents During         2006, our stockholders equity was reduced by approximately $97.9 million upon         the adoption of SFAS 158 and increased approximately $9.7 million upon the         application of SAB 108. See Note 1 for additional information.
Under         CenturyTels Articles of Incorporation each share of common stock beneficially         owned continuously by the same person since May 30, 1987 generally entitles         the         holder thereof to ten votes per share. All other shares entitle the holder         to         one vote per share. At December 31, 2006, the holders of 5.0 million shares         of         common stock were entitled to ten votes per share.
Preferred         stock - As of         December 31, 2006, we had 2.0 million shares of authorized preferred stock,         $25         par value per share. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were 298,000 and         314,000 shares, respectively, of outstanding convertible preferred stock.         Holders of outstanding CenturyTel preferred stock are entitled to receive         cumulative dividends, receive preferential distributions equal to $25 per         share         plus unpaid dividends upon CenturyTels liquidation and vote as a single class         with the holders of common stock.
Shareholders         Rights Plan - On         November 1, 2006, our 1996 rights agreement (and each preference share purchase         right issued thereunder) lapsed in accordance with its stated         terms.
(10) POSTRETIREMENT                   BENEFITS We         sponsor health care plans (which use a December 31 measurement date) that         provide postretirement benefits to all qualified retired employees.
In         May         2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Statement         Position FAS 106-2, which provides accounting guidance to sponsors of         postretirement health care plans that are impacted by the Medicare Prescription         Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). We believe that         certain drug benefits offered under our postretirement health care plans         will         qualify for subsidy under Medicare Part D. In the third quarter of 2004,         we         estimated that the effect of the Act on us would not be material and reflected         the effects of the Act as of the December 31, 2004 measurement date. As of         this         date, we estimated that the reduction in our accumulated benefit obligation         attributable to prior service cost was approximately $7 million and reflected         such amount as an actuarial gain.
88 Table             of Contents In         2005,         in connection with negotiating certain union contracts, we amended certain         retiree contribution and retirement eligibility provisions of our plan.
The         following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the         benefit obligation and the plan assets.

The estimated amount of amortization expense         (income) of the above unrecognized items that will be amortized from accumulated         other comprehensive loss and reflected as a component of net periodic pension         cost during 2007 are (i) ($2.0 million) for the prior service credit and         (ii)         $3.2 million for the net actuarial loss. See Note 1 for additional         information.
Assumptions         used in accounting for postretirement benefits as of December 31, 2006 and         2005         were: 2006 2005 Determination                   of benefit obligation Discount                   rate 5.75 % 5.5 Healthcare                   cost increase trend rates (Medical/Prescription Drug) Following                   year 8.0/11.0 % 9.0/14.0 Rate                   to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate                   cost                   trend rate) 5.0/5.0 % 5.0/5.0 Year                   that the rate reaches the ultimate cost trend rate 2010/2013 2010/2015 Determination                   of benefit cost Discount                   rate 5.50 % 5.75 Expected                   return on plan assets 8.25 % 8.25 We         employ         a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income         investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for         a         prudent level of risk. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses         by outperforming plan liabilities over the long term. Risk tolerance is         established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded         status and corporate financial condition. We measure and monitor investment         risk         on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset         studies and periodic portfolio reviews.
Our         postretirement benefit plan weighted-average asset allocations at December         31,         2006 and 2005 by asset category are as follows: 2006 2005 Equity                   securities 60.1 % 60.2 Debt                   securities 27.9 31.4 Other 12.0 8.4 Total 100.0 % 100.0 In         determining the expected return on plan assets, we study historical markets         and         apply the widely-accepted capital market principle that assets with higher         volatility and risk generate a greater return over the long term. We evaluate         current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before determining         long-term capital market assumptions. We also review peer data and historical         returns to check for reasonableness.
90 Table             of Contents Assumed         health care cost trends have a significant effect on the amounts reported         for         postretirement benefit plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health         care cost rates would have the following effects: 1-Percentage                   Point Increase 1-Percentage                   Point Decrease (Dollars                   in thousands) Effect                   on annual total of service and interest cost components $ 243 (312 ) Effect                   on postretirement benefit obligation $ 3,775 (4,729 ) We         expect         to contribute approximately $16.7 million to our postretirement benefit plan         in         2007.

Our         aggregate accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2006 and 2005         was         $407.2 million and $392.3 million, respectively.
93 Table             of Contents Assumptions         used in accounting for the pension plans as of December 2006 and 2005         were: 2006 2005 Determination                   of benefit obligation Discount                   rate 5.8 % 5.5 Weighted                   average rate of compensation increase 4.0 % 4.0 Determination                   of benefit cost Discount                   rate 5.5 % 5.75 Weighted                   average rate of compensation increase 4.0 % 4.0 Expected                   long-term rate of return on assets 8.25 % 8.25 We         employ         a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income         investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for         a         prudent level of risk. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses         by outperforming plan liabilities over the long term. Risk tolerance is         established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded         status and corporate financial condition. We measure and monitor investment         risk         on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset         studies and periodic portfolio reviews.
Our         pension plans weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, 2006 and         2005         by asset category are as follows: 2006 2005 Equity                   securities 71.7 % 69.5 Debt                   securities 25.8 28.0 Other 2.5 2.5 Total 100.0 % 100.0 In         determining the expected return on plan assets, we study historical markets         and         apply the widely-accepted capital market principle that assets with higher         volatility and risk generate a greater return over the long term. We evaluate         current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before determining         long-term capital market assumptions. We also review peer data and historical         returns to check for reasonableness.
The         amount of the 2007 contribution will be determined based on a number of factors,         including the results of the 2007 actuarial valuation report. At this time,         the         amount of the 2007 contribution is not known.
Our         estimated future projected benefit payments under our defined benefit pension         plans are as follows: 2007 - $24.3 million; 2008 - $27.1 million; 2009 -         $29.0         million; 2010 - $31.4 million; 2011 - $33.9 million; and 2012-2016 - $199.5         million.
Through         December 31, 2006, we also sponsored an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)         which covers most employees with one year of service and is funded by our         contributions determined annually by the Board of Directors. Our expense         related         to the ESOP during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $7.9 million, $7.3 million, and         $8.1         million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, the ESOP owned an aggregate         of 3.4         million shares of CenturyTel common stock. After 2006, our contribution to         the         ESOP will be discontinued.
94 Table             of Contents We         also         sponsor qualified profit sharing plans pursuant to Section 401(k) of the         Internal Revenue Code (the 401(k) Plans) which are available to substantially         all employees. Our matching contributions to the 401(k) Plans were $8.6 million         in 2006, $8.5 million in 2005 and $9.1 million in 2004. Our matching         contribution to the 401(k) Plans will increase in 2007, but such increase         will         be less than the reduction from the discontinuance of the ESOP contributions         mentioned above.

We         establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce the deferred tax         assets         to amounts we expect to realize. As of December 31, 2006, we had available         tax         benefits associated with net state operating loss carryforwards, which expire         through 2026, of $61.9 million. The ultimate realization of the benefits         of the         carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during         the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider         our scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable         income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result         of         such assessment, we reserved $61.0 million through the valuation allowance         as of         December 31, 2006 as it is more likely than not that this amount of net         operating loss carryforwards will not be utilized prior to expiration. Income         tax expense was reduced by approximately $6.4 million in 2006 due to the         resolution of various income tax audit issues. Income tax expense for 2005         was         increased by $19.5 million as a result of increasing the valuation allowance         related to net state operating loss carryforwards. This increase was primarily         due to changes in state income tax laws and other factors which impacted         the         projections of future taxable income.

Accordingly, the estimated shares issuable based on the fair value         of         the forward contract was included in the weighted average shares outstanding         for         the computation of diluted earnings per share.
The         weighted average number of shares of common stock subject to issuance under         outstanding options that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings         per share because the exercise price of the option was greater than the average         market price of the common stock was 1.0 million for 2006, 1.8 million for         2005         and 2.4 million for 2004.
97 Table             of Contents (14) STOCK                   COMPENSATION PROGRAMS Effective         January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting         Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)). SFAS         123(R) requires us to measure our cost of awarding employees with equity         instruments based upon the fair value of the award on the grant date. Such         cost         will be recognized as compensation expense over the period during which the         employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Compensation         cost is also recognized over the applicable remaining vesting period for         any         outstanding options that were not fully vested as of January 1, 2006. We         did not         have any unvested outstanding options as of January 1, 2006 since our Board         of         Directors accelerated the vesting of all unvested options effective as of         December 31, 2005, as described below. We elected the modified prospective         transition method as permitted by SFAS 123(R); accordingly, we did not restate         prior period results.
We         currently maintain programs which allow the Board of Directors, through its         Compensation Committee, to grant incentives to certain employees and our         outside         directors in any one or a combination of several forms, including incentive         and         non-qualified stock options; stock appreciation rights; restricted stock;         and         performance shares. As of December 31, 2006, we had reserved approximately         7.7         million shares of common stock which may be issued in connection with incentive         awards made in the future under our current incentive programs. We also offer         an         Employee Stock Purchase Plan whereby employees can purchase our common stock         at         a 15% discount based on the lower of the beginning or ending stock price         during         recurring six-month periods stipulated in such program.
As         of         December 31, 2005, we had approximately 6.0 million options outstanding from         prior grants, all of which were issued with exercise prices either equal         to or         exceeding the then-current market price. All of these options were exercisable         as a result of actions taken by our Board of Directors in December 2005 to         accelerate the vesting of all unvested options outstanding, effective as         of         December 31, 2005, in order to eliminate the recognition of compensation         expense         which otherwise would have been required upon the effectiveness of SFAS         123(R).
During         2006 we granted 1,007,175 stock options with exercise prices at market value.         All of these options expire ten years after the date of grant and have a         three-year vesting period. The weighted average fair value of each option         was         estimated as of the date of grant to be $12.75 using a Black-Scholes option         pricing model using the following assumptions: dividend yield - .7%; expected         volatility - 30%; weighted average risk free interest rate - 4.65% (rates         ranged         from 4.28% to 5.22%); and expected term - 7 years (executive officers) and         5         years (all other employees).
During         2005 we granted 1,015,025 stock options with exercise prices at market value.         The weighted average fair value of each of the 2005 options was estimated         as of         the date of grant to be $12.68 using an option-pricing model with the following         assumptions: dividend yield - .7%; expected volatility - 30%; weighted average         risk-free interest rate - 4.2%; and expected option life - seven         years.
98 Table             of Contents During         2004 we granted 952,975 stock options with exercise prices at market value.         The         weighted average fair value of each of the 2004 options was estimated as         of the         date of grant to be $10.25 using an option-pricing model with the following         assumptions: dividend yield - .7%; expected volatility - 30%; weighted average         risk-free interest rate - 3.6%; and expected option life - seven         years.
The         expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of our common         stock         over the 7- and 5- year terms mentioned above. The expected term was determined         based on the historical exercise and forfeiture rates for similar         grants.
Stock         option transactions during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Number of                   options Average price Remaining                   contractual term                   (in years) Aggregate                   intrinsic value Outstanding                   December 31, 2003 6,734,572 $ 28.14 Granted 952,975 22.96 Exercised (827,486 ) 28.22 Forfeited/Cancelled (146,503 ) 27.90 Outstanding                   December 31, 2004 6,713,558 $ 28.79 Granted 1,015,025 25.04 Exercised (1,664,625 ) 33.69 Forfeited/Cancelled (68,500 ) 31.40 Outstanding                   December 31, 2005 5,995,458 $ 30.63 Granted 1,007,175 35.98 Exercised (3,047,918 ) 29.15 Forfeited/Cancelled (58,916 ) 32.54 Outstanding                   December 31, 2006 3,895,799 $ 33.14 6.5 $ 40,967,000 Exercisable                   December 31, 2006 2,918,724 $ 32.20 5.7 $ 33,452,000 In         addition, during 2006, we issued 293,943 shares of restricted stock to certain         employees and our outside directors at a weighted-average price of $36.02         per         share. During 2005, we issued 286,123 shares of restricted stock at a         weighted-average price of $33.47 per share, and during 2004, we issued 227,075         shares of restricted stock at a weighted-average price of $27.63 per share.         Such         restricted stock vests over a five-year period (for employees) and a three-year         period (for outside directors). Nonvested restricted stock transactions during         2006 were as follows: Number of                   shares Average                   grant date                   fair value Nonvested                   at January 1, 2006 511,919 $ 30.92 Granted 293,943 36.02 Vested (80,641 ) 32.58 Forfeited (13,133 ) 30.70 Nonvested                   at December 31, 2006 712,088 $ 32.84 99 Table             of Contents The         total         compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements in 2006, 2005 and         2004         was $11.9 million, $4.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively. We recognized         a         tax benefit related to such arrangements of approximately $4.5 million in         2006,         $1.8 million in 2005 and $491,000 in 2004. As of December 31, 2006, there         was         $22.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the share-based         payment arrangements, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average         period of 3.0 years.
We         received net cash proceeds of $88.8 million during 2006 in connection with         option exercises. The total intrinsic value of options exercised (the amount         by         which the market price of the stock on the date of exercise exceeded the         market         price of the stock on the date of grant) was $31.0 million during 2006, $16.3         million during 2005 and $8.6 million during 2004. The excess tax benefit         realized from stock options exercised and restricted stock released during         2006         was $12.0 million. The total fair value of restricted stock that vested during         2006, 2005 and 2004 was $2.6 million, $208,000 and $1.3 million, respectively.
Prior         to         January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock compensation plans using the intrinsic         value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,         Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as allowed by Statement of Financial         Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS         123). Options have been granted at a price either equal to or exceeding the         then-current market price. Accordingly, we did not recognize compensation         cost         in connection with issuing stock options prior to January 1, 2006. If         compensation cost for our options had been determined consistent with SFAS         123(R), our net income and earnings per share on a pro forma basis for 2005         and         2004 would have been as follows: Year                   ended December 31, 2005 2004 (Dollars                   in thousands, except per share amounts) Net                   income, as reported $ 334,479 337,244 Add:                   Stock-based compensation expense reflected in net income, net of                   tax 96 - Less:                   Total stock-based compensation expense determined under fair value                   based                   method, net of tax (12,537 ) (9,767 ) Pro                   forma net income $ 322,038 327,477 Basic                   earnings per share As                   reported $ 2.55 2.45 Pro                   forma $ 2.46 2.38 Diluted                   earnings per share As                   reported $ 2.49 2.41 Pro                   forma $ 2.40 2.34 100 Table             of Contents (15) GAIN                   ON ASSET DISPOSITIONS In         April         2006, upon dissolution of the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB), we received $122.8         million in cash for redemption of our investment in stock of the RTB and         recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $117.8 million in the second quarter         of         2006 related to this transaction. In May 2006, we sold the assets of our         local         exchange operations in Arizona for approximately $5.9 million cash and recorded         a pre-tax gain of approximately $866,000 in the second quarter of 2006. Such         gains are included in Other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of         Income.

Income taxes paid were $212.4 million in 2006, $88.8 million         in         2005 and $129.9 million in 2004. Income tax refunds totaled $3.0 million         in         2006, $4.9 million in 2005 and $8.9 million in 2004.
We         have         consummated the acquisitions of various operations, along with certain other         assets, during the three years ended December 31, 2006. In connection with         these         acquisitions, the following assets were acquired and liabilities assumed: Year                   ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars                   in thousands) Property,                   plant and equipment, net $ - 66,450 - Goodwill - - 5,274 Deferred                   credits and other liabilities - - (3,381 ) Other                   assets and liabilities, excluding cash                   and cash equivalents 5,222 9,003 107 Decrease                   in cash due to acquisitions $ 5,222 75,453 2,000 101 Table             of Contents (17) FAIR                   VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The         following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of         certain of our financial instruments at December 31, 2006 and 2005.
Carrying                   Amount Fair                   value (Dollars                   in thousands) December                   31, 2006 Financial                   assets $ 110,134 110,134 (2) Financial                   liabilities Long-term                   debt (including current maturities) $ 2,567,864 2,522,347 (1) Interest                   rate swaps $ 20,593 20,593 (2) Other $ 51,614 51,614 (2) December                   31, 2005 Financial                   assets $ 110,912 228,651 (2) Financial                   liabilities Long-term                   debt (including current maturities) $ 2,652,806 2,648,843 (1) Interest                   rate swaps $ 17,645 17,645 (2) Other $ 48,917 48,917 (2) (1) Fair                   value was estimated by discounting the scheduled payment streams                   to                   present value based upon rates currently available to us for similar                   debt.
(2) Fair                   value was estimated by us to approximate carrying value or is based                   on                   current market information (see below for further                   information).
Included         in Financial Assets at December 31, 2005 was our investment in stock of the         RTB.         The carrying value of our investment in RTB stock ($5.1 million) was reflected         on the balance sheet on the cost basis and did not include the cumulative         stock         dividends earned. In 2006, upon dissolution of the RTB, we received $122.8         million in cash for redemption of our investment in stock of the RTB and         recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $117.8 million in 2006 related to         this         transaction.
We         believe the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,         short-term debt, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates the fair         value due to the short maturity of these instruments and have not been reflected         in the above table.
102 Table             of Contents (18) BUSINESS                   SEGMENTS We         are an         integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array         of         communications services to our customers, including local exchange, long         distance, Internet access and broadband services. We strive to maintain our         customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service offerings         to         provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications         services. As a result of increased bundling of our local exchange and long         distance service offerings, beginning in 2006, we have combined the revenues         of         such offerings into a category entitled Voice. Prior periods have been         restated to insure comparability.
Our         operating revenues for our products and services include the following         components: Year                   ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars                   in thousands) Voice $ 860,741 892,272 903,025 Network                   access 878,702 959,838 966,011 Data 351,495 318,770 275,777 Fiber                   transport and CLEC 149,088 115,454 74,409 Other 207,704 192,918 188,150 Total                   operating revenues $ 2,447,730 2,479,252 2,407,372 For         a         description of each of the sources of revenues, see Managements Discussion and         Analysis of Financial Conditionand Results of Operations - Operating         Revenues.
Interexchange         carriers and other accounts receivable on the balance sheets are primarily         amounts due from various long distance carriers, principally AT&T, and         several large local exchange operating companies.
(19) COMMITMENTS                   AND CONTINGENCIES Construction         expenditures and investments in vehicles, buildings and equipment during         2007         are estimated to be $325 million. We generally do not enter into firm, committed         contracts for such activities.
In Barbrasue         Beattie and James Sovis, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly         situated, v. CenturyTel, Inc.
,         filed         on October 28, 2002, in the United States District Court for the Eastern         District of Michigan (Case No. 02-10277), the plaintiffs allege that we unjustly         and unreasonably billed customers for inside wire maintenance services, and         seek         unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief under various legal theories         on behalf of a purported class of over two million customers in our telephone         markets. On March 10, 2006, the Court certified a class of plaintiffs and         issued         a ruling that the billing descriptions we used for these services during         an         approximately 18-month period between October 2000 and May 2002 were legally         insufficient. We have appealed this class certification decision, although         we         cannot predict the length of time before this appeal will be adjudicated.         Our         preliminary analysis indicates that we billed less than $9 million for inside         wire maintenance services under the billing descriptions and time periods         specified in the District Court ruling described above.Should other         billing descriptions be determined to be inadequate or if claims are allowed         for         additional time periods, the amount of our potential exposure could increase         significantly. The Courts order does not specify the award of damages, the         scope and amountsof which, if any, remain subject to additional         fact-finding and resolution of what we believe are valid defenses to plaintiff's         claims.Accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount or range of         possible loss at this time.However, considering the one-time nature of any         adverse result, wedo not believe that the ultimate outcome of this         litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position         or         on-goingresults of operations.
103 Table             of Contents The         Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local exchange carriers to file access         tariffs on a streamlined basis and, if certain criteria are met, deems those         tariffs lawful. Tariffs that have been deemed lawful in effect nullify an         interexchange carriers ability to seek refunds should the earnings from the         tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized rate of return         prescribed by the FCC. Certain of our telephone subsidiaries file interstate         tariffs with the FCC using this streamlined filing approach. Since July 2004,         we         have recognized billings from our tariffs as revenue since we believe such         tariffs are deemed lawful. For those billings from tariffs prior to July 2004,         we initially recorded as a liability our earnings in excess of the authorized         rate of return, and may thereafter recognize as revenue some or all of these         amounts at the end of the applicable settlement period or as our legal         entitlement thereto becomes certain. As of December 31, 2006, the amount         of our         earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return reflected as a liability         on         the balance sheet for the 2003/2004 monitoring period aggregated approximately         $43 million. The settlement period related to the 2003/2004 monitoring period         lapses on September 30, 2007.
As         discussed above in Note 15, we received approximately $122.8 million in cash         from the dissolution of the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB). Some portion of the         gain recognized in connection with the receipt of these proceeds, while not         estimable at this time, is currently or may be subject to review by regulatory         authorities which may result in us recording a regulatory         liability.
In         March         2006, we filed a complaint against AT&T Corp. and AT&T Communications,         Inc. (collectively, AT&T) in the United States District Court for the         District of New Jersey. This lawsuit currently includes 24 other local exchange         company plaintiffs. Our complaint seeks recovery from AT&T of unpaid and         underpaid access charges for calls made using AT&Ts prepaid calling cards         and calls that used Internet Protocol (IP) for a portion of their         transmission. We believe AT&T improperly classified certain of the prepaid         calling card calls as interstate traffic rather than intrastate traffic,         thereby         depriving us of the higher access rates associated with intrastate calls.         We         also believe that AT&T improperly classified the calls that used IP for a         portion of their transmission as local calls, thereby depriving us of access         rates entirely. AT&T has filed a counterclaim against us, asserting that we         improperly billed AT&T terminating intrastate access charges on certain         wireless roaming traffic. At this time, the likely outcome of these cases         cannot         be predicted, nor can a reasonable estimate of the amount of recovery or         payment, if any, be made. Accordingly, we have not recognized any amounts         with         respect to these matters in our consolidated financial statements.
104 Table             of Contents From         time         to time, we are involved in other proceedings incidental to our business,         including administrative hearings of state public utility commissions relating         primarily to rate making, actions relating to employee claims, occasional         grievance hearings before labor regulatory agencies and miscellaneous third         party tort actions. The outcome of these other proceedings is not predictable.         However, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these other         proceedings, after considering available insurance coverage, will have a         material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations         or cash         flows.

Controls                   and Procedures Evaluation         of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
We         maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable         assurances that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports         we         file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is timely recorded, processed,         summarized and reported as required. Our Chief Executive Officer, Glen F.         Post,         III, and our Chief Financial Officer, R. Stewart Ewing, Jr., have evaluated         our         disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006. Based on the         evaluation, Messrs. Post and Ewing concluded that our disclosure controls         and         procedures have been effective in providing reasonable assurance that they         have         been timely alerted of material information required to be filed in this         annual         report. Since the date of Messrs. Posts and Ewings most recent evaluation,         there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other         factors that could significantly affect these controls. The design of any         system         of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood         of         future events and contingencies, and there can be no assurance that any design         will succeed in achieving our stated goals. Because of the inherent limitations         in any control system, you should be aware that misstatements due to error         or         fraud could occur and not be detected.
Reports         on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting.
We         incorporate by reference into this Item 9A the reports appearing at the         forefront of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
