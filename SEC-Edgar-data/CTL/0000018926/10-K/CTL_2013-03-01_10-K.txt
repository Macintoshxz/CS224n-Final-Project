PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview We are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services to our residential, business, governmental and wholesale customers. Our communications services include local and long-distance, network access, private line (including special access), public access, broadband, data, managed hosting (including cloud hosting), colocation, wireless and video services. In certain local and regional markets, we also provide local access and fiber transport services to competitive local exchange carriers ("CLECs") and security monitoring. We strive to maintain our customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications services.
Based on our 13.7million of total access lines at December31, 2012, we were the third largest telecommunications company in the United States. We operate almost 75% of our total access lines in portions of Colorado, Washington, Arizona, Minnesota, Florida, North Carolina, Oregon, Iowa, Utah, New Mexico, Missouri and Nevada. We also provide local service in portions of Idaho, Ohio, Wisconsin, Virginia, Texas, Pennsylvania, Montana, Alabama, Nebraska, Indiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Wyoming, New Jersey, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, Michigan, Louisiana, South Carolina, Illinois, Georgia, Mississippi, Oklahoma and California. In the portion of these 37 states where we have access lines, which we refer to as our local service area, we are the incumbent local telephone company. We also operate 54 data centers throughout North America, Europe and Asia. We define a data center as any facility where we market, sell and deliver either colocation services or multi-tenant managed services, or both.
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Louisiana in 1968. Our principal executive offices are located at 100 CenturyLink Drive, Monroe, Louisiana 71203 and our telephone number is (318)388-9000.
For a discussion of certain risks applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations, see "Risk Factors" in Item1A of this report. The summary financial information in this section should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Item8 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item7 of this report.
Acquisitions Acquisition of Savvis On July15, 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Savvis, a provider of cloud hosting, managed hosting, colocation and network services in domestic and international markets. We believe this acquisition enhanced our ability to provide information technology services to our existing business customers and strengthened our ability to attract new business customers. Each share of Savvis common stock outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition converted into the right to receive $30 per share in cash and 0.2479 shares of CenturyLink common stock. The aggregate consideration of $2.382billion was based on:  cash payments of $1.732billion; 3 Table of Contents  the 14.313million shares of CenturyLink common stock issued to consummate the acquisition;  the closing stock price of CenturyLink common stock at July14, 2011 of $38.54; and  the estimated net value of the pre-combination portion of certain share-based compensation awards assumed by CenturyLink of $98million, of which $33million was paid in cash.
Upon completing the acquisition, we also paid $547million to retire certain pre-existing Savvis debt and accrued interest.
Acquisition of Qwest On April1, 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Qwest, a provider of data, broadband, video and voice services nationwide and globally. We entered into this acquisition, among other things, to realize certain strategic benefits, including enhanced financial and operational scale, market diversification and leveraged combined networks. As of the acquisition date, Qwest served approximately 9.0million access lines and approximately 3.0million broadband subscribers across 14 states. Each share of Qwest common stock outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition converted into the right to receive 0.1664 shares of CenturyLink common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. The aggregate consideration of $12.273billion was based on:  the 294million shares of CenturyLink common stock issued to consummate the acquisition;  the closing stock price of CenturyLink common stock at March31, 2011 of $41.55;  the estimated net value of the pre-combination portion of share-based compensation awards assumed by CenturyLink of $52million (excluding the value of restricted stock included in the number of issued shares specified above); and  cash paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of $5million.
We assumed approximately $12.7billion of long-term debt in connection with our acquisition of Qwest.
Effect of Recent Acquisitions Our acquisitions in 2011 resulted in several important changes to our operations, including:  providing services to an expanded number of densely-populated markets, which tend to afford consumers access to a greater range of competitive communications products than less dense markets;  reducing the percentage of our total revenue derived from governmental support programs, which typically focus on disbursing payments to companies operating in less densely-populated areas;  expanding and reconfiguring our operating regions to incorporate the Qwest service areas in order to provide day-to-day decision making at the regional level as opposed to the more centralized structures formerly used by Qwest; and  offering certain services, such as cloud hosting, that CenturyLink did not historically provide.
Other Acquisitions On July1, 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Embarq Corporation ("Embarq"), a provider of data, Internet, video and voice services for stock valued at approximately $6.1billion on the acquisition date. As of the acquisition date, Embarq served approximately 5.4million access lines and approximately 1.5million broadband subscribers across 18 states. We assumed approximately $4.9billion of long-term debt in connection with our acquisition of Embarq.
4 Table of Contents We regularly evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional assets in exchange for cash, securities or other properties, and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions. We generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement.
References to Acquired Businesses In the discussion that follows, we refer to the incremental business activities that we now operate as a result of the Savvis acquisition and the Qwest acquisition as "Legacy Savvis" and "Legacy Qwest", respectively. References to "Legacy CenturyLink", when used in comparison of our consolidated results for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, mean the business we operated prior to the Qwest and Savvis acquisitions.
Financial and Operational Highlights The following table summarizes the results of our consolidated operations. Our operating results include the operations of Savvis for periods after July15, 2011 and Qwest for periods after April1, 2011.
Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Operating revenues $ 18,376 15,351 7,042 Operating expenses 15,663 13,326 4,982 Operating income $ 2,713 2,025 2,060 Net income $ 777 573 948 December31, 2012 2011 (Dollars in millions) Balance sheet data: Total assets $ 54,020 56,044 Total long-term debt (1) 20,605 21,836 Total stockholders' equity 19,289 20,827 (1) Total long-term debt is the sum of current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. For total obligations, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFuture Contractual Obligations" in Item7 of this report.
The following table summarizes certain of our operational metrics: As of December31, 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands) Operational metrics: Total broadband subscribers (1) 5,848 5,652 2,349 Total access lines (2) 13,748 14,584 6,489 (1) Broadband subscribers are customers that purchase high-speed Internet connection service through their existing telephone lines and fiber-optic cables.
5 Table of Contents (2) Access lines are telephone lines reaching from the customers' premises to a connection with the public switched telephone network, or PSTN.
During the second quarter of 2012, we updated our methodology for counting broadband subscribers to include residential, business and wholesale subscribers instead of only residential and small business subscribers. We have restated our previously reported amounts to reflect this change.
Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States and substantially all of our revenues are from customers located in the United States. We estimate that less than 2% of our consolidated revenue is derived from providing telecommunications and data hosting services outside the United States.
Operations Segments Since acquiring Qwest and Savvis in 2011, we have reorganized our operations and associated reporting segments on three occasions, including in 2012 and early 2013.
During the second quarter of 2012, in order to more effectively deploy the strategic assets acquired from Qwest and Savvis and to better serve our business and government customers, we internally restructured our business into the following operating segments:  Regional markets.
Consists primarily of providing strategic and legacy products and services to residential consumers, state and local governments, small to medium-sized businesses and enterprise customers that in each case are located mainly within one of our six regions. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers include our private line, broadband, MPLS, hosting, video services and wireless services. Our legacy services offered to these customers consist primarily of local and long-distance service;  Wholesale markets.
Consists primarily of providing strategic and legacy products and services to other domestic and international communications providers. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers are mainly private line (including special access) and MPLS. Our legacy services offered to these customers include UNEs which allow our wholesale customers the use of our network or a combination of our network and their own networks to provide voice and data services to their customers, long-distance and switched access services;  Enterprise marketsnetwork.
Consists primarily of providing strategic and legacy network communications products and services to national and international enterprise and government customers. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers include our private line, broadband, MPLS and hosting services. Our legacy services offered to these customers consist primarily of local and long-distance services; and  Enterprise marketsdata hosting.
Consists primarily of providing colocation, managed hosting and cloud hosting services to national and international enterprise and government customers.

On January3, 2013, we announced a reorganization of our operating segments. Beginning with the first quarter of 2013, we will report the following four segments in our consolidated financial statements: consumer, business, wholesale and data hosting. For additional information on this change, please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item7 of this report.
Products and Services Our products and services include a variety of voice, broadband, data, information technology ("IT"), video and other communications services. In 2011, we expanded our IT services to include cloud hosting, managed hosting, colocation and network services.
We offer our customers the ability to bundle together several products and services. For example, we offer integrated and unlimited local and long-distance services. Our customers can also bundle two or more services such as broadband, video (including DIRECTV through our strategic partnership), voice and Verizon Wireless (through our strategic partnership) services. We believe our customers value the convenience and price discounts associated with receiving multiple services through a single company.
Most of our products and services are provided using our telecommunications network, which consists of voice and data switches, copper cables, fiber-optic cables and other equipment. Our network serves approximately 13.7million access lines and formsa portion of the public switched telephone network, or PSTN.
Described below are our key products and services.
Strategic Services Our customers use our strategic services to access the Internet, connect to private networks and transmit data. We also provide value-added services and integrated solutions that make communications more secure, reliable and efficient for our customers. We focus our marketing and sales efforts on these services:  Private line.
Private line (including special access) is a direct circuit or channel specifically dedicated for the purpose of directly connecting two or more sites. Private line offers a 7 Table of Contents high-speed, secure solution for frequent transmission of large amounts of data between sites. We also provide private line transmission services to wireless service providers that use our fiber-optic cables connected to their towers, commonly referred to as fiber to the tower or wireless backhaul services, to support their next generation wireless networks;  Broadband.
Our broadband services allow customers to connect to the Internet through their existing telephone lines and fiber-optic cables at high speeds. Substantially all of our broadband subscribers are located within our local service area;  MPLS.
Multi-Protocol Label Switching is standards-approved data networking technology, compatible with existing asynchronous transfer mode, or ATM, and frame relay networks we provide to support real-time voice and video. This technology allows network operators flexibility to divert and route traffic around link failures, congestion and bottlenecks;  Managed Hosting.
Managed hosting includes provision of centralized IT infrastructure and a variety of managed services including cloud and traditional computing, application management, back-up, storage, and advanced services including planning, design, implementation and support services;  Colocation.
Colocation services enable our customers to install their own IT equipment in our state-of-the art facilities through our centralized IT infrastructure;  Ethernet.
Ethernet services include point-to-point and multi-point configurations that facilitate data transmissions across metropolitan areas and wide area networks;  Video.
Our video services include our facilities-based video, marketed as CenturyLink Prism, which is a premium entertainment service that allows our customers to watch hundreds of television or cable channels and record up to four shows on one home digital video recorder. We also offer satellite digital television under an arrangement with DIRECTV that allows us to market, sell and bill for its services under its brand name;  VoIP.
Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, is a real-time, two-way voice communication service (similar to our traditional voice services) that originates over a broadband connection and often terminates on the PSTN; and  Wireless services.
Our wireless services are offered under an agency arrangement with Verizon Wireless that allows us to market, sell and bill for its services under its brand name, primarily to customers who buy these services as part of a bundle with one or more of our other products and services. This arrangement allows us to sell the full complement of Verizon Wireless services. Our current five-year arrangement with Verizon Wireless runs through 2015 and is terminable by either party thereafter.
Legacy Services Our legacy services represent our traditional voice, data and network services, which include the following:  Local.
We offer local calling services for our regional markets customers within our local service area, generally for a fixed monthly charge. These services include a number of enhanced calling features and other services, such as call forwarding, caller identification, conference calling, voicemail, selective call ringing and call waiting, for which we generally charge an additional monthly fee. We also generate revenues from non-recurring services, such as inside wire installation, maintenance services, service activation and reactivation.
For our wholesale customers, local calling services include primarily resale and UNEs, which allow our wholesale customers to use our network or a combination of our network and their own networks to provide voice and data services to their customers. Local calling services also 8 Table of Contents include network transport, billing services and access to our network by other telecommunications providers and wireless carriers. Local calling services provided to our wholesale customers allow other telecommunications companies the ability to originate or terminate telecommunications services on our network;  Long-distance.
We offer our residential and business customers domestic and international long-distance services and toll-free services. Our international long-distance services include voice calls that either terminate or originate with our customers in the United States;  ISDN.
We offer integrated services digital network ("ISDN") services, which uses regular telephone lines to support voice, video and data applications;  WAN.
We offer wide area network ("WAN") services, which allow a local communications network to link to networks in remote locations; and  Switched access services.
We provide various forms of switched access services to wireline and wireless service providers for the use of our facilities to originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice transmissions.
Data Integration Data integration involves our sale of telecommunications equipment to customers for use on their premises and related professional services. These services include network management, installation and maintenance of telecommunication and data equipment and the building of proprietary fiber-optic networks for our governmental and other business customers.
Other Revenues We also generate other operating revenues from Universal Service Fund ("USF") revenues and surcharges and the leasing and subleasing of space in our office buildings, warehouses and other properties. The majority of our real estate properties are located in our local service area.
Additional Information During 2008, we paid an aggregate of approximately $149million for 69 licenses in the FCC's auction of 700 megahertz wireless spectrum. During the second quarter of 2012, we committed to a plan to sell our Advanced Wireless Services A Block and 700 MHz wireless spectrum in the A, B, and C Blocks, which in the aggregate had a basis of $154million. We sold $58million of our wireless spectrum assets during the fourth quarter of 2012, and we sold another $43million of our wireless spectrum assets in January 2013. In the aggregate, these transactions resulted in a gain of $32million. We expect to reach agreements with various other purchasers for the remaining spectrum, and the consummation of which will be subject to regulatory approval.
From time to time, we also make investments in other communications companies.
For further information on regulatory, technological and competitive changes that could impact our revenues, see "Regulation" and "Competition" under this Item1 below and "Risk Factors" under Item1A below. For more information on the financial contributions of our various services, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item7 of this report.
Patents, Trade Names, Trademarks and Copyrights Either directly or through our subsidiaries, we have rights in various patents, trade names, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property necessary to conduct our business, such as our 9 Table of Contents CenturyLink and Prism brand names. Our services often use the intellectual property of others, including licensed software. We also occasionally license our intellectual property to others.
Sales and Marketing We maintain local offices in most of the larger population centers within our local service area. These offices provide sales and customer support services in the community. We also rely on our call center personnel to promote sales of services that meet the needs of our customers. Our strategy is to enhance our communications services by offering a comprehensive bundle of services and deploying new technologies to further enhance customer loyalty.
We conduct most of our operations under the brand name "CenturyLink." Our satellite television service is offered on a co-branded basis under the "DIRECTV" name. Our switched digital television service offering is branded under the name "Prism." The wireless service that we offer under our agency agreement with Verizon Wireless is marketed under the "Verizon Wireless" brand name. Currently, certain data hosting, IT and other services furnished through our Savvis operations are marketed under the "SAVVIS" or "savvisdirect" brand names.
Our approach to our regional markets' residential customers emphasizes customer-oriented sales, marketing and service with a local presence. We market our products and services primarily through direct sales representatives, inbound call centers, local retail stores, telemarketing and third parties. We support our distribution with direct mail, bill inserts, newspaper advertising, website promotions, public relations activities and sponsorship of community events and sports venues.
Our approach to our regional markets' business and government customers includes a commitment to deliver communications products and services that meet existing and future business needs through bundles of services and integrated service offerings. Our focus is to be a comprehensive communications solution for our small office, mid-sized and select enterprise business and government customers.
Our approach to our wholesale markets' customers includes a commitment to deliver communications solutions that meet existing and future needs of national network telecommunications providers through bandwidth growth and quality of services.
Our approach to our enterprise marketnetwork customers includes a commitment to deliver network products and services that meet existing and future customer needs by offering private line, broadband, MPLS and hosting services and well as local and long-distance services.
Our enterprise marketdata hosting operations utilize a solution-based selling approach. By working directly with potential and existing clients, we are able to understand our clients' IT infrastructure and long-term goals. We also market through indirect channels, including collaborations with existing clients and technology providers, telecommunications companies and system integrators.
Network Architecture Most of our products and services are provided using our telecommunications network, which consists of voice and data switches, copper cables, fiber-optic cables and other equipment. Our local exchange carrier networks also include central offices and remote sites, all with advanced digital switches and operating with licensed software. Our fiber-optic cable is the primary transport technology between our central offices and interconnection points with other incumbent carriers. As of December31, 2012, we maintained over 1.03million miles of copper plant and approximately 157thousand miles of fiber-optic plant in our local exchange networks. We also maintain separate networks in connection with providing fiber transport and CLEC services.
Most of our long distance service is provided through reselling arrangements with other long distance carriers, with the balance being provided directly through CenturyLink's own switches and 10 Table of Contents network equipment. All of our satellite television and wireless voice service is provided by other carriers under agency agreements.
We continue to enhance and expand our network by deploying broadband-enabled technologies to provide additional capacity to our customers. Rapid and significant changes in technology are expected to continue in the telecommunications industry. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in customer demands and technology. In particular, we anticipate that continued increases in broadband usage by our customers will require us to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity or to implement network management practices to alleviate network capacity shortages, either of which could adversely impact our results of operation and financial condition. For additional information, see "Risk Factors", generally, in Item1A of this report, and, in particular, "Risk FactorsRisks Affecting Our BusinessIncreases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for our customers." For more information, see Item2 of this report.
Regulation We are subject to significant regulation by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), which regulates interstate communications, and state utility commissions, which regulate intrastate communications in our local service area. These agencies issue rules to protect consumers and promote competition; they set the rates that telecommunication companies charge each other for exchanging traffic; and they have established USF to support the provision of services to high-cost areas. In most states, local voice service, switched and special access services and interconnection services are subject to price regulation, although the extent of regulation varies by type of service and geographic region. In addition, we are required to maintain licenses with the FCC and with the utility commissions of most of the states in our local service area. Laws and regulations in many states restrict the manner in which a licensed entity can interact with affiliates, transfer assets, issue debt and engage in other business activities, and many mergers and acquisitions require approval by the FCC and some state commissions.
Historically, incumbent local exchange carriers ("ILECs") operated as regulated monopolies having the exclusive right and responsibility to provide local telephone services in their franchised service territories. As we discuss in greater detail below, passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, coupled with state legislative and regulatory initiatives and technological change, fundamentally altered the telephone industry by generally reducing the regulation of ILECs and creating a substantial increase in the number of competitors. We are considered an ILEC. The following description discusses some of the major industry regulations that affect our traditional telephone operations, but numerous other regulations not discussed below could also impact us. Some legislation and regulations are currently the subject of judicial, legislative and administrative proceedings which could substantially change the manner in which the telecommunications industry operates and the amount of revenues we receive for our services. Neither the outcome of these proceedings, nor their potential impact on us, can be predicted at this time. For additional information, see Item1A of this annual report below.
State Regulation In recent years, most states have substantially reduced their regulation of ILECs. Nonetheless, state regulatory commissions generally continue to regulate local service rates, intrastate access charges, state universal service funds and in some cases service quality, as they continue to grant and revoke certifications authorizing companies to provide communications services. State commissions traditionally regulated pricing through "rate of return" regulation that focused on authorized levels of earnings by ILECs. Several states continue to regulate us in this manner. In most of our states, we are generally regulated under various forms of alternative regulation that typically limit our ability to increase rates for basic local voice service, but relieve us from the requirement to meet certain earnings tests. In a 11 Table of Contents few states, we have recently gained pricing freedom for the majority of retail services except for the most basic of services, such as stand-alone basic residential voice service. In most of the states in which we operate, we have gained pricing flexibility for certain enhanced calling services, such as caller identification and for bundled services that also include local voice service. State commissions periodically conduct proceedings to review the rates that we charge other telecommunications providers for using our network or for reselling our service pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
We are currently responding to carrier complaints, legislation or generic investigations regarding our intrastate switched access rates in several of our states. In particular, certain long-distance providers have disputed existing intercarrier compensation rates payable to us and other ILECs with respect to VoIP traffic or refused to pay access charges, based on the contention that tariffed switched access charges should not apply to VoIP traffic. On October27, 2011, the FCC adopted an order comprehensively reforming federal intercarrier compensation and universal service policies and rules, as discussed further below under the heading "Federal Regulation." Among other things, this order preempted state regulatory commissions' jurisdiction over all terminating access charges, including intrastate access charges that have historically been subject to exclusive state jurisdiction. Furthermore, the FCC decreed that, on a prospective basis, intercarrier compensation rates for VoIP traffic will be established at interstate access rates in the event intrastate switched access rates exceed interstate rates.
The FCC order requires all terminating access rates including intrastate, interstate and reciprocal compensation rates to be reduced and unified over time. Excluding the rate implications contemplated on a prospective basis by the recent FCC order, we will continue to vigorously defend and seek to collect our intrastate switched access revenue subject to outstanding disputes. These historical disputes are primarily over access charge compensation for VoIP traffic terminating on the public switched telephone network. The outcomes of these disputes cannot be determined at this time. If we are required to reduce our intrastate switched access rates as a result of any of these disputes or state initiatives, we will seek to recover displaced switched access revenues from state universal service funds or other services. However, the amount of such recovery, particularly from residential customers, is not assured.
Under state law, our telephone operating subsidiaries are typically governed by laws and regulations that (i)regulate the purchase and sale of ILECs, (ii)prescribe certain reporting requirements, (iii)require ILECs to provide service under publicly-filed tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices of regulated services, (iv)limit ILECs' ability to borrow and pledge their assets, (v)regulate transactions between ILECs and their affiliates, and (vi)impose various other service standards.
Unlike many of our competitors, as an ILEC we generally face "carrier of last resort" obligations which include an ongoing requirement to provide service to all prospective and current customers in our service area who request service and are willing to pay rates prescribed in our tariffs. In competitively-bid situations, such as newly-constructed housing developments or multi-tenant dwellings, this may constitute a competitive disadvantage to us if competitors can choose to focus on low-risk profitable customers and withhold service from high-risk unprofitable customers. In addition, strict adherence to carrier of last resort requirements may force us to construct facilities with a low likelihood of positive economic return.
We operate in states where traditional cost recovery mechanisms, including rate structures, are under evaluation or have been modified. There can be no assurance that these states will continue to provide for cost recovery at current levels.
Federal Regulation We are required to comply with the Communications Act of 1934, which requires us to offer services at just and reasonable rates and on non-discriminatory terms, as well as the 12 Table of Contents Telecommunications Act of 1996, which amended the Communications Act of 1934 primarily to promote competition.
The FCC regulates interstate services provided by us, including the special access charges we bill for wholesale network transmission and the interstate access charges that we bill to long-distance companies and other communications companies in connection with the origination and termination of interstate voice and data transmissions. Additionally, the FCC regulates a number of aspects of our business related to privacy, homeland security and network infrastructure, including access to and use of local telephone numbers. The FCC has responsibility for maintaining and administering the federal USF, which provides substantial support for maintaining networks in high-cost areas, as well as supporting service to low-income households, schools and libraries, and rural health care providers. Like other communications network operators, ILECs must obtain FCC approval to use certain radio frequencies, or to transfer control of any such licenses. The FCC retains the right to revoke these licenses if a carrier materially violates relevant legal requirements.
We, like other large and mid-sized ILECs, operate under price-cap regulation of interstate access rates. Under price-cap regulation, limits imposed on a company's interstate rates are adjusted periodically to reflect inflation, productivity improvement and changes in certain non-controllable costs.
In recent years, our operations and those of other telecommunications carriers have been further impacted by legislation and regulation imposing additional obligations on us, particularly with regards to providing broadband service, bolstering homeland security, increasing disaster recovery requirements, minimizing environmental impacts and enhancing privacy. These laws include the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, and laws governing local telephone number portability and customer proprietary network information requirements. These laws and regulations may cause us to incur additional costs and could impact our ability to compete effectively.
In December 2012, the FCC initiated a special access proceeding and has requested data, information and documents to allow it to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of competition in the special access market. The ultimate impact of this proceeding on the Company is currently unknown. However, if the FCC were to adopt significant changes in regulations affecting special access services, this could adversely impact our operations or financial results.
Universal Service Fund and Other Related Matters For decades, the FCC has regularly considered various intercarrier compensation reforms, generally with a goal to create a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, or carrying telecommunications traffic. In connection therewith, the FCC solicited public comments on a variety of topics related to access charges and intercarrier compensation.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act") includes certain broadband initiatives that are intended to accelerate broadband deployment across the United States. The Recovery Act approved $7.2billion in funding for broadband stimulus projects across the United States to be administered by two governmental agencies. The programs provide grants and loans to applicants for construction of certain broadband infrastructure, provision of certain broadband services, and support of certain broadband adoption initiatives. This program has attracted a wide range of applicants including states, municipalities, start-up companies and consortiums. The participation of other parties in these programs has increased competition in selected areas, which may increase our marketing costs and decrease our revenues in those areas. This trend may intensify if program participation increases.
On October27, 2011, the FCC adopted the Connect America and Intercarrier Compensation Reform order ("CAF order"), intended to reform the existing regulatory regime to recognize ongoing shifts to new technologies, including VoIP, and gradually re-direct universal service funding to foster 13 Table of Contents nationwide broadband coverage. This initial ruling provides for a multi-year transition over the next decade as terminating intercarrier compensation charges are reduced, universal service funding is explicitly targeted to broadband deployment, and line charges paid by end user customers are gradually increased. We anticipate that these changes will substantially increase the pace of reductions in the amount of switched access revenues in our wholesale segment, while creating opportunities for increases in federal USF and retail revenue streams.
On December29, 2011, the CAF order went into effect. At the same time, numerous parties filed a petition for reconsideration with the FCC seeking numerous revisions to the order. In January 2012, we joined more than two dozen parties in challenging certain aspects of the order by filing a separate appeal that is expected to be heard by the United States Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in late 2013. Future judicial challenges to the CAF order are possible, which could alter or delay the FCC's proposed changes. In addition, based on the outcome of the FCC proceedings, various state commissions may consider changes to their universal service funds or intrastate access rates. Moreover, rulemaking designed to implement the order is not complete, and several FCC proceedings relating to the order remain pending. For these and other reasons, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings at this time.
On January31, 2012, the FCC adopted an order modernizing the program that provides assistance to qualifying low-income individuals for local voice service. These changes also affect state-specific programs that provide assistance to qualifying individuals. The impact of these changes on us and our low-income customers cannot be quantified at this time, but we may face increased administrative costs, additional audit requirements and potential customer disconnections as a result of this FCC order and its implementation.
We received approximately $543million, $510million and $431million of revenue from federal and state universal service programs for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Such amounts represented approximately 3.0%, 3.3% and 6.1% of our 2012, 2011 and 2010 total operating revenues, respectively.
Other Regulations Certain of our telecommunications and data hosting services conducted in foreign countries are or may become subject to various foreign laws, including those regulating the protection and retention of data.
Competition General We compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market and we expect intense competition to continue. We compete with cable and satellite companies, wireless providers, national telecommunications providers (such as AT&T,Inc. and Verizon CommunicationsInc.) and a variety of other competitors. Technological advances, regulatory and legislative changes have increased opportunities for alternative communications service providers, which in turn have increased competitive pressures on our business. These alternate providers often face fewer regulations and have lower cost structures than we do. In addition, the telecommunications industry has experienced substantial consolidation over the past decade and some of our competitors in one or more lines of our business are generally larger, have stronger brand names, have more financial and business resources and have broader service offerings than we currently do.
Over the past decade, fundamental technological, regulatory and legislative changes have significantly impacted the communications industry, and we expect these changes will continue. Primarily as a result of regulatory and technological changes, competition has been introduced and 14 Table of Contents encouraged in each sector of the communications industry in recent years. As a result, we increasingly face competition from other communication service providers, as further described below.
Wireless telephone services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition with our ILEC services. As a result, some customers have chosen to completely forego use of traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service for voice services. We anticipate this trend will continue, particularly if wireless service providers continue to expand their coverage areas, reduce their rates, improve the quality of their services and offer enhanced new services. Substantially all of our access line customers are currently capable of receiving wireless services from at least one competitive service provider. Technological and regulatory developments in wireless services, personal communications services, digital microwave, satellite, coaxial cable, fiber-optics, local multipoint distribution services, WiFi, and other wired and wireless technologies are expected to further permit the development of alternatives to traditional landline services. Moreover, the growing prevalence of electronic mail, text messaging, social networking and similar digital communications continues to reduce the demand for traditional landline voice services.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996, which obligates ILECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the ILEC's network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition, imposes several duties on an ILEC if it receives a specific request from another entity which seeks to connect with or provide services using the ILEC's network. In addition, each ILEC is obligated to (i)negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith, (ii)provide nondiscriminatory "unbundled" access to all aspects of the ILEC's network, (iii)offer resale of its telecommunications services at wholesale rates and (iv)permit competitors, on terms and conditions (including rates) that are just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, to colocate their physical plant on the ILEC's property, or provide virtual colocation if physical colocation is not practicable. Current FCC rules require ILECs to lease a network element only in those situations where competing carriers genuinely would be impaired without access to such network elements, and where the unbundling would not interfere with the development of facilities-based competition.
As a result of these regulatory, consumer and technological developments, ILECs also face competition from competitive local exchange carriers, or CLECs, particularly in densely populated areas. CLECs provide competing services through reselling the ILECs' local services, through use of the ILECs' unbundled network elements or through their own facilities.
Technological developments have led to the development of new services that compete with traditional ILEC services. Technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide traditional circuit-switched telephone service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have aggressively pursued this opportunity. Similarly, companies providing VoIP services provide voice communication services over the Internet which compete with our traditional telephone service and our own VoIP services.
Similar to us, many cable, technology or other communications companies that previously offered a limited range of services are now offering diversified bundles of services, either through their own networks, reselling arrangements or joint ventures. As such, a growing number of companies are competing to serve the communications needs of the same customer base. Such activities will continue to place downward pressure on the demand for our access lines and the pricing of our services.
As both consumers and business customers increasingly demand high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity, we expect the demands on our network will continue to increase over the next several years. To succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can deliver services that meet these increasing bandwidth requirements. We plan to continue to invest in our network to be able to meet this future demand. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in the enterprise business.
15 Table of Contents In addition to facing direct competition from those providers described above, ILECs increasingly face competition from alternate communication systems constructed by long distance carriers, large customers or alternative access vendors. These systems are capable of originating or terminating calls without use of the ILECs' networks or switching services. Other potential sources of competition include non-carrier systems that are capable of bypassing ILECs' local networks, either partially or completely, through various means, including the provision of special access or independent switching services and the concentration of telecommunications traffic on a few of the ILECs' access lines. We anticipate that all these trends will continue and lead to decreased use of our networks.
Additional information about competitive pressures is located (i)under the heading "Risk FactorsRisks Affecting Our Business" in Item1A of this report and (ii)in the discussion immediately below, which contains more specific information on how these trends in competition have impacted our segments.
Regional Markets Strategic Services With respect to our strategic services, competition is based on price, bandwidth, service, promotions and bundled offerings. Wireless carriers' fourth generation, or 4G, services are allowing them to more directly compete with our strategic services. In reselling DIRECTV video services, we compete primarily with cable and other satellite companies as well as other sales agents and resellers. We also compete with interexchange carriers and other broadband service providers. Our Prism residential video service faces substantial competition from a variety of competitors, including well-established cable companies and companies that deliver content over the Internet and on mobile devices at little or no cost to their customers. Many of our competitors for these strategic services are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as we are and therefore they are able to avoid significant regulatory costs and obligations Our strategy is based on pricing, packaging of services and features, quality of service and meeting customer care needs and on maintaining our focus on increasing the subscribers of our broadband services. In order to remain competitive, we believe continually increasing connection speeds is important. As a result, we continue to invest in our network, which allows for the delivery of higher speed broadband services. While traditional ATM-based broadband services are declining, they have been more than offset by growth in fiber-based broadband services. We also continue to expand our product offerings including facilities-based video services and enhance our marketing efforts as we compete in a maturing market in which a significant portion of consumers already have broadband services.
Legacy Services Although our status as an ILEC continues to provide us advantages in providing local services in our local service area, as noted above we increasingly face significant competition as an increasing number of consumers are willing to substitute cable, wireless and electronic communications for traditional voice telecommunications services. This has led to an increase in the number and type of competitors within our industry and a decrease in our market share. As a result of this product substitution, we face greater competition in providing local and long distance services from wireless providers, resellers and sales agents (including ourselves), social media hosts and broadband service providers, including cable companies. We also continue to compete with traditional telecommunications providers, such as national carriers, smaller regional providers, CLECs and independent telephone companies.
Our strategy to reduce access line loss is based primarily on our pricing, packaging of services and features, quality of service and meeting customer care needs. While bundle price discounts have 16 Table of Contents resulted in lower average revenues for our individual services, we believe service bundles continue to positively impact our customer retention. In addition to our bundle discounts, we also offer limited time promotions on our broadband service for prospective customers who want our broadband service in their bundle, which further aids our ability to attract and retain customers and increase usage of our services.
Data Integration In providing data integration to our customers, we compete primarily with large integrators, equipment providers and national telecommunication providers. Competition is based on package offerings and as such we focus on providing these customers individualized and customizable packages. Our strategy is to provide our data integration through packages that include other strategic and legacy services. As such, in providing data integration we often face many of the same competitive pressures as we face in providing strategic and legacy services, as discussed above.
Wholesale Markets Strategic Services In providing private line (including special access) services to our wholesale markets customers, we compete with large cable companies, as well as other regional and national carriers, other fiber providers and CLECs. Demand for our private line services continues to increase, despite our customers' optimization of their networks, industry consolidation and technological migration. While we expect that these factors will continue to impact our wholesale markets segment, we believe the growth in fiber-based special access provided to wireless carriers for backhaul will, over time, ultimately offset the decline in copper-based special access provided to wireless carriers as they migrate to Ethernet services, although the timing and magnitude of this technological migration is uncertain.
Legacy Services The provision of our legacy services to other communications providers is highly competitive, and has been and will continue to be adversely affected by product substitution, technological migration, industry consolidation and rate reductions. We face significant competition for access services from CLECs, cable companies, resellers and wireless service providers as well as some of our own wholesale markets customers, which are deploying their own networks to provide customers with local services. By doing so, these competitors reduce traffic on our network. In addition, our long-distance revenues continue to decline as a result of customer migration to more technologically advanced services, price compression, and declining demand for traditional voice services.
Enterprise MarketsNetwork Strategic Services Our competitors for integrated data, Internet, voice services and other IT services range from mid-sized businesses to large enterprises. Due to the size and capacity of some of these companies, they may be able to offer more inexpensive solutions to our customers. To compete, we focus on providing complex, secure and performance-driven services to our business customers through our global infrastructure. Our network services continue to see pricing pressures on virtual private network and bandwidth services offset by increases in network services that support our colocation and managed hosting service offerings. Our keys to growth include targeting the right clients, offering targeted business solutions to solve specific client needs and delivering compelling and comprehensive technical capabilities.
17 Table of Contents Legacy Services We face intense competition with respect to our legacy services and continue to see customers migrating away from these services and into strategic services. In addition, our legacy services revenues have been, and we expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses and price competition.
Data Integration We expect data integration to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as this offering tends to be more sensitive than others to changes in the economy and in spending trends of our federal government customers. In addition, changes to our compensation programs, which focus on higher margin strategic services, could negatively impact data integration revenues.
Enterprise MarketsData Hosting Strategic Services Our competitors for hosting, colocation and other IT services include telecommunications companies, hardware manufacturers and system integrators that support the in-house IT operations for a business or offer outsourcing solutions. Due to the size and capacity of some of these companies, they may be able to offer more inexpensive solutions to our customers. To compete, we focus on providing complex, secure and performance-driven services to our business customers through our global infrastructure on the same terms outlined under the heading "BusinessEnterprise MarketsNetworkStrategic Services" in ItemI of this report.
For our colocation services, we continue to see pricing pressures with respect to these services as low-cost wholesale colocation providers continue to enter our market, and we expect this trend to continue. Our services can be purchased individually or as part of a total outsourcing arrangement.
Environmental Compliance Several decades ago one of our subsidiaries acquired entities that may have owned or operated seven former "manufactured gas" plant sites that may require environmental remediation. From time to time we may incur other environmental compliance and remediation expenses, mainly resulting from the ownership of other prior industrial sites or the operation of vehicle fleets or power supplies for our communications equipment. Although we cannot assess with certainty the impact of any future compliance and remediation obligations or provide you with any assurances regarding the ultimate impact thereof, we do not believe that future environmental compliance and remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Seasonality Overall, our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality. From time to time weather related problems have resulted in increased costs to repair our network and respond to service calls in some of our markets. The amount and timing of these costs are subject to the weather patterns of any given year, but have generally been highest during the third quarter and have been related to damage from severe storms, including hurricanes, tropical storms and tornadoes in our markets along the lower Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastlines.
Employees At December31, 2012, we had approximately 47,000 employees, of which approximately 18,000 are members of either the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ("IBEW") or the Communications Workers of America ("CWA"). Approximately 12,000 of these employees are subject 18 Table of Contents to collective bargaining agreements that expired October6, 2012. We are currently negotiating the terms of new agreements. In the meantime, the predecessor agreements have been extended, and the unions have agreed to provide at least twenty-four hour advance notice before terminating those predecessor agreements. See the discussion of risks relating to our labor relations in "Risk FactorsRisks Affecting Our Business" in Item1A of this report.
Over the past several years, we have reduced our workforce primarily due to (i)integration efforts from our recent acquisitions; (ii)increased competitive pressures; and (iii)the loss of access lines.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us.
21 Table of Contents Please be aware that additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial could also materially and adversely affect our business operations.
Risks Affecting Our Business Increasing competition, including product substitution, continues to cause access line losses, which has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
We compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market, and we expect competition to continue to intensify. In addition to competition from larger national telecommunications providers, we are facing increasing competition from a variety of other sources, including cable and satellite companies, wireless providers, broadband companies, resellers, sales agents and facilities-based providers using their own networks as well as those leasing parts of our network. In addition, regulatory developments over the past several years have generally increased competitive pressures on our business. Due to some of these and other factors, we continue to lose access lines.
Some of our current and potential competitors (i)offer a more comprehensive range of communications products and services, (ii)have market presence, engineering and technical capabilities, and financial and other resources greater than ours, (iii)own larger or more diverse networks with greater transmission capacity or other advantages, (iv)conduct operations or raise capital at a lower cost than us, (v)are subject to less regulation, (vi)offer greater online content or (vii)have substantially stronger brand names. Consequently, these competitors may be better equipped to provide more attractive offerings, to charge lower prices for their products and services, to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly, to adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, and to devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services.
Competition could adversely impact us in several ways, including (i)the loss of customers and market share, (ii)the possibility of customers reducing their usage of our services or shifting to less profitable services, (iii)reduced traffic on our networks, (iv)our need to expend substantial time or money on new capital improvement projects, (v)our need to lower prices or increase marketing expenses to remain competitive and (vi)our inability to diversify by successfully offering new products or services.
We are continually taking steps to respond to these competitive pressures, but these efforts may not be successful. Our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected if these initiatives are unsuccessful or insufficient and if we otherwise are unable to sufficiently stem or offset our continuing access line losses and our revenue declines significantly without corresponding cost reductions. If this occurred, our ability to service debt and pay other obligations would also be adversely affected.
Rapid changes in technology and markets could require substantial expenditure of financial and other resources in excess of contemplated levels, and any inability to respond to those changes could reduce our market share and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
The communications industry is experiencing significant technological changes, many of which are reducing demand for our traditional voice services or are enabling our current customers to reduce or bypass use of our networks. Similarly, the information technology services industry is experiencing rapid changes in technologies. Further technological change could require us to expend capital or other resources in excess of currently contemplated levels, or to forgo the development or provision of products or services that others can provide more efficiently. If we are not able to develop new products and services to keep pace with technological advances, or if those products and services are not widely accepted by customers, our ability to compete could be adversely affected and our market share could decline. Any inability to effectively respond to changes in technology and markets could 22 Table of Contents also adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to service debt and pay other obligations.
For additional information on the risks of increased expenditures, see "Risk FactorsRisks Affecting our Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur business requires us to incur substantial capital and operating expenses, which reduces our available free cash flow." Our legacy services continue to experience declining revenues, and our efforts to offset these declines may not be successful.
The telephone industry has experienced a decline in access lines and network access revenues, which, coupled with the other changes resulting from competitive, technological and regulatory developments, continue to place downward pressure on the revenues we generate from our legacy services.
We have taken a variety of steps to counter these declines, including:  an increased focus on selling a broader range of higher-growth strategic services, which are described in detail in Item1 and 7 of this report;  an increased focus on serving a broader range of business, governmental and wholesale customers;  greater use of service bundles; and  acquisitions to increase our scale and strengthen our product offerings, including new products and services provided by our Savvis operations.
However, some of these strategic services generate lower profit margins than our traditional services, and some can be expected to experience slowing growth as increasing numbers of our existing or potential customers subscribe to these newer products. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the revenues generated from our new offerings will offset revenue losses associated from reduced sales of our legacy products. Similarly, we cannot assure you that our new service offerings will be as successful as anticipated, or that we will be able to continue to grow through acquisitions. In addition, our reliance on third parties to provide certain of these strategic services could constrain our flexibility, as described further below.
If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, our business and operating results could be materially harmed.
Over 38% of our employees are members of various bargaining units represented by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Approximately 12,000, or 26%, of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements that expired October6, 2012. We are currently negotiating the terms of new agreements. In the meantime, the predecessor agreements have been extended, and the applicable unions have agreed to provide us with at least twenty-four hour advance notice before terminating those predecessor agreements.
We may be unable to reach new agreements, and union employees may engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and result in increased cost to us. In addition, new labor agreements may impose significant new costs on us, which could impair our financial condition or results of operations in the future. To the extent they contain benefit provisions, these agreements may also limit our flexibility to change benefits in response to industry or competitive changes. In particular, the post-employment benefits provided under these agreements could cause us to incur costs not faced by many of our competitors, which could ultimately hinder our competitive position.
23 Table of Contents Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively adjust to changes in our business, and will further suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations.
The above-described changes in our industry have placed a higher premium on marketing, technological, engineering and provisioning skills. Our recent acquisitions also significantly changed the composition of our markets and product mix. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to retrain our staff to acquire or strengthen skills necessary to address these changes, and, where necessary, to attract and retain new personnel that possess these skills.
Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
Unfavorable general economic conditions, including the unstable economy and credit market, could negatively affect our business. Worldwide economic growth has been sluggish since 2008, and many experts believe that a confluence of factors in the United States, Europe, Asia and developing countries may result in a prolonged period of economic downturn, slow growth or economic uncertainty. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of these general economic conditions, they could adversely affect the affordability of and consumer demand for some of our products and services and could cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of our products and services. These conditions impact, in particular, our ability to sell discretionary products or services to business customers that are under pressure to reduce costs or to governmental customers that have suffered recent budget cuts. Any one or more of these circumstances could cause our revenues to continue declining. Also, our customers may encounter financial hardships or may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could negatively impact their ability to make timely payments to us. In addition, as discussed further below, unstable economic and credit markets may preclude us from refinancing maturing debt at terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously benefited, at terms that are acceptable to us or at all. For these reasons, among others, if the current economic conditions persist or decline, this could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to raise capital.
We could be harmed by security breaches, damages or other significant disruptions or failures of our networks, IT infrastructure or related systems, or of those we operate for certain of our customers.
To be successful, we will need to continue providing our customers with a high-capacity, reliable and secure network. We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach or significant disruption of our IT infrastructure and related systems (including our billing systems). As a communications and IT company, we face an added risk that a security breach or other significant disruption of our public networks or IT infrastructure and related systems that we develop, install, operate and maintain for certain of our business and governmental customers could lead to material interruptions or curtailments of service. Moreover, due to the nature of our customers and services, we face a heightened risk that a security breach or disruption could result in unauthorized access to our customers' proprietary or classified information on our public networks or internal systems or the systems that we operate and maintain for certain of our customers.
We make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and systems and maintain contingency plans in the event of security breaches or other system disruptions. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that our security efforts and measures will prevent unauthorized access to our systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, malware, or other forms of cyber attacks or similar events. These threats may derive from human error, fraud, malice or sabotage on the part of employees, third parties or other nations, or could result from accidental technological failure. Similar to other large telecommunications companies, we have been subject to a variety of security breaches and cyber attacks, although to date none of these have resulted in a material adverse effect on our 24 Table of Contents operating results or financial condition. We cannot assure you, however, that future security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging, especially in light of the growing frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks and intrusions. We may be unable to anticipate all potential types of attacks or intrusions or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and any resulting damages could be material.
Additional risks to our network and infrastructure include:  power losses or physical damage, whether caused by fire, adverse weather conditions, terrorism or otherwise;  capacity limitations;  software and hardware defects or malfunctions;  programming, processing and other human error; and  other disruptions that are beyond our control.
Network disruptions, security breaches and other significant failures of the above-described systems could:  disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore our operations or those of certain of our customers;  result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours, our customers or our customers' end-users, including trade secrets, which others could use for competitive, disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;  require significant management attention or financial resources to remedy the damages that result or to change our systems, including expenses to repair systems, add new personnel or develop additional protective systems;  subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, fines, penalties, termination or other remedies, particularly with respect to service standards set by state regulatory commissions; or  result in a loss of business, damage our reputation among our customers and the public generally, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to litigation.
Likewise, our ability to expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs is important to the continued implementation of our new service offering initiatives. Our inability to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, which could include the delayed implementation of new service offerings, increased acquisition integration costs, service or billing interruptions, and the diversion of development resources.
Any or all of the foregoing developments could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Increases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for our customers.
Video streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional Internet activity such as web browsing and email. As utilization rates and availability of these services continue to grow, our high-speed Internet customers may use much more bandwidth than in the past. If this occurs, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower 25 Table of Contents transmission speeds for our customers. Alternatively, we could choose to implement network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in market areas experiencing congestion, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and attract customers in affected markets. While we believe demand for these services may drive high-speed Internet customers to pay for faster broadband speeds, we may not be able to recover the costs of the necessary network investments. This could result in an adverse impact to our operating margins, results of operations and financial condition.
We may need to defend ourselves against claims that we infringe upon others' intellectual property rights, or we may need to seek third-party licenses to expand our product offerings.
From time to time, we receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits filed by third parties claiming we have infringed or are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. We may receive similar notices or be involved in similar lawsuits in the future. Responding to these claims may require us to expend significant time and money defending our use of affected technology, may require us to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments that we would not otherwise have to pay or may require us to pay damages. If we are required to take one or more of these actions, our profit margins may decline. In addition, in responding to these claims, we may be required to stop selling or redesign one or more of our products or services, which could significantly and adversely affect the way we conduct business.
Similarly, from time to time, we may need to obtain the right to use certain patents or other intellectual property from third parties to be able to offer new products and services. If we cannot license or otherwise obtain rights to use any required technology from a third party on reasonable terms, our ability to offer new products and services may be restricted, made more costly or delayed.
Our reseller and sales agency arrangements expose us to a number of risks, one or more of which may adversely affect our business and operating results.
We rely on reseller and sales agency arrangements with other companies to provide some of the services that we sell to our customers, including video services and wireless products and services. If we fail to extend or renegotiate these arrangements as they expire from time to time or if these other companies fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us or our customers, we may have difficulty finding alternative arrangements and our customers may experience disruptions to their services. In addition, as a reseller or sales agent, we do not control the availability, retail price, design, function, quality, reliability, customer service or branding of these products and services, nor do we directly control all of the marketing and promotion of these products and services. To the extent that these other companies make decisions that negatively impact our ability to market and sell their products and services, our business plans and goals and our reputation could be negatively impacted. If these reseller and sales agency arrangements are unsuccessful due to one or more of these risks, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.
Consolidation among other participants in the telecommunications industry may allow our competitors to compete more effectively against us, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
The telecommunications industry has experienced substantial consolidation over the last couple of decades, and some of our competitors have combined with other telecommunications providers, resulting in larger competitors that have greater financial and business resources and broader service offerings. Further consolidation could increase competitive pressures, and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to service debt and pay other obligations.
26 Table of Contents We have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings and reduce our stockholders' equity.
Under generally accepted accounting principles, intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. If our intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we may be required to record a significant, non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue paying dividends at the current rate.
Decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to make any future dividend distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of our Board of Directors, which reserves the right to change or terminate our dividend practices at any time and for any reason. Based on current circumstances, we plan to continue our current dividend practices. However, you should be aware that these practices are reviewed periodically and are subject to change for reasons that may include any of the following factors:  we may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to changes in our cash requirements, capital spending plans, stock purchase plans, cash flows or financial position;  the effects of regulatory reform, including any changes to intercarrier compensation, Universal Service Fund or special access rules;  our desire to maintain or improve the credit ratings on our debt;  the amount of dividends that we may distribute to our shareholders is subject to restrictions under Louisiana law and is limited by restricted payment and leverage covenants in our credit facilities and, potentially, the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur; and  the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may distribute to us is subject to restrictions imposed by state law, restrictions that have been or may be imposed by state regulators in connection with obtaining necessary approvals for our acquisitions, and restrictions imposed by the terms of credit facilities applicable to certain subsidiaries and, potentially, the terms of any future indebtedness that these subsidiaries may incur.
Our Board of Directors is free to change or suspend our dividend practices at any time. Our common shareholders should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to dividends.
Our current dividend practices could limit our ability to pursue growth opportunities, repurchase stock or retire debt.
The current practice of our Board of Directors to continue to pay common share dividends in accordance with past practices reflects an intention to distribute to our shareholders a substantial portion of our cash flow. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to apply to other transactions that could be beneficial to our shareholders or debtholders, including stock buybacks, debt prepayments or capital expenditures that strengthen our business. In addition, our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business through acquisitions or increased capital spending will depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third party financing. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us at terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously benefited, at terms that are acceptable to us or at all.
27 Table of Contents We rely on a limited number of key suppliers, vendors, landlords and other third parties to operate our business, as well as a limited number of financial institutions to fund our revolving credit requirements.
We depend on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure. Our local exchange carrier networks consist of central office and remote sites, all with advanced digital switches. If any of these suppliers experience interruptions or other problems delivering or servicing these network components on a timely basis, our operations could suffer significantly. To the extent that proprietary technology of a supplier is an integral component of our network, we may have limited flexibility to purchase key network components from alternative suppliers. Similarly, our data center operations are materially reliant on leasing significant amounts of space from landlords and substantial amounts of power from utility companies, and being able to renew these arrangements from time to time on favorable terms. In addition, we rely on a limited number of software vendors to support our business management systems. In the event it becomes necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement supplies, services, space or utilities on economically attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs or cause disruptions in our services.
We rely on eighteen financial institutions to provide us with access to revolving credit under our credit facility. If one or more of these lenders default on their funding commitments, our access to revolving credit could be adversely affected.
Portions of our property, plant and equipment are located on property owned by third parties.
Over the past few years, certain utilities, cooperatives and municipalities in certain of the states in which we operate have requested significant rate increases for attaching our plant to their facilities. To the extent that these entities are successful in increasing the amount we pay for these attachments, our future operating costs will increase.
In addition, we rely on rights-of-way, colocation agreements and other authorizations granted by governmental bodies and other third parties to locate our cable, conduit and other network equipment on their respective properties. If any of these authorizations terminate or lapse, our operations could be adversely affected.
We depend on key members of our senior management team.
Our success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of a limited number of senior officers. Competition for senior management in our industry is intense and we may have difficulty retaining our current senior officers or attracting new ones in the event of terminations or resignations. For a discussion of similar retention concerns relating to our recent mergers, please see the risks described below under the heading "Risk FactorsRisks Relating to our Recent Acquisitions." As a holding company, we rely on payments from our operating companies to meet our obligations.
As a holding company, substantially all of our income and operating cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and their distribution of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans or other payments. As a result, we rely upon our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations, including the payment of amounts owed under our long-term debt. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts owed by us or, subject to limited exceptions for tax-sharing or cash management purposes, to make any funds available to us to repay our obligations, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. All of our subsidiaries are subject to state law restrictions that limit the amount of dividends they can pay to us. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may be restricted under loan agreements or regulatory orders from transferring funds to us, including certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be 28 Table of Contents paid to us. Moreover, our rights to receive assets of any subsidiary upon its liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors of that subsidiary, including trade creditors. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources" in Item7 of this report, for further discussion on these matters.
Risks Relating to our Recent Acquisitions We expect to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Qwest and Savvis.
We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial expenses in connection with the integration of Qwest's and Savvis' business, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures with our own. There are a large number of systems that need to be integrated, including billing, management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll and benefits, fixed asset, lease administration and regulatory compliance. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses will be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of our integration expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time.
We may be unable to integrate successfully into Legacy CenturyLink our recently-acquired operations and realize the anticipated benefits of our recent acquisitions.
Our recent acquisitions involved the combination of companies which previously operated as independent public companies. We have devoted, and will continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Legacy CenturyLink, Qwest and Savvis. We may encounter difficulties in the integration process, including the following:  the inability to successfully combine our businesses in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the acquisitions, either due to technological challenges, personnel shortages, strikes or otherwise, any of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame anticipated or at all;  lost sales as a result of customers deciding not to do business with the combined company;  the complexities associated with managing the combined businesses out of several different locations and integrating personnel from multiple companies, while at the same time attempting to provide consistent, high-quality products and services under a unified culture;  the additional complexities of combining companies with different histories, regulatory restrictions, sales forces, marketing strategies, product markets and customer bases;  the failure to retain key employees, some of whom could be critical to integrating or expanding the companies;  potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or regulatory conditions associated with the acquisitions; and  performance shortfalls at one or all of the companies as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by integrating the companies' operations.
For all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our products, services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the 29 Table of Contents anticipated benefits of our recent acquisitions, or could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.
The Qwest and Embarq acquisitions changed the profile of our local exchange markets to include more large urban areas, with which we have limited operating experience.
Prior to our acquisition of Embarq Corporation ("Embarq"), we provided local exchange telephone services to predominantly rural areas and small to mid-size cities. Embarq's local exchange markets included Las Vegas, Nevada and suburbs of Orlando and several other large U.S. cities, and we have operated these more dense markets only since mid-2009. Qwest's markets included Phoenix, Arizona, Denver, Colorado, MinneapolisSt.Paul, Minnesota, Seattle, Washington, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Portland, Oregon. Compared to our legacy markets, these urban markets, on average, are substantially denser and experienced greater access line losses prior to being acquired by us. While we believe our strategies and operating models developed serving rural and smaller markets can successfully be applied to larger markets, we cannot assure you of this. Our business, financial performance and prospects could be harmed if our current strategies or operating models cannot be successfully applied to larger markets, or are required to be changed or abandoned to adjust to differences in these larger markets.
We cannot assure you whether, when or in what amounts we will be able to use Qwest's net operating losses.
At December31, 2012, we had approximately $4.7billion of federal net operating losses, or NOLs, which relate primarily to pre-acquisition losses of Qwest. These NOLs can be used to offset our future federal and certain taxable income.
The acquisition of Qwest caused an "ownership change" under federal tax laws relating to the use of NOLs. As a result, these laws could limit our ability to use their NOLs and certain other deferred tax attributes. Further limitations could apply if we are deemed to undergo an ownership change in the future. Despite this, we expect to use substantially all of these NOLs and certain other deferred tax attributes as an offset to our federal future taxable income by 2015, although the timing of that use will depend upon the consolidated group's future earnings and future tax circumstances.
Our acquisitions have increased our exposure to the risks of fluctuations in energy costs, power outages and availability of electrical resources.
Through the acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis, we have added a significant number of data center facilities, which are susceptible to regional costs and supply of power and electrical power outages. We attempt to limit exposure to system downtime by using backup generators and power supplies. However, we may not be able to limit our exposure entirely even with these protections in place. In addition, our energy costs can fluctuate significantly or increase for a variety of reasons, including changes in legislation and regulation. Several pending proposals designed to reduce greenhouse emissions could substantially increase our energy costs. As energy costs increase, we may not always be able to pass on the increased costs of energy to our clients, which could harm our business. Power and cooling requirements at our data centers are also increasing as a result of the increasing power demands of today's servers. Since we rely on third parties to provide our data centers with power sufficient to meet our clients' power needs, our data centers could have a limited or inadequate amount of electrical resources. Our clients' demand for power may also exceed the power capacity in older data centers, which may limit our ability to fully utilize these data centers. This could adversely affect our relationships with our clients and hinder our ability to run our data centers, which could harm our business.
30 Table of Contents Our inability to renew data center leases, or renew on favorable terms, could have a negative impact on our financial results.
A significant majority of the data centers we acquired in the Qwest and Savvis acquisitions are leased and have lease terms that expire between 2013 and 2031. The majority of these leases provide us with the opportunity to renew the lease at our option for periods generally ranging from five to ten years. Many of these renewal options, however, provide that rent for the renewal period will be equal to the fair market rental rate at the time of renewal. If the fair market rental rates are significantly higher than our current rental rates, we may be unable to offset these costs by charging more for our services, which could have a negative impact on our financial results. Also, it is possible that a landlord may insist on other financially unfavorable renewal terms or, where no further option to renew exists, elect not to renew altogether.
Our acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis have increased our exposure to the risks of operating internationally.
Prior to acquiring Qwest on April1, 2011, substantially all of our operations were historically conducted within the continental United States. Although Qwest has historically conducted some operations overseas, the acquisition of Savvis on July15, 2011, increased the importance of international operations to our future operations, growth and prospects.
As a result of our recent acquisitions, our foreign operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which we provide services. Local laws and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement, differ significantly among those jurisdictions, and can change significantly over time. Future regulatory, judicial and legislative changes or interpretations may have a material adverse effect on our ability to deliver services within various foreign jurisdictions. Many of these foreign laws and regulations relating to communications services are more restrictive than U.S. laws and regulations, particularly those relating to content distributed over the Internet. For example, the European Union has enacted a data retention system that, once implemented by individual member states, will involve requirements to retain certain Internet protocol, or IP, data that could have an impact on our operations in Europe. Moreover, national regulatory frameworks that are consistent with the policies and requirements of the World Trade Organization have only recently been, or are still being, enacted in many countries. Accordingly, many countries are still in the early stages of providing for and adapting to a liberalized telecommunications market. As a result, in these markets we may encounter more protracted and difficult procedures to obtain licenses necessary to provide the full set of products we offer.
In addition to these international regulatory risks, some of the other risks inherent in conducting business internationally include:  tax, licensing, currency, political or other business restrictions or requirements;  import and export restrictions;  longer payment cycles and problems collecting accounts receivable;  additional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, as well as other anti-corruption laws;  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  the ability to secure and maintain the necessary physical and telecommunications infrastructure; and  challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations.
Any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our international operations.
31 Table of Contents Moreover, in order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, it is frequently necessary or required to establish joint ventures, strategic alliances or marketing arrangements with local operators, partners or agents. Reliance on local operators, partners or agents could expose us to the risk of being unable to control the scope or quality of our overseas services or products, or being held liable under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws for actions taken by our strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subject to the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation or prospects.
Any additional future acquisitions by us would subject us to additional business, operating and financial risks, the impact of which cannot presently be evaluated, and could adversely impact our capital structure or financial position.
From time to time in the future we may pursue other acquisition opportunities. To the extent we acquire a business that is highly leveraged or is otherwise subject to a high level of risk, we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that business. Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular business or assets that we may acquire. In addition, the financing of any future acquisition completed by us could adversely impact our capital structure or financial position, as any such financing would likely include the issuance of additional securities or the borrowing of additional funds. Except as required by law or applicable securities exchange listing standards, we do not expect to ask our shareholders to vote on any proposed acquisition. Moreover, we generally do not announce our acquisitions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement.
Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters Any adverse outcome of the KPNQwest litigation, or other material litigation of Qwest, Savvis or CenturyLink could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results, on the trading price of our securities and on our ability to access the capital markets.
As described in Note15Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report, the KPNQwest matters present material and significant risks to us. In the aggregate, the plaintiffs in the KPNQwest matters seek billions of dollars in damages. We continue to defend against these matters vigorously and are currently unable to provide any estimate as to the timing of their resolution.
We can give no assurance as to the impacts on our financial results or financial condition that may ultimately result from these matters. The ultimate outcomes of these matters are still uncertain, and substantial settlements or judgments in these matters could have a significant impact on us. The magnitude of such settlements or judgments resulting from these matters could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to meet our debt obligations, potentially impacting our credit ratings, our ability to access capital markets and our compliance with debt covenants. In addition, the magnitude of any such settlements or judgments may cause us to draw down significantly on our cash balances, which might force us to obtain additional financing or explore other methods to generate cash. Such methods could include issuing additional debt securities or selling assets.
There are other material proceedings pending against us, as described in the above-referenced Note15. Depending on their outcome, any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operating results. We can give you no assurances as to the impact of these matters on our operating results or financial condition.
32 Table of Contents We operate in a highly regulated industry and are therefore exposed to restrictions on our manner of doing business and a variety of claims relating to such regulation.
General.
We are subject to significant regulation by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), which regulates interstate communications, and state utility commissions, which regulate intrastate communications. Generally, we must obtain and maintain certificates of authority from the FCC and regulatory bodies in most states where we offer regulated services, and we are subject to numerous, and often quite detailed, requirements and interpretations under federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that we are always considered to be in compliance with all these requirements at any single point in time. The agencies responsible for the enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations may initiate inquiries or actions based on customer complaints or on their own initiative.
Regulation of the telecommunications industry continues to change rapidly, and the regulatory environment varies substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Notwithstanding a recent movement towards alternative regulation, a substantial portion of our local voice services revenue remains subject to FCC and state utility commission pricing regulation, which periodically exposes us to pricing or earnings disputes and could expose us to unanticipated price declines. Interexchange carriers have filed complaints in various forums requesting reductions in our access rates. In addition, several long distance providers are disputing amounts owed to us for carrying VoIP traffic, or traffic they claim to be VoIP traffic, and are refusing to pay such amounts. There can be no assurance that future regulatory, judicial or legislative activities will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, or that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations.
Risks associated with recent changes in federal regulation.
On October27, 2011, the FCC adopted the Connect America and Intercarrier Compensation Reform order ("CAF order") intended to reform the existing regulatory regime to recognize ongoing shifts to new technologies, including VoIP, and gradually re-direct universal service funding to foster nationwide broadband coverage. This initial ruling provides for a multi-year transition over the next decade as intercarrier compensation charges are reduced, universal service funding is explicitly targeted to broadband deployment, and subscriber line charges paid by end user customers are gradually increased. We expect these changes will substantially increase the pace of reductions in the amount of switched access revenues we receive in our wholesale markets segment, while creating opportunities for increases in federal USF and retail revenue streams. Several judicial challenges to the CAF order are pending and additional future challenges are possible, any of which could alter or delay the FCC's proposed changes. In addition, based on the outcome of the FCC proceedings, various state commissions may consider changes to their universal service funds or intrastate access rates. Moreover, rulemaking designed to implement the order is not complete, and several FCC proceedings relating to the order remain pending. For these and other reasons, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings at this time.
In addition, during the last few years Congress or the FCC has initiated various other changes, including (i)broadband stimulus projects, support funds and similar plans and (ii)new "network neutrality" rules. The FCC is also considering changes in the regulation of special access services. Any of these recent or pending initiatives could adversely affect our operations or financial results.
Risks posed by costs of regulatory compliance.
Regulations continue to create significant compliance costs for us. Challenges to our tariffs by regulators or third parties or delays in obtaining certifications and regulatory approvals could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses, and, if successful, such challenges could adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge our customers. Our business also may be impacted by legislation and regulation imposing new or greater obligations related to regulations or laws related to broadband deployment, bolstering homeland security, increasing disaster recovery requirements, minimizing environmental impacts, 33 Table of Contents enhancing privacy, or addressing other issues that impact our business, including the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (which requires communications carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities, and services are able to facilitate authorized electronic surveillance), and laws governing local number portability and customer proprietary network information requirements. We expect our compliance costs to increase if future laws or regulations continue to increase our obligations to assist other governmental agencies.
Risks posed by other regulations.
All of our operations are also subject to a variety of environmental, safety, health and other governmental regulations. We monitor our compliance with federal, state and local regulations governing the management, discharge and disposal of hazardous and environmentally sensitive materials. Although we believe that we are in compliance with these regulations, our management, discharge or disposal of hazardous and environmentally sensitive materials might expose us to claims or actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
Regulatory changes in the communications industry could adversely affect our business by facilitating greater competition against us.
For over 15years, Congress and the FCC have taken several steps that have resulted in increased competition among communications service providers. Many of the FCC's regulations remain subject to judicial review and additional rulemakings, thus making it difficult to determine the ultimate impact of these changes on us and our competitors.
"Net neutrality" legislation or regulation could limit our ability to operate our high-speed data business profitably and to manage our broadband facilities efficiently .
In order to continue to provide quality high-speed data service at attractive prices, we believe we need the continued flexibility to respond to changing consumer demands, to manage bandwidth usage efficiently and to invest in our networks. The FCC's "net neutrality" regulations could adversely impact our ability to operate our high-speed data network profitably and to undertake the upgrades and implement network management practices that may be needed to continue to provide high quality high-speed data services, and could therefore negatively impact our ability to compete effectively.
We may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our network.
The law relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on, stored or disseminated through their networks is still unsettled. As such, we could be exposed to legal claims relating to content disseminated on our networks. Claims could challenge the accuracy of materials on our network, or could involve matters such as defamation, invasion of privacy or copyright infringement. If we need to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks, or are required to defend ourselves against such claims, our financial results could be negatively affected.
We are subject to significant regulations that limit our flexibility.
As a diversified full service ILEC in most of our key markets, we have traditionally been subject to significant regulation that does not apply to many of our competitors. This regulation imposes substantial compliance costs on us and restricts our ability to change rates, to compete and to respond rapidly to changing industry conditions. As our business becomes increasingly competitive, regulatory disparities between us and our competitors could impede our ability to compete.
We are subject to franchising requirements that could impede our expansion opportunities.
We may be required to obtain from municipal authorities operating franchises to install or expand facilities. Some of these franchises may require us to pay franchise fees. These franchising requirements 34 Table of Contents generally apply to our fiber transport and CLEC operations, and to our facilities-based video services. These requirements could delay us in expanding our operations or increase the costs of providing these services.
We are exposed to risks arising out of recent legislation affecting U.S. public companies.
Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and related regulations implemented thereunder, are increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. Any failure to successfully or timely complete annual assessments of our internal controls required by Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or investors' confidence in us.
For a more thorough discussion of the regulatory issues that may affect our business, see "Regulation" in Item1of this report.
Risks Affecting our Liquidity and Capital Resources Our high debt levels pose risks to our viability and may make us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions, as well as other adverse developments.
We continue to carry significant debt. As of December31, 2012, our consolidated debt was approximately $20.6billion. Approximately $2.1billion of our debt securities come due over the next thirty-six months. While we currently believe that we will have the financial resources to meet or refinance our obligations when they come due, we cannot fully anticipate our future financial condition or the condition of the credit markets or the economy. We may incur unexpected expenses or liabilities, and we may have limited access to financing.
Our significant levels of debt can adversely affect us in several other respects, including (i)limiting our ability to access the capital markets, (ii)exposing us to the risk of credit rating downgrades, which would raise our borrowing costs and could further limit our access to capital, (iii)hindering our flexibility to plan for or react to changing market, industry or economic conditions, (iv)limiting the amount of cash flow available for future operations, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases or other uses, (v)making us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest rate increases, and (vi)placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors.
The effects of each of these factors could be intensified if we borrow more cash. We expect to periodically require financing to meet our debt obligations as they come due. Due to the unstable economy and credit market, we may not be able to refinance maturing debt at terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously benefited, at terms that are acceptable to us or at all. We may also need to obtain additional financing or investigate other methods to generate cash (such as further cost reductions or the sale of assets) under a variety of circumstances, including if revenues and cash provided by operations decline, if economic conditions weaken, if competitive pressures increase, if regulatory requirements change, if we are required to contribute a material amount of cash to our pension plans, if we are required to begin to pay other post-retirement benefits significantly earlier than anticipated, if our payments for federal taxes increase faster or in greater amounts than currently anticipated, if we become subject to significant judgments or settlements in one or more of the matters discussed in Note15Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report, if we engage in any acquisitions or if we undertake substantial capital projects or other initiatives that increase our cash requirements. We can give no assurance that this additional financing will be available on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If we are able to obtain additional financing, our credit ratings could be adversely affected, which could further raise our 35 Table of Contents borrowing costs and further limit our future access to capital and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.
Certain of our debt instruments have cross payment default or cross acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. Any such event could adversely affect our ability to conduct business or access the capital markets and could adversely impact our credit ratings. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources" in Item7 of this report for additional information about our credit facility.
Our debt agreements and the debt agreements of our subsidiaries allow us to incur significantly more debt, which could exacerbate the other risks described in this report.
The terms of our debt instruments and the debt instruments of our subsidiaries permit additional indebtedness. Additional debt may be necessary for many reasons, including those discussed immediately above. Incremental borrowings on terms that impose additional financial risks could exacerbate the other risks described in this report.
Our business requires us to incur substantial capital and operating expenses, which reduce our available free cash flow.
Our business is capital intensive, and we anticipate that our capital requirements will continue to be significant in the coming years. As discussed further under "Risk FactorsRisks Affecting Our BusinessIncreases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for our customers," increased bandwidth consumption by consumers and businesses have placed increased demands on the transmission capacity of our networks. If we determine that our networks must be expanded to handle these increased demands, we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures, even though there is no assurance that the return on our investment will be satisfactory. In addition, many of our growth initiatives are capital intensive and changes in technology could require further spending. In addition to investing in expanded networks, new products or new technologies, we must from time to time replace some of the equipment that supports our traditional services as that equipment ages, even though the revenue base from those services is not growing. While we believe that our planned level of capital expenditures will meet both our maintenance and core growth requirements, this may not be the case if demands on our network continue to accelerate or other circumstances underlying our expectations change. Increased spending could, among other things, adversely affect our operating margins, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.
Similarly, we continue to anticipate incurring substantial operating expenses to support our incumbent services and growth initiatives. Although we have successfully reduced our operating expenses over the past few years, we may be unable to further reduce these costs, even if revenues in some of our lines of business are decreasing. If so, our operating margins will be adversely impacted.
Adverse changes in the value of assets or obligations associated with our qualified pension plans could negatively impact our liquidity.
The funded status of our qualified pension plans is the difference between the value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The accounting unfunded status of our qualified pension plans was $2.5billion as of December31, 2012. Adverse changes in interest rates or market conditions, among other assumptions and factors, could cause a significant increase in our benefit obligation or a significant decrease in the value of plan assets. These adverse changes could require us to contribute a material amount of cash to our pension plans or could accelerate the timing of required cash payments. For information on the amount of cash we propose to contribute to our plans in the near term, please 36 Table of Contents see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesPension and Post-retirement Benefit Obligations" in Item7 of this report. The actual amount of required contributions to our plans in 2014 and beyond will depend on a variety of factors, including earnings on plan investments, prevailing interest and discount rates, demographic experience, changes in plans benefits and changes in funding laws and regulations. Any future material cash contributions could have a negative impact on our liquidity by reducing our cash flows.
We plan to access the public debt markets, and we cannot assure you that these markets will remain free of disruptions.
We have a significant amount of indebtedness that we intend to refinance over the next several years, principally through the issuance of debt securities of CenturyLink, Qwest Corporation or both. Our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position, performance, and credit ratings, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Prevailing market conditions could be adversely affected by the ongoing disruptions in the European sovereign debt markets, the failure of the United States to reduce its deficit in amounts deemed to be sufficient, possible further downgrades in the credit ratings of the U.S. debt, contractions or limited growth in the economy or other similar adverse economic developments in the U.S. or abroad. Instability in the global financial markets has from time to time resulted in periodic volatility in the capital markets. This volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Any such failure to obtain additional financing could jeopardize our ability to repay, refinance or reduce debt obligations.
Other Risks If conditions or assumptions differ from the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies, the accuracy of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures could be affected.
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which are described in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in Item7 of this report, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that are considered "critical" because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events or assumptions differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, these events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
We face hurricane and other natural disaster risks, which can disrupt our operations and cause us to incur substantial additional capital and operating costs.
A substantial number of our facilities are located in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina and other coastal states, which subjects them to the risks associated with severe tropical storms, hurricanes and tornadoes, including downed telephone lines, flooded facilities, power outages, fuel shortages, damaged or destroyed property and equipment, and work interruptions. Although we maintain property and casualty insurance on our plant (excluding our outside plant) and may under certain circumstances be able to seek recovery of some additional costs through increased rates, only a portion of our additional costs directly related to such hurricanes and natural disasters 37 Table of Contents have historically been recoverable. We cannot predict whether we will continue to be able to obtain insurance for hazard-related damages or, if obtainable and carried, whether this insurance will be adequate to cover our losses. In addition, we expect any insurance of this nature to be subject to substantial deductibles and to provide for premium adjustments based on claims. Any future hazard-related costs and work interruptions could adversely affect our operations and our financial condition.
Tax audits or changes in tax laws could adversely affect us.
Like all large businesses, we are subject to frequent and regular audits by the Internal Revenue Service as well as state and local tax authorities. These audits could subject us to tax liabilities if adverse positions are taken by these tax authorities.
We believe that we have adequately provided for tax contingencies. However, our tax audits and examinations may result in tax liabilities that differ materially from those that we have recognized in our consolidated financial statements. Because the ultimate outcomes of all of these matters are uncertain, we can give no assurance as to whether an adverse result from one or more of them will have a material effect on our financial results.
Dividends received by certain investors may be subject to a new 3.8% Medicare tax on unearned income beginning on January1, 2013, and certain tax reform plans under consideration by the U.S. Congress could increase the dividend tax rate. Any significant increase in the U.S. tax rate on dividends could reduce demand for our stock, which could potentially depress its trading price.
Our agreements and organizational documents and applicable law could limit another party's ability to acquire us.
A number of provisions in our agreements and organizational documents and various provisions of applicable law may delay, defer or prevent a future takeover of CenturyLink unless the takeover is approved by our Board of Directors. For additional information, please see our Registration Statement on Form8-A/A filed with the SEC July1, 2009. This could deprive our shareholders of any related takeover premium.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
38 Table of Contents ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our property, plant and equipment consists principally of telephone lines, central office equipment, land and buildings related to our telephone operations. Our gross property, plant and equipment consisted of the following components as of the following dates: December31, 2012 2011 Land 2% 2% Fiber, conduit and other outside plant (1) 40% 41% Central office and other network electronics (2) 36% 33% Support assets (3) 19% 21% Construction in progress (4) 3% 3% Gross property, plant and equipment 100% 100% (1) Fiber, conduit and other outside plant consists of fiber and metallic cable, conduit, poles and other supporting structures.
(2) Central office and other network electronics consists of circuit and packet switches, routers, transmission electronics and electronics providing service to customers.
(3) Support assets consist of buildings, computers and other administrative and support equipment.
(4) Construction in progress includes inventory held for construction and property of the aforementioned categories that has not been placed in service as it is still under construction.
We own substantially all of our telecommunications equipment required for our business. However, we lease certain facilities, plant, equipment and software under various capital lease arrangements when the leasing arrangements are more favorable to us than purchasing the assets.
We also own and lease administrative offices in major metropolitan locations both in the United States and internationally. Substantially all of our network electronics equipment is located in buildings or on land that we own or lease within our local service area. Outside of our local service area, our assets are generally located on real property pursuant to an agreement with the property owner or another person with rights to the property. It is possible that we may lose our rights under one or more of these agreements, due to their termination or their expiration.
With the acquisitions of Qwest in April 2011 and Savvis in July 2011, we expanded our property to include data center assets, and the related facilities and communications equipment. The facilities that house Savvis' warehouses, network equipment and data centers are leased.
During 2012, we reclassified certain amounts reported in prior periods of inventory held for construction to conform to the current period presentation. This reclassification increased construction in progress at December31, 2011 by $55million with an offsetting decrease to fiber, conduit and other outside plant and central office and other network electronics by $8million and $47million, respectively.
Some of our property, plant and equipment is pledged to secure the long-term debt of subsidiaries. Our net property, plant and equipment was $19.0billion and $19.4billion at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Several putative class actions have been filed against us disputing our use of certain rights-of-way as described in "Legal ProceedingsLitigation Matters Relating to Qwest" in Item3 of this report. If we lose any of these rights-of-way or are unable to renew them, we may find it necessary to move or replace the affected portions of our network. However, we do not expect any material adverse impacts as a result of the loss of any of these rights.
39 Table of Contents ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In this section, when we refer to a class action as "putative" it is because a class has been alleged, but not certified in that matter. Until and unless a class has been certified by the court, it has not been established that the named plaintiffs represent the class of plaintiffs they purport to represent.
We have established accrued liabilities for the matters described below where losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable.
We are vigorously defending against all of the matters described below. As a matter of course, we are prepared both to litigate the matters to judgment, as well as to evaluate and consider all settlement opportunities.
Litigation Matters Relating to CenturyLink and Embarq In December 2009, subsidiaries of CenturyLink filed two lawsuits against subsidiaries of Sprint Nextel to recover terminating access charges for VoIP traffic owed under various interconnection agreements and tariffs which presently approximate $34million. The lawsuits allege that Sprint Nextel has breached contracts, violated tariffs, and violated the Federal Communications Act by failing to pay these charges. One lawsuit, filed on behalf of all legacy Embarq operating entities, was tried in federal court in Virginia in August 2010 and, in March 2011, a ruling was issued in our favor and against Sprint Nextel. In the first quarter of 2012, Sprint Nextel filed an appeal of this decision. The other lawsuit, filed on behalf of all Legacy CenturyLink operating entities, is pending in federal court in Louisiana. In that case, in early 2011 the Court dismissed certain of CenturyLink's claims, referred other claims to the FCC, and stayed the litigation. In April 2012, Sprint Nextel filed a petition with the FCC, seeking a declaratory ruling that CenturyLink's access charges do not apply to VoIP originated calls. We have not deferred revenue related to these matters as an adverse outcome is not probable based upon current circumstances.
In William Douglas Fulghum, et al. v. Embarq Corporation, et al.
, filed on December28, 2007 in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, a group of retirees filed a putative class action lawsuit challenging the decision to make certain modifications in retiree benefits programs relating to life insurance, medical insurance and prescription drug benefits, generally effective January1, 2006 and January1, 2008 (which, at the time of the modifications, was expected to reduce estimated future expenses for the subject benefits by more than $300million). Defendants include Embarq, certain of its benefit plans, its Employee Benefits Committee and the individual plan administrator of certain of its benefits plans. Additional defendants include Sprint Nextel and certain of its benefit plans. The Court certified a class on certain of plaintiffs' claims, but rejected class certification as to other claims. Embarq and other defendants continue to vigorously contest these claims and charges. On October14, 2011, the Fulghum lawyers filed a new, related lawsuit, Abbott et al. v. Sprint Nextel et al . CenturyLink/Embarq is not named a defendant in the lawsuit. In Abbott , approximately 1,500 plaintiffs allege breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the changes in retiree benefits that also are at issue in the Fulghum case. The Abbott plaintiffs are all members of the class that was certified in Fulghum on claims for allegedly vested benefits (Counts I and III), and the Abbott claims are similar to the Fulghum breach of fiduciary duty claim (Count II), on which the Fulghum court denied class certification. The Court has stayed proceedings in Abbott indefinitely. On February14, 2013, the Fulghum court dismissed the majority of the plaintiffs' claims in that case. Embarq and the other defendants will continue to vigorously contest any remaining claims in Fulghum and seek to have the claims in the Abbott case dismissed on similar grounds. We have not accrued a liability for these matters as it is premature (i)to determine whether an accrual is warranted and (ii)if so, to determine a reasonable estimate of probable liability.
40 Table of Contents Litigation Matters Relating to Qwest The terms and conditions of applicable bylaws, certificates or articles of incorporation, agreements or applicable law may obligate Qwest to indemnify its former directors, officers or employees with respect to certain of the matters described below and Qwest has been advancing legal fees and costs to certain former directors, officers or employees in connection with certain matters described below.
On September29, 2010, the trustees in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding for KPNQwest,N.V. (of which Qwest was a major shareholder) filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Haarlem, the Netherlands, alleging tort and mismanagement claims under Dutch law. Qwest and Koninklijke KPNN.V. ("KPN") are defendants in this lawsuit along with a number of former KPNQwest supervisory board members and a former officer of KPNQwest, some of whom were formerly affiliated with Qwest. Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that defendants' actions were a cause of the bankruptcy of KPNQwest, and they seek damages for the bankruptcy deficit of KPNQwest, which is claimed to be approximately 4.2billion (or approximately $5.6billion based on the exchange rate on December31, 2012), plus statutory interest. Two lawsuits asserting similar claims were previously filed against Qwest and others in federal courts in New Jersey in 2004 and Colorado in 2009; those courts dismissed the lawsuits without prejudice on the grounds that the claims should not be litigated in the United States.
On September13, 2006, Cargill Financial Markets,Plc and Citibank, N.A. filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, against Qwest, KPN, KPN TelecomB.V., and other former officers, employees or supervisory board members of KPNQwest, some of whom were formerly affiliated with Qwest. The lawsuit alleges that defendants misrepresented KPNQwest's financial and business condition in connection with the origination of a credit facility and wrongfully allowed KPNQwest to borrow funds under that facility. Plaintiffs allege damages of approximately 219million (or approximately $289million based on the exchange rate on December31, 2012). On April25, 2012, the court issued its judgment denying the claims asserted by Cargill and Citibank in their lawsuit. Cargill and Citibank are appealing that decision.
We have not accrued a liability for the above matters. Regarding the 2010 proceeding, we believe it is premature to determine whether an accrual is warranted and, if so, a reasonable estimate of our probable liability. Regarding the 2006 suit, we do not believe that liability is probable. We will continue to defend against both KPNQwest litigation matters vigorously.
Several putative class actions relating to the installation of fiber optic cable in certain rights-of-way were filed against Qwest on behalf of landowners on various dates and in courts located in 34 states in which Qwest has such cable (Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.) For the most part, the complaints challenge our right to install our fiber optic cable in railroad rights-of-way. The complaints allege that the railroads own the right-of-way as an easement that did not include the right to permit us to install our cable in the right-of-way without the Plaintiffs' consent. Most of the currently pending actions purport to be brought on behalf of state-wide classes in the named Plaintiffs' respective states, although one action pending before the Illinois Court of Appeals purports to be brought on behalf of landowners in Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin. In general, the complaints seek damages on theories of trespass and unjust enrichment, as well as punitive damages. After previous attempts to enter into a single nationwide settlement in a single court proved unsuccessful, the parties proceeded to seek court approval of settlements on a state-by-state basis. To date, the parties have received final approval of such settlements in 22 states (Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin), have received preliminary approval of the settlements in eight 41 Table of Contents states (California, Kentucky, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Utah), and have not yet received either preliminary or final approval in four states (Arizona, Massachusetts, New Mexico and Texas). We have accrued an amount that we believe is probable for these matters; however, the amount is not material to our consolidated financial statements.
Other Matters From time to time, we are involved in other proceedings incidental to our business, including patent infringement allegations, administrative hearings of state public utility commissions relating primarily to rate making, actions relating to employee claims, various tax issues, environmental law issues, grievance hearings before labor regulatory agencies, and miscellaneous third party tort actions. The outcome of these other proceedings is not predictable. However, based on current circumstances we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these other proceedings, after considering available defenses and insurance coverage, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

(3) Broadband subscribers are customers that purchase high-speed Internet connection service through their existing telephone lines and fiber-optic cables. During the second quarter of 2012, we updated our methodology for counting broadband subscribers to include residential, business and wholesale subscribers instead of only residential and small business subscribers. We have restated our previously reported amounts to reflect this change.
46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS All references to "Notes" in this Item7 refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item8 of this report. Certain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in Item1 of this report for factors relating to these statements and "Risk Factors" in Item1A of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Overview We are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services to our residential, business, governmental and wholesale customers. Our communications services include local and long-distance, network access, private line (including special access), public access, broadband, data, managed hosting (including cloud hosting), colocation, wireless and video services. In certain local and regional markets, we also provide local access and fiber transport services to competitive local exchange carriers and security monitoring. We strive to maintain our customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications services.
At December31, 2012, we operated approximately 13.7million access lines in 37 states, served approximately 5.8million broadband subscribers, and operated 54 data centers throughout North America, Europe and Asia. During 2012, we updated our methodology for counting broadband subscribers to include residential, business and wholesale subscribers instead of only residential and small business subscribers. We have restated our previously reported amounts to reflect this change. For purposes of counting our access lines, we include only those access lines that we use to provide services to external customers and exclude lines used solely by us and our affiliates. Our counting methodology also excludes unbundled loops and includes stand-alone broadband subscribers. Our methodology for counting access lines may not be comparable to those of other companies.
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CenturyLink,Inc. ("CenturyLink") and its majority-owned subsidiaries. These subsidiaries include SAVVIS,Inc. ("Savvis") as of July15, 2011 and Qwest Communications InternationalInc. ("Qwest") as of April1, 2011. See Note2Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report. Due to the significant size of these acquisitions, direct comparisons of our results of operations for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 to prior periods are less meaningful than usual. We discuss below, under "Results of OperationsSegment Results", certain trends that we believe are significant, even if they are not necessarily material to the combined company.
In the discussion that follows, we refer to the incremental business activities that we now operate as a result of the Savvis acquisition and the Qwest acquisition as "Legacy Savvis" and "Legacy Qwest", respectively. References to "Legacy CenturyLink", when used in reference to a comparison of our consolidated results for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, mean the business we operated prior to the Qwest and Savvis acquisitions. Due to the magnitude of our recent acquisitions in relation to Legacy CenturyLink operations, in the combined company variance discussions below we have separately reflected the impacts of both the Legacy Qwest and Legacy Savvis operations for enhanced visibility, although we actively manage the combined company through our four segments, as discussed further below.
We have incurred operating expenses related to our acquisitions of Savvis in July 2011, Qwest in April 2011 and Embarq in July 2009. These expenses are reflected in cost of services and products and 47 Table of Contents selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations as summarized below.
Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Cost of services and products: Integration and other expenses associated with acquisitions $ 22 43 37 Severance expenses, accelerated recognition of share-based awards and retention compensation associated with acquisitions  24 12 Total $ 22 67 49 Selling, general and administrative: Expenses incurred to effect acquisitions $  79 13 Integration and other expenses associated with acquisitions 25 172 64 Severance expenses, accelerated recognition of share-based awards and retention compensation associated with acquisitions 36 149 19 Total $ 61 400 96 This table does not include costs incurred by Qwest or Savvis prior to being acquired by us. Based on current plans and information, we estimate, in relation to our Qwest acquisition, total integration, severance and retention expenses to be between $600million to $700million (which includes approximately $464million of cumulative expenses incurred through December31, 2012) and our capital expenditures associated with integration activities will approximate $200million (which includes approximately $63million of cumulative capital expenditures incurred through December31, 2012). We anticipate that the amount of our integration costs in future years will vary substantially based on integration activities conducted during those periods and could in certain cases be significantly higher than those incurred by us during the year ended December31, 2012.
For several years prior to 2011, we reported our operations as a single segment. However, in 2011, in connection with our acquisitions of Qwest on April1, 2011 and Savvis on July15, 2011, we reorganized our business into the following operating segments:  Regional markets.
Consisted primarily of providing products and services to residential consumers, small to medium-sized businesses and regional enterprise customers;  Business markets.
Consisted primarily of providing products and services to enterprise and government customers;  Wholesale markets.
Consisted primarily of providing products and services to other communications providers; and  Savvis operations.
Consisted primarily of providing hosting and network services primarily to business customers provided by Legacy Savvis.
48 Table of Contents In the second quarter of 2012, in order to more effectively deploy the strategic assets acquired from Qwest and Savvis and to better serve our business and government customers, we restructured our business into the following operating segments:  Regional markets.
Consists primarily of providing strategic and legacy products and services to residential consumers, state and local governments, small to medium-sized businesses and enterprise customers that in each case are located mainly within one of our six regions. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers include our private line, broadband, MPLS, hosting, video services, and wireless services. Our legacy services offered to these customers consist primarily of local and long-distance service;  Wholesale markets.
Consists primarily of providing strategic and legacy products and services to other domestic and international communications providers. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers are mainly private line (including special access) and MPLS. Our legacy services offered to these customers include UNEs which allow our wholesale customers the use of our network or a combination of our network and their own networks to provide voice and data services to their customers, long-distance and switched access services;  Enterprise marketsnetwork.
Consists primarily of providing strategic and legacy network communications products and services to national and international enterprise and government customers. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers include our private line, broadband, MPLS and hosting services. Our legacy services offered to these customers consist primarily of local and long-distance services; and  Enterprise marketsdata hosting.
Consists primarily of providing colocation, managed hosting and cloud hosting services to national and international enterprise and government customers.
Due to system limitations, we have determined that it is impracticable to report 2010 segment information using our segment structure described above. As such, only 2011 financial data has been revised under our segment structure described above.
We now report financial information separately for each of these segments; however, our segment information does not include capital expenditures, total assets, or certain revenues and expenses that we manage on a centralized basis and are only reviewed by our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") on a consolidated basis. Our segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that our segments would have achieved had they operated as stand-alone entities during the periods presented. For additional information about our segments, see Note13Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report and "Results of OperationsSegment Results" below.
On January3, 2013, we announced a reorganization of our operating segments. Consequently, beginning with the first quarter of 2013, we will report the following four segments in our consolidated financial statements: consumer, business, wholesale and data hosting. The primary purpose of the reorganization is to strengthen our focus on the enterprise business market while continuing our commitment to our hosting and consumer customers. The reorganization combines business sales and operations functions that resided in the enterprise marketsnetwork segment and the regional markets segment into the new business segment. The remaining customers serviced by the regional markets segment will become the new consumer segment. Our wholesale markets and enterprises marketsdata hosting segments will not be impacted by the organizational realignment.
49 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table summarizes the results of our consolidated operations for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Our operating results include operations of Savvis for periods after July15, 2011 and Qwest for periods after April1, 2011.
Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions except per share amounts) Operating revenues $ 18,376 15,351 7,042 Operating expenses 15,663 13,326 4,982 Operating income 2,713 2,025 2,060 Other income (expense) (1,463 ) (1,077 ) (529 ) Income tax expense 473 375 583 Net income $ 777 573 948 Basic earnings per common share $ 1.25 1.07 3.13 Diluted earnings per common share $ 1.25 1.07 3.13 Due to our acquisitions of Qwest on April1, 2011 and Savvis on July15, 2011, our 2012 operating results reflect a full year of Qwest's and Savvis' results, as compared to our 2011 operating results, which reflect only nine months of Qwest's operating results and five and a half months of Savvis' operating results.
The increase in net income in 2012 was primarily due to the 2012 period containing a full year of Qwest's operating results compared to the 2011 period only containing nine months and a significant decrease from 2011 in the amount of acquisition, severance and integration expenses resulting from our recent acquisitions, as presented in the table under the "Overview" section above. The lower levels of net income in 2011 as compared to 2010 were primarily due to increased acquisition, severance and integration expenses attributable to the April1, 2011 acquisition of Qwest. The post-acquisition operations of Legacy Savvis and Legacy Qwest, which included substantial severance and integration expenses and significant acquisition accounting adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense based on valuation estimates, did not contribute significantly to our consolidated net income in 2011. See Note2Acquisitions and Note3Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report. Within our Legacy CenturyLink business, growth in strategic services revenues (which we describe further below) did not fully offset lower revenues from other services and products, further contributing to decreases in consolidated net income.
Diluted earnings per common share in 2012 was higher than 2011 as a result of increased net income for 2012. Diluted earnings per common share in 2011 was substantially lower than the amounts for the corresponding period of 2010 due to decreases in net income, as well as increases in the weighted average number of outstanding common shares. The increase in the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during 2012 and 2011 was primarily attributable to the issuance of approximately 294million shares in connection with the Qwest acquisition on April1, 2011 and the issuance of approximately 14.3million shares in connection with the Savvis acquisition on July15, 2011.
50 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our broadband subscribers, access lines and number of employees: As of December31, 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands) Operational metrics: Broadband subscribers 5,848 5,652 2,349 Access lines 13,748 14,584 6,489 Employees 47.0 49.2 20.3 During the second quarter of 2012, we updated our methodology for counting broadband subscribers to include residential, business and wholesale subscribers instead of only residential and small business subscribers. We have restated our previously reported amounts to reflect this change.
During the last several years, we have experienced revenue declines primarily due to declines in access lines, intrastate access rates and minutes of use. Prior to our acquisition, Qwest had experienced similar declines in its revenues. To mitigate these declines, we remain focused on efforts to, among other things:  promote long-term relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services;  provide new services, such as video, cloud hosting, managed hosting, colocation and other additional services that may become available in the future due to, among other things, advances in technology or improvements in our infrastructure;  provide our broadband and premium services to a higher percentage of our customers;  pursue acquisitions of additional assets if available at attractive prices;  increase usage of our networks; and  market our products and services to new customers.
Operating Revenues We currently categorize our products, services and revenues among the following four categories:  Strategic services , which include primarily broadband, private line (including special access which we market to wholesale and business customers who require dedicated equipment to transmit large amounts of data between sites), MPLS (which is a data networking technology that can deliver the quality of service required to support real-time voice and video), hosting (including cloud hosting and managed hosting), colocation, Ethernet, video (including resold satellite and our facilities-based video services), VoIP and Verizon Wireless services;  Legacy services , which include primarily local, long-distance, switched access, public access, ISDN (which uses regular telephone lines to support voice, video and data applications), and WAN services (which allows a local communications network to link to networks in remote locations);  Data integration , which includes the sale of telecommunications equipment to customers for use on their premises and related professional services, such as network management, installation and maintenance of data equipment and building of proprietary fiber-optic networks for our government and business customers; and  Other revenues, which consists primarily of USF revenue and surcharges. Unlike the first three revenue categories, other revenues are not included in our segment revenues.
51 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our operating revenues under our current revenue categorization which is presented in a manner that we believe will be useful for understanding the relevant trends affecting our business: Years Ended December31, Increase (Decrease) 2012 2011 CenturyLink Qwest Savvis Total (Dollars in millions) Strategic services $ 8,361 6,262 307 1,207 585 2,099 Legacy services 8,287 7,672 (633 ) 1,248  615 Data integration 672 537 19 116  135 Other 1,056 880 44 132  176 Total operating revenues $ 18,376 15,351 (263 ) 2,703 585 3,025 During 2012, operating revenues attributable to certain products and services were reclassified from legacy services to strategic services. Due to system limitations, we have determined that is impracticable to restate 2010's operating revenues to conform to our current revenue categorization. For comparability purposes, we have included our operating revenues for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010 under our prior revenue categorization: Years Ended December31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 CenturyLink Qwest Savvis Total (Dollars in millions) Strategic services $ 6,254 2,049 150 3,572 483 4,205 Legacy services 7,680 4,288 (483 ) 3,875  3,392 Data integration 537 158 (23 ) 402  379 Other 880 547 (24 ) 357  333 Total operating revenues $ 15,351 7,042 (380 ) 8,206 483 8,309 Our operating revenues increased substantially in both 2012 and 2011 as compared to 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to our acquisitions of Qwest on April1, 2011 and Savvis on July15, 2011. Total operating revenues increased $3.025billion in 2012 as compared to 2011 and increased $8.309billion in 2011 as compared to 2010. As reflected in the chart above, our acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis contributed incremental operating revenues (net of intercompany eliminations) of $2.7billion and $585million, respectively, to our 2012 revenues. Legacy CenturyLink operating revenues decreased $263million, or 1.7%, in 2012 and $380million, or 5.4%, in 2011 as compared to the prior year period. These decreases were primarily attributable to declines in legacy services revenues, which reflected the continuing loss of access lines in our markets. At December31, 2012, we had 13.748million access lines, of which 8.055million were in Legacy Qwest's markets. Access lines in our Legacy CenturyLink markets declined to 5.693million at December31, 2012 from 6.051million at December31, 2011, a decrease of 5.93% during 2012, and were 6.489million at December31, 2010, a decrease of 6.75% during 2011. We believe the decline in the number of access lines was primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive products and services. We estimate that our access lines loss will be between 5.4% and 5.9% in 2013. Our legacy services revenues were also negatively impacted in 2012 by the continued reduction in access revenues and continued migration of customers to bundled service offerings at lower effective rates. The decreases in our legacy services revenues were partially offset by higher revenues from strategic services revenues. Ethernet, 52 Table of Contents MPLS, Internet Protocol Television ("IPTV"), VoIP and broadband services accounted for a majority of the growth in strategic services revenues.
We are aggressively marketing our strategic services (including our data hosting services) and data integration to offset the continuing declines in our legacy services revenues. We believe our recent acquisitions of Savvis and Qwest will strengthen our ability to achieve this goal.
Further analysis of our operating revenues by segment is provided below in "Segment Results." Operating Expenses Our current definitions of operating expenses are as follows:  Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are expenses incurred in providing products and services to our customers. These expenses include: employee-related expenses directly attributable to operating and maintaining our network (such as salaries, wages, benefits and professional fees); facilities expenses (which include third-party telecommunications expenses we incur for using other carriers' networks to provide services to our customers); rents and utilities expenses; equipment sales expenses (such as data integration and modem expenses); costs for universal service funds ("USF") (which are federal and state funds that are established to promote the availability of telecommunications services to all consumers at reasonable and affordable rates, among other things, and to which we are often required to contribute); and other expenses directly related to our network and hosting operations.
Selling, general and administrative expenses are corporate overhead and other operating expenses. These expenses include: employee-related expenses (such as salaries, wages, internal commissions, benefits and professional fees) directly attributable to selling products or services and employee-related expenses for administrative functions; marketing and advertising; taxes (such as property and other taxes) and fees; external commissions; bad debt expense; and other selling, general and administrative expenses.
These expense classifications may not be comparable to those of other companies.
During 2012 and 2011, our operating expenses increased substantially in comparison to 2011 and 2010 primarily due to our acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis.
The following tables summarize our operating expenses: Years Ended December31, Increase (Decrease) 2012 2011 CenturyLink Qwest Savvis Total (Dollars in millions) Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 7,639 6,325 (73 ) 1,082 305 1,314 Selling, general and administrative 3,244 2,975 (367 ) 483 153 269 Depreciation and amortization 4,780 4,026 (149 ) 741 162 754 Total operating expenses $ 15,663 13,326 (589 ) 2,306 620 2,337 53 Table of Contents Years Ended December31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 CenturyLink Qwest Savvis Total (Dollars in millions) Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 6,325 2,544 (4 ) 3,523 262 3,781 Selling, general and administrative 2,975 1,004 60 1,791 120 1,971 Depreciation and amortization 4,026 1,434 72 2,394 126 2,592 Total operating expenses $ 13,326 4,982 128 7,708 508 8,344 The acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis largely contributed to the increase in total operating expenses of $2.337billion in 2012. Excluding the effects of Legacy Qwest and Legacy Savvis expenses, total operating expenses in 2012 decreased $589million, or 4.4%, due primarily to decreases in employee-related expenses, severance and integration expenses relating to our recent acquisitions and depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in total operating expenses of $8.344billion in 2011 was largely attributable to the inclusion of $7.7billion in post-acquisition Legacy Qwest operating expenses (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated operating expenses. In addition, the acquisition of Savvis on July15, 2011 increased our consolidated operating expenses for 2011 by $508million. As discussed in the "Overview" section, our operating expenses for 2012, 2011, and 2010 included substantial severance and integration costs related to the Qwest, Savvis and Embarq acquisitions as well as significant acquisition accounting adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense. See Note2Acquisitions and Note3Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report. Excluding the effects of Legacy Qwest and Legacy Savvis expenses, total operating expenses in 2011 increased $128million, or 2.6%, due primarily to integration costs associated with the Qwest acquisition and increased costs of providing our facilities-based video services to more customers.
For the year ended December31, 2012, Legacy CenturyLink cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) were slightly lower as compared to 2011. During the year, we experienced decreases in severance, salaries and wages and related benefits, which were partially offset by increases in customer premise equipment and maintenance costs, network expense, and contractor costs. Cost of services and products for Legacy CenturyLink operations was relatively unchanged in 2011. For 2011, $55million of higher costs of services and products associated with providing our facilities-based video service were substantially offset by a $28million decrease in salaries and benefits and a $20million decrease in facilities costs associated with the migration of legacy Embarq long-distance traffic to our internal networks.
Legacy CenturyLink selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $367million, or 2.8%, for 2012 as compared to 2011, while selling, general and administrative expenses increased $60million, or 6.0%, for 2011 as compared to 2010. The decrease in 2012 primarily was due to a decrease in severance and integration expenses relating to our recent acquisitions, as well as a decrease in salaries, wages, and employee benefits due to a reduction in headcount. For all periods presented, our expenses include significant transaction, severance and integration expenses related to the Qwest, Savvis and Embarq acquisitions (see table in "Overview" above). Changes in the timing and amount of Qwest and Savvis integration expenses resulted in a net increase in Legacy CenturyLink's 2011 selling, general and administrative expenses compared to 2010. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $33million in 2011 in operating taxes, which were primarily due to favorable property tax and transaction tax settlements. In addition, in 2011 we had a decrease of $20million in compensation expenses, which were primarily due to workforce reductions and lower pension expense.
54 Table of Contents Effective January1, 2012, we changed our rates of capitalized labor as we transitioned certain of Qwest's legacy systems to our historical company systems. This transition resulted in an estimated $40million to $55million increase in the amount of labor capitalized as an asset compared to the amount that would have been capitalized if Qwest had continued to use its legacy systems and a corresponding estimated $40million to $55million decrease in operating expenses for the year ended December31, 2012. The reduction in expenses described above, net of tax, increased net income approximately $25million to $34million, or $0.04 to $0.05 per basic and diluted common share, for the year ended December31, 2012.
Excluding the effects of the acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis, depreciation and amortization expense for Legacy CenturyLink decreased $149million, or 3.7%, due to annual updates of our depreciation rates for capitalized assets and an out-of-period accounting adjustment, partially offset by net growth in capital assets. Depreciation and amortization for Legacy CenturyLink increased $72million, or 5.0%, in 2011 primarily due to higher levels of property, plant and equipment and an out-of-period accounting adjustment corrected in 2012.
Further analysis of our operating expenses by segment is provided below in "Segment Results." Other Consolidated Results The following tables summarize our total other income (expense) and income tax expense: Years Ended December31, Increase (Decrease) 2012 2011 CenturyLink Qwest Savvis Total (Dollars in millions) Interest expense $ (1,319 ) (1,072 ) 62 169 16 247 Net loss on early retirement of debt (179 ) (8 ) 179 (8 )  171 Other income (expense) 35 3 32 (1 ) 1 32 Total other income (expense) $ (1,463 ) (1,077 ) 273 160 17 386 Income tax expense $ 473 375 nm nm nm 98 Years Ended December31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 CenturyLink Qwest Savvis Total (Dollars in millions) Interest expense $ (1,072 ) (544 ) 34 486 8 528 Net loss on early retirement of debt (8 )   8  8 Other income (expense) 3 15 17 (2 ) (3 ) 12 Total other income (expense) $ (1,077 ) (529 ) 51 492 5 548 Income tax expense $ 375 583 nm nm nm (208 ) nmAttributing changes in income tax expense to the acquisitions of Savvis and Qwest is considered not meaningful.
55 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December31, 2012 increased by $247million compared to 2011. This increase is primarily due to the 2012 period containing a full year of Qwest interest expense compared to the 2011 period containing only nine months. Interest expense increased $528million in 2011 primarily due to higher debt balances associated principally with debt assumed in the Qwest acquisition and incurred to finance the Savvis acquisition. See Note4Long-term Debt and Credit Facilities to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information about those transactions.
Interest expense for Legacy CenturyLink increased $62million, or 5.8%, in 2012 compared to 2011 and increased $34million, or 6.3%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in both years is substantially due to interest on our $2billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in June 2011 to finance the Savvis acquisition. The 2012 increase is due to those notes being outstanding for a full year versus a partial year in 2011. The 2011 increase was due to those notes being outstanding for a partial year versus not at all in 2010.
Net Loss on Early Retirement of Debt In the fourth quarter of 2012, QCII redeemed certain of its outstanding debt securities, which resulted in a gain of $15million.
In the second quarter of 2012, our subsidiaries Embarq and QC completed premium-priced cash tender offers for the purchase of certain of their respective outstanding debt securities, resulting in an aggregate loss of $190million. Also in the second quarter of 2012, our subsidiaries Embarq and QCII redeemed certain of their respective outstanding debt securities which resulted in a net loss of $9million.
During 2012, QCII and QC redeemed certain of their outstanding debt securities, which resulted in a gain of $5million.
In the fourth quarter and second quarter of 2011, QC redeemed certain of its outstanding debt securities which resulted in a total net loss of $8million.
Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations, including our share of income from our 49% interest in a cellular partnership, interest income, gains and losses from non-operating asset dispositions and impairments and foreign currency gains and losses. Other income for Legacy CenturyLink was greater for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to 2011 due to gains on the sales of our auction rate securities and the recognition in 2011 of $16million in transaction expenses incurred in connection with terminating an unused bridge loan financing commitment related to the Savvis acquisition. See Note2Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report. Other income for Legacy CenturyLink decreased $17million in 2011, as compared to 2010 primarily due to the $16million in transaction expenses discussed above.
Income Tax Expense Our income tax expense for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011increased $98million and decreased $208million, respectively, from the amounts for the comparable prior year. Our increase in 2012 was primarily due to a $302million, or 32%, increase in income before income tax expense as compared to 2011. Our decrease in 2011 was primarily due to a decrease in income before income tax expense, which was attributable to a decline in operating income and increased interest expense directly related to the acquisition of Qwest. For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, our effective income tax rate was 37.8%, 39.6% and 38.1%, respectively. The 2012 effective tax rate reflects the $16million reversal of a valuation allowance related to the auction rate securities we sold in 2012, 56 Table of Contents a $12million benefit related to state NOLs net of valuation allowance, and a $6million expense associated with reversing a receivable related to periods that have been effectively settled with the IRS. The 2011 rate increase was due in part to $24million of non-deductible transaction costs and an $8million valuation allowance recorded on deferred tax assets that require future income of a special character to realize the benefits. Such increase was partially offset by a $16million reduction in our valuation allowance related to state NOLs due primarily to the effects of a tax law change in one of the states in which we operate. Certain merger-related costs incurred during 2010 are also non-deductible for income tax purposes and similarly increased our effective income tax rate. See Note12Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report and "Income Taxes" below for additional information.
Segment Results As described further above under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverview," we revised our segment structure in 2012 and restated previously reported segment results for the year ended December31, 2011 to conform to our 2012 segment presentation. The following table summarizes our segment results for 2012 and 2011 under our segment categorization at December31, 2012.
Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 (Dollars in millions) Total segment revenues $ 17,320 14,471 Total segment expenses 8,094 6,513 Total segment income $ 9,226 7,958 Total margin percentage 53% 55% Regional markets: Revenues $ 9,876 8,743 Expenses 4,218 3,673 Income $ 5,658 5,070 Margin percentage 57% 58% Wholesale markets: Revenues $ 3,721 3,305 Expenses 1,117 1,021 Income $ 2,604 2,284 Margin percentage 70% 69% Enterprise marketsnetwork: Revenues $ 2,609 1,933 Expenses 1,891 1,450 Income $ 718 483 Margin percentage 28% 25% Enterprise marketsdata hosting: Revenues $ 1,114 490 Expenses 868 369 Income $ 246 121 Margin percentage 22% 25% 57 Table of Contents Due to system limitations, we have determined that it is impracticable to restate 2010's reported segments to conform to our current segment categorization at December31, 2012. For comparability purposes, we have included our segment information for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010 based on the segment categorization we were operating under at the end of 2011.

Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Total segment revenues $ 17,320 14,471 6,495 Other operating revenues 1,056 880 547 Operating revenues reported in our consolidated statements of operations $ 18,376 15,351 7,042 Total segment income $ 9,226 7,958 4,092 Other operating revenues 1,056 880 547 Depreciation and amortization (4,780 ) (4,026 ) (1,434 ) Other unassigned operating expenses (2,789 ) (2,787 ) (1,145 ) Operating income reported in our consolidated statement of operations $ 2,713 2,025 2,060 Our segment revenues include all revenues from our strategic and legacy services and data integration as described in more detail above. Segment revenues are based upon each customer's classification to an individual segment. We report our segment revenues based upon all services provided to that segment's customers. We report our segment expenses for our four segments as follows:  Direct expenses, which primarily are specific expenses incurred as a direct result of providing services and products to segment customers, along with selling, general and administrative expenses that are directly associated with specific segment customers or activities; and  Allocated expenses, which include network expenses, facilities expenses and other expenses such as fleet and real estate expenses.
During the first quarter of 2012, as we transitioned certain of Qwest's legacy systems to our historical company systems, we updated our methodologies for reporting our direct expenses and for allocating our expenses to our segments. Specifically, we no longer include certain fleet expenses for our regional markets segment in direct expenses; they are now expenses allocated to our segments, with the exception of enterprise marketsdata hosting. In addition, we now more fully allocate network building rent and power expenses to our regional markets, wholesale markets and enterprise marketsnetwork segments. We determined that it was impracticable to recast our segment results for prior periods to reflect these changes in methodology.
During the second quarter of 2012, as we reorganized our business into our four segments as indicated above, we further revised our methodology for how we allocate our expenses to our segments to better align segment expenses with related revenues. Under our revised methodology, we no longer allocate certain product development costs to our segments, but we do now allocate certain expenses from our enterprise marketsdata hosting segment to our other three segments. We restated our segment results for 2011 to reflect these changes in our methodology. We determined that it was impracticable to recast our segment results for 2010 under our revised methodology.
We do not assign depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, as the related assets and capital expenditures are centrally managed. Similarly, severance expenses, restructuring expenses and, subject to an exception for our enterprise marketsdata hosting segment, certain centrally managed administrative functions (such as finance, information technology, legal and human resources) are not 59 Table of Contents assigned to our segments. Interest expense is also excluded from segment results because we manage our financing on a total company basis and have not allocated assets or debt to specific segments. In addition, other income (expense) does not relate to our segment operations and is therefore excluded from our segment results.
As discussed under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverview", beginning in the first quarter of 2013, we plan to report our operations under the following four segments: consumer, business, wholesale and data hosting.
Regional Markets The operations of our regional markets segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those described below.
Strategic services.
We continue to focus on increasing subscribers of our broadband services in our regional markets segment. In order to remain competitive, we believe continually increasing connection speeds is important. As a result, we continue to invest in our (broadband) network, which allows for the delivery of higher speed broadband services. While traditional broadband services are declining, they have been more than offset by growth in fiber-based broadband services. We also continue to expand our product offerings including facilities-based video services, Ethernet, MPLS and other managed services and we continue to refine our marketing efforts as we compete in a maturing market in which most consumers already have broadband services. We expect these efforts will improve our ability to compete and increase our strategic revenues;  Facilities-based video expenses.
As we continue to expand our facilities-based video service infrastructure, we are incurring start-up expenses in advance of the revenue that this service is expected to generate. Although, over time, we expect that our revenue for facilities-based video services will offset the expenses incurred, the timing of this revenue growth is uncertain;  Access lines.
Our voice revenues have been, and we expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses. Intense competition and product substitution continue to drive our access line losses. For example, many consumers are substituting cable and wireless voice and electronic mail, texting and social networking services for traditional voice telecommunications services. We expect that these factors will continue to negatively impact our business. As a result of the expected loss of revenues associated with access lines, we continue to offer service bundling and other product promotions to help mitigate this trend, as described below;  Service bundling and product promotions.
We offer our customers the ability to bundle multiple products and services. These customers can bundle local services with other services such as broadband, video, long-distance and wireless;  Data integration.
We expect both data integration revenue and the related costs will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as this offering tends to be more sensitive than others to changes in the economy and in spending trends of our state and local government customers, many of whom have recently experienced budget cuts; and  Operating efficiencies.
We continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our segment workforce in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in industry, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions.
60 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the results of operations from our regional markets segment: Regional Markets Segment Years Ended December31, Increase / (Decrease) 2012 2011 CenturyLink Qwest Savvis Total (Dollars in millions) Segment revenues: Strategic services $ 3,607 2,890 168 546 3 717 Legacy services 5,996 5,593 (399 ) 802  403 Data integration 273 260 (19 ) 32  13 Total revenues 9,876 8,743 (250 ) 1,380 3 1,133 Segment expenses: Direct 3,939 3,469 (44 ) 514  470 Allocated 279 204 52 20 3 75 Total expenses 4,218 3,673 8 534 3 545 Segment income $ 5,658 5,070 (258 ) 846  588 Segment margin percentage 57% 58% Segment Income The acquisition of Qwest on April1, 2011 largely contributed to an increase in our regional markets segment income of $588million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to 2011. Our consolidated segment margin percentage remained relatively unchanged from 2011 to 2012. Segment income for our Legacy CenturyLink operations decreased $258million as compared to 2011 reflecting declines in revenues while expenses remained relatively flat.
Segment Revenues Excluding revenues attributable to the Legacy Qwest and Legacy Savvis acquisitions, regional markets revenues decreased $250million, or 2.9%, for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to 2011 due to declines in legacy services revenues and the implementation of the CAF order, partially offset by growth in strategic services revenues. Legacy services revenues decreased primarily due to declines in local and long-distance services associated principally with access line losses resulting from the competitive pressures and product substitution described previously. Growth in strategic services revenues was principally due to increases in the number of broadband subscribers as well as volume increases in our facilities-based video, Ethernet, and MPLS services.
Segment Expenses Regional markets total expenses, exclusive of Legacy Qwest and Legacy Savvis expenses, increased $8million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to 2011, due to an increase in allocated expenses. Allocated expenses increased primarily due to our updated methodology more fully allocating to our segments network and building rent and related power expenses. Direct expenses decreased due to decreases in employee related expenses, fleet expenses and marketing costs, which were partially offset by increases in customer premise equipment costs and network service costs.
61 Table of Contents Wholesale Markets The operations of our wholesale markets segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those described below:  Private line services (including special access).
Demand for our private line services continues to increase, despite our customers' optimization of their networks, industry consolidation and technological migration. While we expect that these factors could negatively impact our wholesale markets segment, we ultimately believe the bandwidth consumption growth in our fiber-based special access services provided to wireless carriers for backhaul will, over time, offset the decline in copper-based special access services provided to wireless carriers as they migrate to Ethernet services, although the timing and magnitude of this technological migration is uncertain;  Access and local services revenues.
Our access and local services revenues have been and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by technological migration, industry consolidation, regulation and rate reductions. For example, wholesale consumers are substituting cable, wireless and VoIP services for traditional voice telecommunications services, resulting in continued access revenue loss. We expect these factors will continue to adversely impact our wholesale markets segment;  Switched access revenues.
We believe that changes related to the Connect America and Intercarrier Compensation Reform order ("CAF order") adopted by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") on October27, 2011 will substantially increase the pace of reductions in the amount of switched access revenues we receive in our wholesale markets segment;  Long-distance services revenues.
Wholesale long-distance revenues continue to decline as a result of customer migration to more technologically advanced services, price compression, declining demand for traditional voice services and industry consolidation; and  Operating efficiencies.
We continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our segment workforce in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in industry, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions. We also expect our wholesale markets segment to benefit indirectly from enhanced efficiencies in our company-wide network operations.
62 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the results of operations from our wholesale markets segment: Wholesale Markets Segment Years Ended December31, Increase / (Decrease) 2012 2011 CenturyLink Qwest Savvis Total (Dollars in millions) Segment revenues: Strategic services $ 2,296 1,915 33 339 9 381 Legacy services 1,424 1,389 (213 ) 248  35 Data integration 1 1     Total revenues 3,721 3,305 (180 ) 587 9 416 Segment expenses: Direct 169 174 (18 ) 13  (5 ) Allocated 948 847 (60 ) 155 6 101 Total expenses 1,117 1,021 (78 ) 168 6 96 Segment income $ 2,604 2,284 (102 ) 419 3 320 Segment margin percentage 70% 69% Segment Income The acquisition of Qwest on April1, 2011 largely contributed to an increase in our wholesale markets segment income of $320million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to 2011. Segment income for our Legacy CenturyLink operations decreased $102million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to 2011, primarily reflecting declines in revenues, as discussed further below.
Segment Revenues Excluding revenues attributable to the Legacy Qwest and Legacy Savvis acquisitions, wholesale markets revenues decreased $180million, or 5.5%, for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to 2011. This decrease reflects substantially lower revenues from legacy services, partially offset by growth in revenues from strategic services. Strategic services revenues increased primarily due to growth in Ethernet and broadband services. The decrease in legacy services revenues was driven by continuing declines in access, long-distance and local services volumes, and the implementation of the CAF order, as well as the substitution of cable, wireless, VoIP and other services for traditional voice telecommunications services.
Segment Expenses Wholesale markets expenses, exclusive of Legacy Qwest and Legacy Savvis expenses, decreased $78million, or 7.6%, for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to 2011. The decrease in Legacy CenturyLink wholesale markets expenses was primarily due to a lower allocation of fleet and network real estate expenses due to the above-described updated expense allocation methodology and to reductions in employee related expenses.
63 Table of Contents Enterprise MarketsNetwork The operations of our enterprise marketsnetwork segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those described below.
Strategic services.
Our mix of total segment revenues continues to migrate from legacy services to strategic services as our enterprise and government customers increasingly demand customized and integrated data, Internet and voice services. We offer to our enterprise customers diverse combinations of products and services such as private line, MPLS and VoIP services. We believe these services afford our customers more flexibility in managing their communications needs and enable us to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their operations. Although we are experiencing price compression on our strategic services due to competition, we expect overall revenues from these services to grow;  Legacy services.
We face intense competition with respect to our legacy services and continue to see customers migrating away from these services into strategic services. In addition, our legacy services revenues have been, and we expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses and price compression;  Data integration.
We expect both data integration revenue and the related costs will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as this offering tends to be more sensitive than others to changes in the economy and in spending trends of our federal government customers. In addition, changes to our compensation programs, which focus on higher margin strategic services, could negatively impact data integration revenues; and  Operating efficiencies.
We continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our segment workforce in response to our productivity improvements while achieving operational efficiencies and improving our processes through automation. We also expect our enterprise marketsnetwork segment to benefit indirectly from enhanced efficiencies in our company-wide network operations.
The following table summarizes the results of operations from our enterprise marketsnetwork segment: Enterprise MarketsNetwork Segment Years Ended December31, Increase / (Decrease) 2012 2011 CenturyLink Qwest Savvis Total (Dollars in millions) Segment revenues: Strategic services $ 1,344 967 56 314 7 377 Legacy services 867 690 (21 ) 198  177 Data integration 398 276 38 84  122 Total revenues 2,609 1,933 73 596 7 676 Segment expenses: Direct 781 568 33 180  213 Allocated 1,110 882 (40 ) 261 7 228 Total expenses 1,891 1,450 (7 ) 441 7 441 Segment income $ 718 483 80 155  235 Segment margin percentage 28% 25% 64 Table of Contents Segment Income The acquisition of Qwest on April1, 2011 substantially increased the scale of our enterprise marketsnetwork segment, resulting in an increase of $235million in segment income for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to 2011. Segment income for our Legacy CenturyLink operations increased $80million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to 2011, primarily reflecting an increase in revenues.
Segment Revenues Excluding revenues attributable to the Legacy Qwest and Legacy Savvis acquisitions, enterprise marketsnetwork segment revenues increased by $73million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to growth in strategic services revenues from increased volumes of MPLS services and increased data integration revenues from maintenance and installation of customer premise equipment. Lower revenues from legacy services were driven by access line losses and price compression partially offset the increases in strategic services revenues and data integration revenues.
Segment Expenses Enterprise marketsnetwork segment expenses, exclusive of Legacy Qwest and Legacy Savvis expenses, decreased by $7million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011 primarily due to decreased allocated expenses partially offset by increased direct expenses. Allocated expenses decreased for the year ended December31, 2012 due to lower allocation of fleet and network real estate expenses due to the above-described updated expense allocation methodology. The increase in direct expenses was primarily due to increased maintenance and installation costs associated with customer premise equipment, partially offset by decreases in employee related expenses.
Enterprise MarketsData Hosting The operations of our enterprise marketsdata hosting segment is largely comprised of the operations of our Legacy Savvis services for periods after the July15, 2011 acquisition date, which have been impacted by significant trends, including those described below.
Colocation.
Colocation is designed for clients seeking data center space and power for their server and networking equipment needs. Our data centers provide our domestic and international clients with a secure, high-powered, purpose-built location for their IT equipment. We anticipate continued pricing pressure for these services as wholesale vendors enter the enterprise colocation market; however, we believe that our combination of global data center assets, operational expertise and broad range of services strengthens our competitive position;  Managed hosting.
Our managed hosting services provide a fully managed solution for a customer's IT infrastructure and network needs, and include dedicated and cloud hosting services, utility and computing storage, consulting and managed security services. We expect increasing pricing pressure on the managed hosting business from competing cloud hosting offerings. However, we remain focused on expanding our managed hosting business, specifically in our cloud hosting offerings, which we believe is a key to growth. We believe that we have continued to strengthen our position in the cloud hosting market by adding differentiating features to our cloud hosting products; and  Operating efficiencies.
We continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our segment workforce in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in industry, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions.
65 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the results of operations from our enterprise marketsdata hosting segment: Enterprise MarketsData Hosting Segment Years Ended December31, Increase / (Decrease) 2012 2011 CenturyLink Qwest Savvis Total (Dollars in millions) Segment revenues: Strategic services $ 1,114 490 50 8 566 624 Total revenues 1,114 490 50 8 566 624 Segment expenses: Direct 940 415 56 11 458 525 Allocated (72 ) (46 ) 1 (10 ) (17 ) (26 ) Total expenses 868 369 57 1 441 499 Segment income $ 246 121 (7 ) 7 125 125 Segment margin percentage 22% 25% Segment Income The acquisition of Savvis on July15, 2011 substantially increased the scale of our enterprise marketsdata hosting segment, resulting in an increase of $125million in our segment income for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011.
Segment Revenues Savvis operations accounted for 97% of our enterprise marketsdata hosting segment revenues for the year ended December31, 2012. Growth in strategic services is driven by roughly equivalent increases in both colocation and managed hosting.
Segment Expenses Excluding the expenses attributable to the Legacy Qwest and Legacy Savvis acquisitions, enterprise marketsdata hosting segment direct expenses increased for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011 primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits caused by a higher headcount and an increase in facility costs.
Due to the continuing use of Legacy Savvis accounting systems, the direct expenses of our enterprise marketsdata hosting segment includes certain data communication, operational, and selling, general, and administrative costs that are allocated to our other three segments and are offset by corporate allocated expenses which resulted in a negative net allocation impact.
Other Operational Matters Approximately 26% of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements that expired on October6, 2012. We are currently negotiating the terms of new agreements. In the meantime, the predecessor agreements have been extended, and the applicable unions have agreed to provide us with at least 24hour advance notice before terminating those predecessor agreements. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, our business and operating results could 66 Table of Contents be materially harmed. See "Risk FactorsOther Risks Affecting Our Business" in Item1A of this report. To help mitigate this potential risk, we have established contingency plans in which we would assign trained, non-represented employees to cover jobs for represented employees in the event of a work stoppage to provide continuity for our customers.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have identified certain policies and estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our past or present results of operations related to (i)business combinations; (ii)goodwill, customer relationships and other intangible assets; (iii)property, plant and equipment; (iv)pension and post-retirement benefits; (v)loss contingencies and litigation reserves; and (vi)income taxes. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or they have the potential to have a material impact, on our consolidated financial statements and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions made when accounting for the items described below are reasonable, based on information available at the time they are made. However, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.
Business Combinations We have accounted for our acquisitions of Qwest on April1, 2011 and Savvis on July15, 2011 under the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The portion of the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill. The estimates of fair value and resulting allocation of the purchase price related to our acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis involved significant estimates and judgments by our management. In arriving at the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we considered the following generally accepted valuation approaches: the cost approach, income approach and market approach. Our estimates also included assumptions about projected growth rates, cost of capital, effective tax rates, tax amortization periods, technology life cycles, the regulatory and legal environment and industry and economic trends. Small changes in the underlying assumptions could impact the estimates of fair value by material amounts, which could in turn materially impact our results of operations.
Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets We amortize customer relationships over primarily over an estimated life of 10years to 12.5years, using either the sum-of-the-years-digits or straight-line methods, depending on the type of customer. We amortize capitalized software, which consists primarily of assets obtained from the Qwest acquisition, using the straight-line method over estimated lives ranging up to seven years. Approximately $237million of our capitalized software represents costs to develop an integrated billing and customer care system and is being amortized over a 20year period that began in 2004. We amortize trade names and patent assets predominantly using the sum-of-the-years digits over an estimated life of four years. Other intangible assets not arising from business combinations are initially recorded at cost. Where there are no legal, regulatory, contractual or other factors that would reasonably limit the useful life of an intangible asset, we classify the intangible asset as indefinite-lived and such intangible assets are not amortized. We periodically review the estimated lives and methods used to amortize our other intangible assets. The amount of future amortization expense may differ materially from current amounts, depending on the results of our periodic reviews.
67 Table of Contents Our long-lived intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually, or, under certain circumstances, more frequently, such as when events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. These assets are carried at historical cost if their estimated fair value is greater than their carrying amounts. However, if their estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount, other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reduced to their estimated fair value through an impairment charge to our consolidated statements of operations. We early adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2012-2, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment, during the fourth quarter of 2012, which allows us the option to first review qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of whether the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired before performing a qualitative impairment test. Under this approach, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we will be required to compute and compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount to determine and measure the impairment loss, if any. We completed our qualitative assessment as of December31, 2012 and concluded it is not more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired; thus, no impairment charge was recorded in 2012.
Our goodwill was derived from numerous acquisitions where the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. For more information on our recent acquisitions and resulting fair values, see Note2Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report.
We are required to reassign goodwill to reporting units each time we reorganize our internal reporting structure which causes a change in our operating segments. Goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach. We utilize the earnings before interest, tax and depreciation as our allocation methodology as it represents a reasonable proxy for the fair value of the operations being reorganized.
We have attributed our goodwill balance to our segments at December31, 2012 as follows: (Dollars in millions) Regional markets $ 15,170 Wholesale markets 3,283 Enterprise marketsnetwork 1,788 Enterprise marketsdata hosting 1,491 Total goodwill $ 21,732 For additional information on the April1, 2012 reorganization of our segments, see Note13Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report.
We are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. We are required to write-down the value of goodwill in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Our reporting units, which we refer to as our segments, are not discrete legal entities with discrete financial statements. Our assets and liabilities are employed in and relate to the operations of multiple reporting units. Therefore, each time we perform goodwill impairment analysis on a reporting unit, we estimate the equity carrying value and future cash flows of each of our segments using allocation methodologies. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions are required to perform these allocations. We believe these estimates, judgments and assumptions to be reasonable, but slight changes in many of these can significantly affect each reporting unit's equity carrying value and future cash flows utilized for our goodwill impairment test. Our annual measurement date for testing goodwill impairment is September30. As of September30, 2012, we tested for goodwill impairment on our reporting units, which were our four operating segments (regional markets, wholesale markets, 68 Table of Contents enterprise marketsnetwork and enterprise marketsdata hosting) that we recognized following our internal reorganization earlier in 2012.
In the third quarter of 2011, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which permits us to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test, which requires us (i)in step one, to identify potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying value and (ii)in step two, to quantify any impairment identified in step one. At September30, 2012, as a result of the April1, 2012 internal reorganization of our four segments we did not have a baseline valuation to perform a qualitative assessment. We estimated the fair value of our four segments using an equal weighting based on a market approach and a discounted cash flow method. The market approach includes the use of comparable multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to ours. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows and a terminal value, which represents the expected normalized cash flows of the segments beyond the cash flows from the discrete nine-year projection period. We discounted the estimated cash flows for our regional markets, wholesale markets, and enterprise marketsnetwork segments using a rate that represents a market participant's weighted average cost of capital, which we determined to be approximately 6.0% as of the measurement date (which was comprised of an after-tax cost of debt of 3.2% and a cost of equity of 8.4%). We discounted the estimated cash flows of our enterprise marketsdata hosting segment using a rate that represents a market participant's estimated weighted average cost of capital, which we determined to be approximately 11.0% as of the measurement date (which was comprised of an after-tax cost of debt of 3.2% and a cost of equity of 12.0%). We also reconciled the estimated fair values of the segments to our market capitalization as of September30, 2012 and concluded that the indicated implied control premium of approximately 14% was reasonable based on recent transactions in the market place. Based on our analysis performed with respect to our reporting units described above, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of September30, 2012.
As of September30, 2012, based on our analysis performed with respect to our four reporting units, the estimated fair value of our equity exceeded our carrying value of equity for our regional markets, wholesale markets, enterprise marketsnetwork and enterprise marketsdata hosting segments by 19%, 130%, 78% and 10%, respectively.
We may be required to assess our goodwill for impairment before our next required testing date of September30, 2013 under certain circumstances, including any failure of our future operating results to meet forecasted expectations or any significant increases in our weighted average cost of capital. In addition, we cannot assure that adverse conditions will not trigger future goodwill impairment testing or an impairment charge. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause our actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed in our goodwill impairment testing. These factors include, but are not limited to, (i)further weakening in the overall economy; (ii)a significant decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization; (iii)changes in the discount rate; (iv)successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets; (v)adverse changes as a result of regulatory actions; (vi)a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the overall business climate; and (vii)recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of our reporting units. For additional information, see "Risk Factors" in Item1A of this report. We will continue to monitor certain events that impact our operations to determine if an interim assessment of goodwill impairment should be performed prior to the next required testing date of September30, 2013.
69 Table of Contents Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisitions was recorded based on its estimated fair value as of its acquisition date. Property, plant and equipment purchased subsequent to our acquisitions is recorded at cost plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required asset retirement obligation. Renewals and betterments of plant and equipment are capitalized while repairs, as well as renewals of minor items, are charged to operating expense. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on the straight-line method using class or overall group rates. The group method provides for the recognition of the remaining net investment, less anticipated net salvage value, over the remaining useful life of the assets. This method requires the periodic revision of depreciation rates.
Normal retirements of property, plant and equipment are charged against accumulated depreciation, with no gain or loss recognized. Other types of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and, when sold or retired, a gain or loss is recognized. We depreciate such property on the straight-line method over estimated service lives ranging from 3 to 45years.
We perform annual internal reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of the depreciable lives for our property, plant and equipment. Our reviews utilize models that take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, assumptions about technology evolution and, in certain instances, actuarially determined probabilities to estimate the remaining life of our asset base.
Due to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment, selecting the estimated economic life of telecommunications plant, equipment and software requires a significant amount of judgment. We regularly review data on utilization of equipment, asset retirements and salvage values to determine adjustments to our depreciation rates. The effect of a hypothetical one year increase or decrease in the estimated remaining useful lives of our property, plant and equipment would have decreased depreciation by approximately $460million or increased depreciation by approximately $650million, respectively.
We review long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. For measurement purposes, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities, absent a material change in operations. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Recoverability of the asset group to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the asset group's carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. We determine fair values by using a combination of comparable market values and discounted cash flows, as appropriate. During 2012, we did not incur changes in events or circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, may not be recoverable. As a result, no impairment charge was recorded in 2012.
Pension and Post-Retirement Benefits We sponsor several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans (referred to as our pension plans) for a substantial portion of our employees. In addition to these tax "qualified" pension plans, we also maintain several non-qualified pension plans for certain eligible highly compensated employees. We also maintain post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees.
70 Table of Contents Pension and post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits attributed to eligible employees' service during the year, as well as interest on benefit obligations, are accrued currently. Pension and post-retirement benefit expenses are recognized over the period in which the employee renders service and becomes eligible to receive benefits as determined using the projected unit credit method. Pension prior service costs and certain actuarial gains and losses are recognized as components of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits. Post-retirement healthcare prior service costs are recognized as components of net periodic expense over the average expected years to full benefit eligibility for active employees. Certain post-retirement actuarial gains or losses are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average expected future working lifetime of active employees.
In computing the pension and post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits expenses and obligations, the most significant assumptions we make include discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, health care trend rates and our evaluation of the legal basis for plan amendments. The plan benefits covered by collective bargaining agreements as negotiated with our employees' unions can also significantly impact the amount of expense, benefit obligations and pension assets that we record.
The discount rate is the rate at which we believe we could effectively settle the benefit obligations as of the end of the year. We selected the discount rate based on a cash flow matching analysis using hypothetical yield curves developed by an actuarial firm from U.S. corporate bonds rated high quality and projections of the future benefit payments that constitute the projected benefit obligation for the plans. This process establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year's benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 60thto 90thpercentile of U.S. high quality bonds.
The expected rate of return on plan assets is the long-term rate of return we expect to earn on the plans' assets in the future. The rate of return is determined by the strategic allocation of plan assets and the long-term risk and return forecast for each asset class. The forecasts for each asset class are generated primarily from an analysis of the long-term expectations of various third party investment management organizations. The expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised, as necessary, to reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy.
To compute the expected return on pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets, we apply an expected rate of return to the fair value of the pension plan assets and to the fair value of the post-retirement benefit plan assets adjusted for contribution timing and for projected benefit payments to be made from the plan assets. Annual market volatility for these assets is reflected in subsequent years' net periodic combined benefits expense.
Changes in any of the above factors could significantly impact operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive (loss) income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income as well as the value of the liability and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets. The expected return on plan assets is reflected as a reduction to our pension and post-retirement benefit expense. If our assumed expected rates of return for 2012 were 100 basis points lower, our qualified pension and post-retirement benefit expenses would have increased by $118million. If our assumed discount rates for 2012 were 100 basis points lower, our qualified pension and post-retirement benefit expenses would have increased by $78million and our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately $2.2billion. An increase of 100 basis points in the initial healthcare cost trend rate would have increased our post-retirement benefit expense by $11million and increased our projected post-retirement benefit obligation by $77million.
The trusts for the pension and post-retirement benefits plans hold investments in equities, fixed income, real estate and other assets such as private equity assets. The assets held by these trusts are 71 Table of Contents reflected at estimated fair value as of December31, 2012. For additional information on our trust investments, see Note8Employee Benefits to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report.
Loss Contingencies and Litigation Reserves We are involved in several material legal proceedings, as described in more detail in "Legal Proceedings" in Item3 of this report. We assess potential losses in relation to these and other pending or threatened tax and legal matters. For matters not related to income taxes, if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we recognize an expense for the estimated loss. To the extent these estimates are more or less than the actual liability resulting from the resolution of these matters, our earnings will be increased or decreased accordingly. If the differences are material, our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted. If a loss is considered reasonably possible, we disclose the estimate of the potential loss if material but we do not recognize any expense for the potential loss.
For matters related to income taxes, we determine that if the impact of an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority, then we recognize a benefit for the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Though the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law, the body of statutory, regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous. Because of this, whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain. The overall tax liability recorded for uncertain tax positions as of the successor dates of December31, 2012 and December31, 2011, considers the anticipated utilization of any applicable tax credits and net operating losses ("NOLs").
Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes includes amounts for tax consequences deferred to future periods. We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflecting future tax consequences attributable to tax net operating losses, or NOLs, tax credit carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax bases of those assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are computed using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
The measurement of deferred taxes often involves the exercise of considerable judgment related to the realization of tax basis. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment that tax positions taken in filed tax returns and the resulting tax basis, are more likely than not to be sustained if they are audited by taxing authorities. Also, assessing tax rates that we expect to apply and determining the years when the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income requires judgment about the future apportionment of our income among the states in which we operate. Any changes in our practices or judgments involved in the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.
We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities as described above. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be recovered. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether adjustments to our valuation allowance are appropriate in light of changes in facts or circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. In making this evaluation, we rely on our recent history of pre-tax earnings, estimated timing of future deductions and benefits represented by the deferred tax assets and our forecasts of future earnings, the latter two 72 Table of Contents of which involve the exercise of significant judgment. At December31, 2012, we established a valuation allowance of $281million, primarily related to state NOLs, as it is more likely than not that this amount will not be utilized prior to expiration. If forecasts of future earnings and the nature and estimated timing of future deductions and benefits change in the future, we may determine that a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets is appropriate, which could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. See Note12Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report for additional information.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview At December31, 2012, we held cash and cash equivalents of $211million and we had $1.180billion available under our $2billion revolving credit facility (referred to as our "Credit Facility", which is described further below). At December31, 2012, cash and cash equivalents of $58million were held in foreign bank accounts for the purpose of funding our foreign operations. Repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local law and subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Excluding cash used for acquisitions, we have generally relied on cash generated by operations and our Credit Facility to fund our operating and capital expenditures and other cash requirements.
At December31, 2012, we had a working capital deficit of $982million, reflecting current liabilities of $4.595billion and current assets of $3.613billion, compared to negative working capital of $500million at December31, 2011. The unfavorable change in our working capital position is primarily due to an increase in current maturities of long-term debt of $725million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $193million. We anticipate that our existing cash balances and net cash provided by operating activities will enable us to meet our other current obligations, fund capital expenditures and pay dividends to our shareholders. We also may draw on our Credit Facility as a source of liquidity if and when necessary.
We currently expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends in respect of our common stock, subject to our board's discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time.
Credit Facilities On April6, 2012, we amended and restated our $1.7billion revolving credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount available to $2billion and to extend the maturity date to April 2017. This amended credit facility (the "Credit Facility") has 18 lenders, with commitments ranging from $2.5million to $181million and allows us to obtain revolving loans and to issue up to $400million of letters of credit, which upon issuance reduce the amount available for other extensions of credit. Interest is assessed on borrowings using either the LIBOR or the base rate (each as defined in the Credit Facility) plus an applicable margin between 1.25% and 2.25% per annum for LIBOR loans and 0.25% and 1.25% per annum for base rate loans depending on our then current senior unsecured long-term debt rating. Our obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Embarq and QCII, and one of QCII's wholly-owned subsidiaries. In the event of a ratings decline below "investment grade" as defined, Savvis and its operating subsidiaries will become guarantors of the Credit Facility. At December31, 2012, we had $820million in borrowings and no amounts of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility.
Under the Credit Facility, we, and our indirect subsidiary, Qwest Corporation, must maintain a debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined in our Credit Facility) ratio of not more than 4.0:1.0 and 2.85:1.0, respectively, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the four quarters then ended. The Credit Facility also contains a negative pledge covenant, which generally requires us to secure equally and ratably any advances under the Credit Facility if we 73 Table of Contents pledge assets or permit liens on our property for the benefit of other debtholders. The Credit Facility also has a cross payment default provision, and the Credit Facility and certain of our debt securities also have cross acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. To the extent that our EBITDA (as defined in our Credit Facility) is reduced by cash settlements or judgments, including in respect of any of the matters discussed in Note15Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report, our debt to EBITDA ratios under certain debt agreements will be adversely affected. This could reduce our financing flexibility due to potential restrictions on incurring additional debt under certain provisions of our debt agreements or, in certain circumstances, could result in a default under certain provisions of such agreements.
In April 2011, we entered into a $160million uncommitted revolving letter of credit facility. At December31, 2012, our outstanding letters of credit totaled $120million under this facility.
Stock Repurchase Program On February13, 2013, we announced our board's approval of a two-year program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $2.0billion of our outstanding common stock. We expect to execute this share repurchase program primarily in open market transactions, subject to market conditions and other factors.
Debt and Other Financing Arrangements Approximately $176million of our CenturyLink,Inc. SeriesO 5.500% notes will mature on April1, 2013, and $750million of Qwest Corporation floating rate senior notes will mature on June15, 2013. In addition, approximately $59million of Embarq 6.875% notes and $50million of Embarq 6.750% notes will mature on July15, 2013 and August15, 2013, respectively. Subject to market conditions, we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to refinance a substantial portion of our maturing debt, including issuing QC debt securities to refinance its maturing debt. The availability, interest rate and other terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned to us and QC by credit rating agencies, among others factors.
Following our announcement on February13, 2013 of changes in our capital allocation plans, one credit agency downgraded CenturyLink's debt credit ratings and another indicated that it has placed CenturyLink's debt credit ratings under review for a downgrade. As of the date of this report, the credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of CenturyLink,Inc. and Qwest Corporation were as follows: Agency CenturyLink,Inc.
Qwest Corporation Standard& Poor's BB BBB- Moody's Investors Service,Inc.
Baa3 (under review for downgrade) Baa3 (under review for downgrade) Fitch Ratings BB+ BBB- Additional downgrades of CenturyLink's senior unsecured debt ratings could under certain circumstances incrementally increase the cost of our borrowing under the Credit Facility or require us to add a couple of additional subsidiary guarantors thereunder. In addition, the recent actions of the credit agencies, and any additional downgrades in the future, could impact our access to debt capital or further raise our borrowing costs. See "Risk FactorsRisks Affecting our Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Item1A of this report.
74 Table of Contents Future Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our estimated future contractual obligations as of December31, 2012: 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 and thereafter Total (Dollars in millions) Long-term debt, including current maturities and capital lease obligations $ 1,205 781 545 1,488 2,313 14,255 20,587 Interest on long-term debt and capital leases (1) 1,317 1,279 1,220 1,148 1,034 14,397 20,395 Operating leases 297 252 219 183 156 964 2,071 Purchase commitments (2) 213 76 53 45 41 96 524 Post-retirement benefit obligation 74 73 72 70 68 1,100 1,457 Non-qualified pension obligations 6 5 5 5 5 22 48 Unrecognized tax benefits (3)      87 87 Other 14 4 5 8 11 135 177 Total future contractual obligations (4) $ 3,126 2,470 2,119 2,947 3,628 31,056 45,346 (1) Actual interest paid in all years may differ due to future refinancing of debt. Interest on our floating rate debt was calculated for all years using the rates effective at December31, 2012.
(2) We have various long-term, non-cancelable purchase commitments for advertising and promotion services, including advertising and marketing at sports arenas and other venues and events. We also have service related commitments with various vendors for data processing, technical and software support services. Future payments under certain service contracts will vary depending on our actual usage. In the table above we estimated payments for these service contracts based on the level of services we expect to receive.
(3) Represents the amount of tax and interest we would pay for our unrecognized tax benefits. Of our total balance of unrecognized tax benefits of $78million and related estimated interest and penalties of $33million, only $87million would result in future cash payments if our tax positions were not upheld. The remaining $24million is an unrecognized tax benefit in the form of a refund claim that, if not granted, would not result in a cash payment and therefore is not included in the table above. See Note12Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report for additional information. The timing of any payments for our unrecognized tax benefits cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, such amount is reflected in the "2018 and thereafter" column in the above table.
(4) The table is limited to contractual obligations only and does not include:  contingent liabilities;  our open purchase orders as of December31, 2012. These purchase orders are generally issued at fair value, and are generally cancelable without penalty;  other long-term liabilities, such as accruals for legal matters and other taxes that are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot determine with any degree of reliability the years in which these liabilities might ultimately settle;  cash funding requirements for qualified pension benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees. Benefits paid by our qualified pension plans are paid through trusts. Cash funding requirements for these trusts are not included in this table as we are not able to reliably estimate required contributions to the trusts. Our funding projections are discussed further below;  certain post-retirement benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees. Not all of our post-retirement benefit obligation amount is a contractual obligation and only the portion that we believe is a contractual obligation is reported in the table. See additional information on our benefits plans in Note8Employee Benefits to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report; 75 Table of Contents  contract termination fees. These fees are non-recurring payments, the timing and payment of which, if any, is uncertain. In the ordinary course of business and to optimize our cost structure, we enter into contracts with terms greater than one year to use the network facilities of other carriers and to purchase other goods and services. Our contracts to use other carriers' network facilities generally have no minimum volume requirements and are based on an interrelationship of volumes and discounted rates. Assuming we terminate these contracts in 2013, the contract termination fees would be approximately $495million. Under the same assumption, termination fees for these contracts to purchase goods and services would be $31million. In the normal course of business, we do not believe payment of these fees is likely; and  potential indemnification obligations to counterparties in certain agreements entered into in the normal course of business. The nature and terms of these arrangements vary. Historically, we have not incurred significant costs related to performance under these types of arrangements.
Capital Expenditures We incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis in order to enhance and modernize our networks, compete effectively in our markets and expand our service offerings. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted revenue growth, operating, productivity, expense or service impacts) and our expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, demand for our services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations. We estimate our total 2013 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.85billion to $3.05billion.
Our capital expenditures continue to be focused on our strategic services such as video, broadband and managed hosting services. In particular, we expect to continue to focus on expanding our fiber infrastructure, including installations of "fiber to the tower," which is a type of telecommunications network consisting of fiber-optic cables that run from a wireless carrier's mobile telephone switching office to cellular towers to enable the delivery of higher bandwidth services supporting mobile technologies than would otherwise generally be available through a more traditional copper-based telecommunications network. For more information on capital spending, see Items1 and 1A of this report.
We have agreed to accept approximately $35million of the $90million available to us from Phase1 of the FCC's Connect America Fund ("CAF") established by Congress to help telecommunications carriers defray the cost of providing broadband access to remote customers. We intend to use the funds to deploy broadband service for up to 45,000 homes in unserved rural areas principally in Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico, Virginia and Washington. We determined that restrictions on the use of these funds have made acceptance of additional CAF funds uneconomical. We have, however, filed with the FCC a waiver application, which, if granted, would allow us to deploy broadband services with CAF funds to approximately 60,000 more homes in high-cost unserved areas in our markets. We received approximately $32million in CAF funds during 2012 and received approximately $3million in January 2013.
Pension and Post-retirement Benefit Obligations We are subject to material obligations under our existing defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans. The accounting unfunded status as of December31, 2012 of our defined pension plans and other post-retirement benefit obligations were $2.6billion and $3.4billion, respectively. See Note8Employee Benefits to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report for additional information about our pension and other post-retirement benefit arrangements.
Benefits paid by our qualified pension plans are paid through a trust that holds all plan assets. We made cash contributions of $32million during the year ended December31, 2012 to our qualified pension plans. In the first quarter of 2013, we made cash contributions totaling $147million. Based on current laws and circumstances, we do not expect any further required contributions to the plans for 76 Table of Contents the remainder of 2013. For information on a 2012 law that reduced the amount of our required pension plan cash contributions, please see our Quarterly Report on Form10-Q for the quarter ended September30, 2012.
Certain of our post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits plans are unfunded. Several trusts hold assets that are used to help cover the health care costs of certain retirees. As of December31, 2012, the fair value of these trust assets was $626million; however, a portion of these assets is comprised of investments with restricted liquidity. We estimate that the more liquid assets in the trust will be adequate to provide continuing reimbursements for covered post-retirement health care costs for approximately four years. Thereafter, covered benefits will be paid either directly by us or from the trusts as the remaining assets become liquid. This projected four year period could be substantially shorter or longer depending on returns on plan assets, the timing of maturities of illiquid plan assets and future changes in benefits.
Our estimated annual long-term rate of return on the pension plans trust assets is 7.50% and for the post-retirement plans trust assets ranges from 6.00% to 7.50% based on the assets currently held; however, actual returns could vary widely in any given year.
Historical Information The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flow activities (which include cash flows from Savvis and Qwest after their respective acquisition dates): Years Ended December31, Increase (Decrease) 2012 2011 (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 6,065 4,201 1,864 Net cash used in investing activities (2,690 ) (3,647 ) (957 ) Net cash used in financing activities (3,295 ) (577 ) 2,718 Years Ended December31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,201 2,045 2,156 Net cash used in investing activities (3,647 ) (859 ) 2,788 Net cash used in financing activities (577 ) (1,175 ) (598 ) The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2012 and 2011is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis, which contributed net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $3.4billion in 2012 and $2.2billion in 2011. Our consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report provide information about the components of net income and differences between net income and net cash provided by operating activities. For additional information about our operating results, see "Results of Operations" above.
Net cash used in investing activities included payments for property, plant and equipment and capitalized software of $2.9billion in 2012, including $1.9billion for Qwest and Savvis' capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities included payments for property, plant and equipment and capitalized software of $2.4billion in 2011, including $1.3billion for Qwest and Savvis' post-acquisition capital expenditures, compared to $864million in 2010. In addition, we paid $1.7billion, net of $61million cash received, for the acquisition of Savvis on July15, 2011. Cash used in investing activities in 2011 was partially offset by cash acquired through the April1, 2011 acquisition of Qwest of $419million, net of $5million cash paid.
77 Table of Contents Net cash used in financing activities increased in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a net long-term debt pay down of $1.8billion in 2012 versus a net long-term debt issuance of $1.1billion in 2011, a $2.9billion difference. This difference was primarily due to the $2billion senior notes issued in June 2011to finance the Savvis acquisition. Also contributing was a $255million increase in dividends paid attributable to an increase in the average number of shares outstanding. These increases in cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a $631million increase in net borrowings under our Credit Facility. Net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2011 primarily due to us receiving net debt proceeds in excess of payments of approximately $1.1billion in 2011 versus debt payments of $500million in 2010. In addition, our cash dividends paid increased $677million in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily as a result of the issuance of 308million common shares in connection with our acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis in 2011.
On October26, 2012, QCII redeemed all $550million of its 8.00% Notes due 2015, which resulted in a gain of $15million.
On August29, 2012, certain subsidiaries of CenturyLink paid $29million and $30million, respectively, to retire its outstanding Rural Utilities Service and Rural Telephone Bank debt.
On August15, 2012, CenturyLink paid at maturity the $318million principal amount of its 7.875% Notes.
On July20, 2012, QC redeemed all $484million of its 7.50% Notes due 2023, which resulted in an immaterial loss.
On June25, 2012, QC issued $400million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Notes due 2052 in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $387million. The Notes are unsecured obligations and may be redeemed, in whole or in part, on or after July1, 2017 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued interest.
On May17, 2012, QCII redeemed $500million of its 7.50% Notes due 2014, which resulted in an immaterial gain.
On April23, 2012, Embarq redeemed the remaining $200million of its 6.738% Notes due 2013, which resulted in an immaterial loss.
On April18, 2012, CenturyLink entered into a term loan in the amount of $440million with CoBank and several other Farm Credit System banks. This term loan is payable in 29 consecutive quarterly installments of $5.5million in principal plus interest through April18, 2019, when the balance will be due. We have the option of paying monthly interest based upon either London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or the base rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus an applicable margin between 1.50% to 2.50% per annum for LIBOR loans and 0.50% to 1.50% per annum for base rate loans depending on our then current senior unsecured long-term debt rating. Our term loan is guaranteed by two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Embarq and Qwest Communications International Inc ("QCII"), and one of QCII's wholly-owned subsidiaries. The remaining terms and conditions of our term loan are substantially similar to those set forth in our Credit Facility (as described further in Note4Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report).
On April18, 2012, QC completed a cash tender offer to purchase a portion of its $811million of 8.375% Notes due 2016 and its $400million of 7.625% Notes due 2015. With respect to its 8.375% Notes due 2016, QC received and accepted tenders of approximately $575million aggregate principal amount of these notes, or 71%, for $722million including a premium, fees and accrued interest. With respect to its 7.625% Notes due 2015, QC received and accepted tenders of approximately $308million aggregate principal amount of these notes, or 77%, for $369million including a premium, fees and accrued interest. The completion of these tender offers resulted in a loss of $46million.
78 Table of Contents On April2, 2012, QC issued $525million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Notes due 2052 in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $508million. The Notes are unsecured obligations and may be redeemed, in whole or in part, on or after April1, 2017 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued interest.
On April2, 2012, Embarq completed a cash tender offer to purchase a portion of its $528million of 6.738% Notes due 2013 and its $2.0billion of 7.082% Notes due 2016. With respect to its 6.738% Notes due 2013, Embarq received and accepted tenders of approximately $328million aggregate principal amount of these notes, or 62%, for $360million including a premium, fees and accrued interest. With respect to its 7.082% Notes due 2016, Embarq received and accepted tenders of approximately $816million aggregate principal amount of these notes, or 41%, for $944million including a premium, fees and accrued interest. The completion of these tender offers resulted in a loss of $144million.
On March12, 2012, CenturyLink issued (i)$650million aggregate principal amount of 7.65% Senior Notes due 2042 in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, of approximately $644million and (ii)$1.4billion aggregate principal amount of 5.80% Senior Notes due 2022 in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, of approximately $1.389billion. The Notes are unsecured obligations and may be redeemed at any time on the terms and conditions specified therein.
On March1, 2012, QCII redeemed $800million of its 7.50% Notes due 2014, which resulted in an immaterial gain.
Certain Matters Related to Acquisitions Qwest's pre-existing debt obligations consisted primarily of debt securities issued by QCII and two of its subsidiaries while Savvis' remaining long-term debt obligations consist primarily of capital leases, all of which are now included in our consolidated debt balances. The indentures governing Qwest's debt securities contain customary covenants that restrict the ability of Qwest or its subsidiaries from making certain payments and investments, granting liens and selling or transferring assets. Based on current circumstances, we do not anticipate that these covenants will significantly restrict our ability to manage cash balances or transfer cash between entities within our consolidated group of companies as needed.
In accounting for the Qwest acquisition, we recorded Qwest's debt securities at their estimated fair values, which totaled $12.292billion as of April1, 2011. Our acquisition date fair value estimates were based primarily on quoted market prices in active markets and other observable inputs where quoted market prices were not available. The fair value of Qwest's debt securities exceeded their stated principal balances on the acquisition date by $693million, which we recorded as a premium.
79 Table of Contents The table below summarizes the portions of this premium recognized as a reduction to interest expense or extinguished during the periods indicated: Years Ended December31, Total Since Acquisition 2012 2011 (Dollars in millions) Amortized $ 86 154 240 Extinguished (1) 177 58 235 Total premiums recognized $ 263 212 475 (1) See "Debt and Other Financing Arrangements" for more information The remaining premium of $218million as of December31, 2012 will reduce interest expense in future periods, unless otherwise extinguished.
Net Operating Loss Carryforwards We are currently using federal NOLs to offset a portion of our federal taxable income. We expect to deplete a significant portion of these NOLs and certain other deferred tax attributes by 2014, and substantially all of these tax benefits by 2015. Once our NOLs are fully utilized, we expect that the amounts of our cash flows dedicated to the payment of federal taxes will increase substantially. The amounts of those payments will depend upon many factors, including future earnings, tax law changes and future tax circumstances. For additional information, see "Risk FactorsRisks Related to our Recent Acquisitions" appearing in Item1A of PartII of this report.
Other Matters CenturyLink has cash management arrangements with certain of its principal subsidiaries, in which substantial portions of the subsidiaries' cash is regularly advanced to CenturyLink. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, these advances are eliminated as intercompany transactions. Although CenturyLink periodically repays these advances to fund the subsidiaries' cash requirements throughout the year, at any given point in time we may owe a substantial sum to our subsidiaries under these advances, which are not recognized on our consolidated balance sheets.
In connection with reclassifying certain wireless spectrum assets as assets held for sale, during the second quarter of 2012 we reclassified $154million from "other intangible assets, net" to "current assetsother." For more information on the sale of these assets, see "BusinessOperationsProducts and ServicesAdditional Information" in Item1 of this report.
We also are involved in various legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. See Note15Commitment and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report for the current status of such legal proceedings, including matters involving Qwest.
Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt obligations and fluctuations in certain foreign currencies. We seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates.
80 Table of Contents From time to time, we have used derivative instruments to (i)lock-in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii)to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. As of December31, 2012, we had no such instruments outstanding. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Management periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure.
There were no material changes to market risks arising from changes in interest rates for the year ended December31, 2012, when compared to the disclosures provided in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2011.
At December31, 2012, we have approximately $19.9billion (excluding capital lease and other obligations with a carrying amount of $734million) of long-term debt outstanding, 89.9% of which bears interest at fixed rates and is therefore not exposed to interest rate risk. We had $2billion floating rate debt exposed to changes in the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in LIBOR relative to this debt would decrease our annual pre-tax earnings by $20million.
With our acquisition of Savvis in July 2011, we have become exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the foreign currencies in which its international operations are denominated, primarily the Euro, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the Japanese Yen and the Singapore Dollar. As a consolidated entity, the percentage of revenues generated and costs incurred that are denominated in these currencies are immaterial. We use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to this foreign currency risk, measuring the change in financial position arising from hypothetical 10% change in the exchange rates of these currencies, relative to the U.S. Dollar with all other variables held constant. The aggregate potential change in the fair value of assets resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in these exchange rates was $18million at December31, 2012.
Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of exposures to market risks. Actual values may differ materially from those presented above if market conditions vary from the assumptions used in the analyses performed. These analyses only incorporate the risk exposures that existed at December31, 2012.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support and we do not engage in leasing, hedging, or other similar activities that expose us to any significant liabilities that are not (i)reflected on the face of the consolidated financial statements, (ii)disclosed in Note15Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report, or in the Future Contractual Obligations table included in this Item7 above or (iii)discussed under the heading "Market Risk" above.

81 Table of Contents ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Management The Shareholders CenturyLink,Inc.: Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of our consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and necessarily include amounts determined using our best judgments and estimates.
Our consolidated financial statements have been audited by KPMGLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who have expressed their opinion with respect to the fairness of the consolidated financial statements. Their audit was conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Based on our evaluation under the framework of COSO, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December31, 2012. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December31, 2012 has been audited by KPMGLLP, as stated in their report which is included herein.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of independent directors who are not officers or employees. The Committee meets periodically with the external auditors, internal auditors and management. The Committee considers the independence of the external auditors and the audit scope and discusses internal control, financial and reporting matters. Both the external and internal auditors have free access to the Committee.

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary March1, 2013 82 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders CenturyLink,Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CenturyLink,Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and stockholders' equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2012. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March1, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
/s/ KPMG LLP Shreveport, Louisiana March1, 2013 83 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders CenturyLink,Inc.: We have audited CenturyLink,Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and stockholders' equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2012, and our report dated March1, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to "CenturyLink," "we," "us" and "our" refer to CenturyLink,Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including SAVVIS,Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (referred to as "Savvis") for periods on or after July15, 2011 and Qwest Communications InternationalInc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (referred to as "Qwest") for periods on or after April1, 2011.
(1)Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation We are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services to our residential, business, governmental and wholesale customers. Our communications services include local and long-distance, network access, private line (including special access), public access, broadband, data, managed hosting (including cloud hosting), colocation, wireless and video services. In certain local and regional markets, we also provide local access and fiber transport services to competitive local exchange carriers and security monitoring.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our subsidiaries over which we exercise control. These subsidiaries include our acquisition of SAVVIS,Inc. ("Savvis") on July15, 2011 and Qwest Communications InternationalInc. ("Qwest") on April1, 2011. See Note2Acquisitions for additional information. All intercompany amounts and transactions with our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated.
Effective January1, 2012, we changed our rates of capitalized labor as we transitioned certain of Qwest's legacy systems to our historical company systems. This transition resulted in an estimated $40million to $55million increase in the amount of labor capitalized as an asset compared to the amount that would have been capitalized if Qwest had continued to use its legacy systems and a corresponding estimated $40million to $55million decrease in operating expenses for the year ended December31, 2012. The reduction in expenses described above, net of tax, increased net income approximately $25million to $34million, or $0.04 to $0.05 per basic and diluted common share, for the year ended December31, 2012.
Effective January1, 2012, we changed our estimates of the remaining useful lives and net salvage value for certain telecommunications equipment. These changes resulted in additional depreciation expense of approximately $26million for the year ended December31, 2012. This additional depreciation expense, net of tax, reduced net income by approximately $16million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted common share, for the year ended December31, 2012.
On April2, 2012, our subsidiary, Qwest Corporation ("QC"), sold an office building for net proceeds of $133million. As part of the transaction, QC agreed to lease a portion of the building from the new owner. As a result, the $16million gain from the sale was deferred and will be recognized as a reduction to rent expense over the 10year lease term.
We also have reclassified certain other prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, including the categorization of our revenues and our segment reporting. See Note13Segment Information for additional information. These changes had no impact on total revenues, total operating expenses or net income for any period.
90 Table of Contents Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions we made when accounting for items and matters such as, but not limited to, investments, long-term contracts, customer retention patterns, allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation, amortization, asset valuations, internal labor capitalization rates, recoverability of assets (including deferred tax assets), impairment assessments, pension, post-retirement and other post-employment benefits, taxes, certain liabilities and other provisions and contingencies are reasonable, based on information available at the time they were made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and components of stockholders' equity as of the dates of the consolidated balance sheets, as well as the reported amounts of revenue, expenses and components of cash flows during the periods presented in our consolidated statements of operations, our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income and our consolidated statements of cash flows. We also make estimates in our assessments of potential losses in relation to threatened or pending tax and legal matters. See Note12Income Taxes and Note15Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.
For matters not related to income taxes, if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we recognize an expense for the estimated loss. If we have the potential to recover a portion of the estimated loss from a third party, we make a separate assessment of recoverability and reduce the estimated loss if recovery is also deemed probable.
For matters related to income taxes, if the impact of an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority, then we recognize a benefit for the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest is recognized on the amount of unrecognized benefit from uncertain tax positions.
For all of these and other matters, actual results could differ from our estimates.
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for services when the related services are provided. Recognition of certain payments received in advance of services being provided is deferred until the service is provided. These advance payments include activation and installation charges, which we recognize as revenue over the expected customer relationship period, which ranges from eighteen months to over ten years depending on the service. We also defer costs for customer activations and installations. The deferral of customer activation and installation costs is limited to the amount of revenue deferred on advance payments. Costs in excess of advance payments are recorded as expense in the period such costs are incurred. Expected customer relationship periods are estimated using historical experience. Termination fees or other fees on existing contracts that are negotiated in conjunction with new contracts are deferred and recognized over the new contract term.
We offer bundle discounts to our customers who receive certain groupings of services. These bundle discounts are recognized concurrently with the associated revenues and are allocated to the various services in the bundled offering based on the estimated selling price of services included in each bundled combination.
Customer arrangements that include both equipment and services are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable. If the elements are deemed separable and separate earnings processes exist, the revenue associated with each element is allocated to each element based on the relative estimated selling price of the separate elements. We have estimated the selling prices of each 91 Table of Contents element by reference to vendor-specific objective evidence of selling prices when the elements are sold separately. The revenue associated with each element is then recognized as earned. For example, if we receive an advance payment when we sell equipment and continuing service together, we immediately recognize as revenue the amount allocated to the equipment as long as all the conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied. The portion of the advance payment allocated to the service based upon its relative selling price is recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period.
We have periodically transferred optical capacity assets on our network to other telecommunications service carriers. These transactions are structured as indefeasible rights of use, commonly referred to as IRUs, which are the exclusive right to use a specified amount of capacity or fiber for a specified term, typically 20years. We account for the cash consideration received on transfers of optical capacity assets and on all of the other elements deliverable under an IRU, as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement. We have not recognized revenue on any contemporaneous exchanges of our optical capacity assets for other optical capacity assets.
We offer some products and services that are provided by third-party vendors. We review the relationship between us, the vendor and the end customer to assess whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis. In assessing whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis, we consider whether we act as a principal in the transaction, take title to the products, have risk and rewards of ownership or act as an agent or broker. Based on our agreements with DIRECTV and Verizon Wireless, we offer these services through sales agency relationships which are reported on a net basis.
For our data hosting operations, we have service level commitments pursuant to contracts with certain of our clients. To the extent that such service levels are not achieved or are otherwise disputed due to performance or service issues or other service interruptions or conditions, we will estimate the amount of credits to be issued and record a reduction to revenue, with a corresponding increase in the credit reserve.
USF, Gross Receipts Taxes and Other Surcharges In determining whether to include in our revenue and expenses the taxes and surcharges collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities, including USF charges, sales, use, value added and some excise taxes, we assess, among other things, whether we are the primary obligor or principal taxpayer for the taxes assessed in each jurisdiction where we do business. In jurisdictions where we determine that we are the principal taxpayer, we record the surcharges on a gross basis and include them in our revenue and costs of services and products. In jurisdictions where we determine that we are merely a collection agent for the government authority, we record the taxes on a net basis and do not include them in our revenue and costs of services and products.
Advertising Costs Costs related to advertising are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, our advertising expense was $189million, $275million and $49million, respectively.
Legal Costs In the normal course of our business, we incur costs to hire and retain external legal counsel to advise us on regulatory, litigation and other matters. We expense these costs as the related services are received.
92 Table of Contents Income Taxes We filea consolidated federal income tax return with our eligible subsidiaries. The provision for income taxes consists of an amount for taxes currently payable, an amount for tax consequences deferred to future periods, adjustments to our liabilities for uncertain tax positions and amortization of investment tax credits. We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflecting future tax consequences attributable to tax net operating losses ("NOLs"), tax credit carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax bases of those assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are computed using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be recovered. A significant portion of our net deferred tax assets relate to tax benefits attributable to NOLs. Each quarter we evaluate the need to retain all or a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. At December31, 2012, we had established a $281million valuation allowance, primarily related to state NOLs, as it is more likely than not that this amount will not be utilized prior to expiration. See Note12Income Taxes for additional information.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and are not subject to significant risk from fluctuations in interest rates. As a result, the value at which cash and cash equivalents are reported in our consolidated financial statements approximates their fair value. In evaluating investments for classification as cash equivalents, we require that individual securities have original maturities of ninety days or less and that individual investment funds have dollar-weighted average maturities of ninety days or less. To preserve capital and maintain liquidity, we invest with financial institutions we deem to be of sound financial condition and in high quality and relatively risk-free investment products. Our cash investment policy limits the concentration of investments with specific financial institutions or among certain products and includes criteria related to credit worthiness of any particular financial institution.
Book overdrafts occur when checks have been issued but have not been presented to our controlled disbursement bank accounts for payment. Disbursement bank accounts allow us to delay funding of issued checks until the checks are presented for payment. Until the issued checks are presented for payment, the book overdrafts are included in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheet. This activity is included in the operating activities section in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are recognized based upon the amount due from customers for the services provided or at cost for purchased and other receivables less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence. We generally consider our accounts past due if they are outstanding over 30days. Our collection process varies by the customer segment, amount of the receivable, and our evaluation of the customer's credit risk. Our past due accounts are written off against our allowance for doubtful accounts when collection is considered to be not probable. Any recoveries of accounts previously written off are generally recognized as a reduction in bad debt 93 Table of Contents expense in the period received. The carrying value of accounts receivable net of the allowance for doubtful accounts approximates fair value.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisitions was recorded based on its estimated fair value as of its acquisition date plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required retirement obligations. Property, plant and equipment purchased subsequent to our acquisitions is recorded at cost plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required retirement obligations. Property, plant and equipment is depreciated primarily using the straight-line group method. Under the straight-line group method, assets dedicated to providing telecommunications services (which comprise the majority of our property, plant and equipment) that have similar physical characteristics, use and expected useful lives are categorized in the year acquired on the basis of equal life groups for purposes of depreciation and tracking. Generally, under the straight-line group method, when an asset is sold or retired in the course of normal business activities, the cost is deducted from property, plant and equipment and charged to accumulated depreciation without recognition of a gain or loss. A gain or loss is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations only if a disposal is abnormal or unusual. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the expected lease term. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Interest is capitalized during the construction phase of network and other internal-use capital projects. Employee-related costs for construction of network and other internal use assets are also capitalized during the construction phase. Property, plant and equipment supplies used internally are carried at average cost, except for significant individual items for which cost is based on specific identification.
We perform annual internal reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of the depreciable lives for our property, plant and equipment. Our reviews utilize models that take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, assumptions about technology evolution and, in certain instances, actuarially determined probabilities to estimate the remaining life of our asset base.
We have asset retirement obligations associated with the legally or contractually required removal of a limited group of property, plant and equipment assets from leased properties and the disposal of certain hazardous materials present in our owned properties. When an asset retirement obligation is identified, usually in association with the acquisition of the asset, we record the fair value of the obligation as a liability. The fair value of the obligation is also capitalized as property, plant and equipment and then amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the associated asset. Where the removal obligation is not legally binding, the net cost to remove assets is expensed in the period in which the costs are actually incurred.
We review long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. For measurement purposes, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities, absent a material change in operations. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Recoverability of the asset group to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the asset group's carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. We determine fair values by using a combination of comparable market values and discounted cash flows, as appropriate.
94 Table of Contents Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as goodwill, customer relationships, capitalized software, trademarks and trade names, are initially recorded at estimated fair value. We amortize customer relationships primarily over an estimated life of 10years to 12.5years, using either the sum-of-the-years-digits or straight-line methods, depending on the type of customer. We amortize capitalized software using the straight-line method over estimated lives ranging up to seven years and amortize our other intangible assets predominantly using the sum-of-the-years digits method over an estimated life of four years. Other intangible assets not arising from business combinations are initially recorded at cost. Where there are no legal, regulatory, contractual or other factors that would reasonably limit the useful life of an intangible asset, we classify the intangible asset as indefinite-lived and such intangible assets are not amortized.
Internally used software, whether purchased or developed by us, is capitalized and amortized using the straight-line group method over its estimated useful life. We have capitalized certain costs associated with software such as costs of employees devoting time to the projects and external direct costs for materials and services. Costs associated with software to be used for internal purposes are expensed until the point at which the project has reached the development stage. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. Software maintenance, data conversion and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. We review the remaining economic lives of our capitalized software annually. Capitalized software is included in other intangible assets, net, in our consolidated balance sheets.
Our long-lived intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually, or, under certain circumstances, more frequently, such as when events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. These assets are carried at historical cost if their estimated fair value is greater than their carrying amounts. However, if their estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount, other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reduced to their estimated fair value through an impairment charge to our consolidated statements of operations. We early adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2012-2, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment, during the fourth quarter of 2012, which allows us the option to first review qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of whether the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired before performing a qualitative impairment test. Under this approach, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we are required to compute and compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount to determine and measure the impairment loss, if any. We completed our qualitative assessment as of December31, 2012 and concluded it is not more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired; thus, no impairment charge was recorded in 2012.
We are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. We are required to write-down the value of goodwill in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Our reporting units, which we refer to as our segments, are not discrete legal entities with discrete financial statements. Our assets and liabilities are employed in and relate to the operations of multiple reporting units. Therefore, the equity carrying value and future cash flows must be estimated each time a goodwill impairment analysis is performed on a reporting unit. As a result, our assets, liabilities and cash flows are allocated to reporting units using reasonable and consistent allocation methodologies. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions are required to perform these allocations. We believe these estimates, judgments and assumptions to be reasonable, but changes in many of these can significantly affect each reporting unit's equity carrying value and future cash flows utilized for our goodwill impairment test. Our annual measurement date for testing goodwill impairment is September30. As of September30, 2012, we tested for goodwill impairment on our reporting units, 95 Table of Contents which are our four operating segments (regional markets, wholesale markets, enterprise marketsnetwork and enterprise marketsdata hosting) that we recognized following our internal reorganization effective April1, 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed our annual impairment testing and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of September30, 2012. See Note3Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets for additional information.
We are required to reassign goodwill to reporting units each time we reorganize our internal reporting structure which causes a change in our operating segments. Goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units using a relative fair value approach. We utilize the earnings before interest, tax and depreciation as our allocation methodology as it represents a reasonable proxy for the fair value of the operations being reorganized.
We periodically review the estimated lives and methods used to amortize our other intangible assets. The actual amounts of amortization expense may differ materially from our estimates, depending on the results of our periodic reviews.
Pension and Post-Retirement Benefits We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and post-retirement plans as an asset or a liability on our balance sheet. Each year's actuarial gains or losses are a component of our other comprehensive (loss) income, which is then included in our accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Pension and post-retirement benefit expenses are recognized over the period in which the employee renders service and becomes eligible to receive benefits. We make significant assumptions (including the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and health care trend rates) in computing the pension and post-retirement benefits expense and obligations. See Note8Employee Benefits for additional information.
Foreign Currency Our results of operations include foreign subsidiaries, which are translated from the applicable functional currency to the United States Dollar using the average exchange rates during the reporting period, while assets and liabilities are translated at the reporting date. Resulting gains or losses from translating foreign currency are a component of our other comprehensive (loss) income, which is then included in our accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, our foreign currency translation gain (loss), net of tax, was $6million, $(15)million and $-0-million, respectively.
Common Stock At December31, 2012, we had unissued shares of CenturyLink common stock reserved of 34million shares for incentive compensation, 4million shares for acquisitions and 3million shares for our employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP").
Preferred stock Holders of outstanding CenturyLink preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends, receive preferential distributions equal to $25 per share plus unpaid dividends upon CenturyLink's liquidation and vote as a single class with the holders of common stock.
Out-of-Period Adjustments During the year ended December31, 2012, we discovered and corrected an error that resulted in an overstatement of depreciation expense in 2011. We evaluated the error considering both quantitative and qualitative factors and concluded that the error was immaterial to our previously issued and 96 Table of Contents current period consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we recognized a $30million reduction in depreciation expense during the year ended December31, 2012. The correction of the error resulted in an increase in net income of $19million, or approximately $0.03 per basic and diluted common share, for the year ended December31, 2012.
(2)Acquisitions Acquisition of Savvis On July15, 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Savvis, a provider of cloud hosting, managed hosting, colocation and network services in domestic and foreign markets. We believe this acquisition enhances our ability to be an information technology partner with our existing business customers and strengthens our opportunities to attract new business customers in the future. Each share of Savvis common stock outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition converted into the right to receive $30 per share in cash and 0.2479 shares of CenturyLink common stock. The aggregate consideration of $2.382billion consisted of:  cash payments of $1.732billion;  the 14.313million shares of CenturyLink common stock issued to consummate the acquisition,  the closing stock price of CenturyLink common stock at July14, 2011 of $38.54; and  the estimated net value of the pre-combination portion of certain share-based compensation awards assumed by CenturyLink of $98million, of which $33million was paid in cash.
Upon completing the acquisition, we also paid $547million to retire certain pre-existing Savvis debt and accrued interest, and paid related transaction expenses totaling $15million. The cash payments required on or about the closing date were funded using existing cash balances, which included the net proceeds from the June 2011 issuance of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2billion. See Note4Long-term Debt and Credit Facilities, for additional information about our senior notes.
We have completed our valuation of the fair value of Savvis' assets acquired and liabilities assumed, along with the related allocations to goodwill and intangible assets. The aggregate consideration paid by us exceeded the aggregate estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by $1.349billion, which we have recognized as goodwill. This goodwill is attributable to strategic benefits, including enhanced financial and operational scale, and product and market diversification that we expect to realize. None of the goodwill associated with this acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes.
97 Table of Contents The following is our assignment of the aggregate consideration: July15, 2011 (Dollarsinmillions) Cash, accounts receivable and other current assets* $ 214 Property, plant and equipment 1,367 Identifiable intangible assets Customer relationships 739 Other 51 Other noncurrent assets 27 Current liabilities, excluding current maturities of long-term debt (129 ) Current maturities of long-term debt (38 ) Long-term debt (840 ) Deferred credits and other liabilities (358 ) Goodwill 1,349 Aggregate consideration $ 2,382 * Includes estimated fair value of $90million for accounts receivable which had gross contractual value of $101million on July15, 2011. The $11million difference between the gross contractual value and the estimated fair value assigned represents our best estimate as of July15, 2011 of contractual cash flows that would not be collected.
We have retrospectively adjusted our previously reported preliminary assignment of the aggregate Savvis consideration for changes to our original estimates. These changes are the result of additional information obtained since the filing of our Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2011, which occurred during the one-year measurement period. Due to these revisions in our estimates, (i)customer relationships decreased $55million due to a decrease in our customer relationships valuation, (ii)property, plant and equipment increased $32million primarily from a revision to our valuation of our capital lease assets, and (iii)deferred credits and other liabilities decreased by $30million primarily from changes in deferred taxes. Among other minor revisions, goodwill decreased by $8million as an offset to the above-mentioned changes. The depreciation and amortization expense impact of the adjustments to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment valuations did not result in a material change to previouslyreported amounts.
Acquisition of Qwest On April1, 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Qwest, a provider of data, Internet, video and voice services nationwide and globally. We entered into this acquisition, among other things, to realize certain strategic benefits, including enhanced financial and operational scale, market diversification and leveraged combined networks. As of the acquisition date, Qwest served approximately 9.0million access lines and approximately 3.0million broadband subscribers across 14 states. Each share of Qwest common stock outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition converted into the right to receive 0.1664 shares of CenturyLink common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. The aggregate consideration was $12.273billion based on:  the 294million shares of CenturyLink common stock issued to consummate the acquisition;  the closing stock price of CenturyLink common stock at March31, 2011 of $41.55;  the estimated net value of the pre-combination portion of share-based compensation awards assumed by CenturyLink of $52million (excluding the value of restricted stock included in the number of issued shares specified above); and  cash paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of $5million.
98 Table of Contents We assumed approximately $12.7billion of long-term debt in connection with our acquisition of Qwest.
We have completed our valuation of the fair value of Qwest's assets acquired and liabilities assumed, along with the related allocations to goodwill and intangible assets. The aggregate consideration exceeded the aggregate estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by $10.123billion, which we have recognized as goodwill. This goodwill is attributable to strategic benefits, including enhanced financial and operational scale, market diversification and leveraged combined networks that we expect to realize. None of the goodwill associated with this acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes.
The following is our assignment of the aggregate consideration: April1, 2011 (Dollarsinmillions) Cash, accounts receivable and other current assets* $ 2,121 Property, plant and equipment 9,529 Identifiable intangible assets Customer relationships 7,558 Capitalized software 1,702 Other 189 Other noncurrent assets 390 Current liabilities, excluding current maturities of long-term debt (2,426 ) Current maturities of long-term debt (2,422 ) Long-term debt (10,253 ) Deferred credits and other liabilities (4,238 ) Goodwill 10,123 Aggregate consideration $ 12,273 * Includes estimated fair value of $1.194billion for accounts receivable which had gross contractual value of $1.274billion on April1, 2011. The $80million difference between the gross contractual value and the estimated fair value assigned represents our best estimate as of April1, 2011 of contractual cash flows that would not be collected.
We have retrospectively adjusted our reported assignment of the aggregate Qwest consideration for changes to our original estimates of the fair value of certain items at the acquisition date. These changes are the result of additional information obtained since the filing of our Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2011, which occurred during the one-year measurement period. Due to these revisions of our estimates, (i)identifiable intangible assets decreased due to a $67million decrease in our customer relationships valuation, (ii)property, plant and equipment decreased by $24million primarily from a revision to our valuation of our buildings, and (iii)deferred credits and other liabilities decreased by $63million primarily from a revision to one of our lease valuations and changes in tax liabilities. Among other minor revisions, goodwill increased by $17million as an offset to the above-mentioned changes. The depreciation and amortization expense impact of the adjustments to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment valuations did not result in a material change to previously reported amounts.
On the acquisition date, we assumed Qwest's contingencies. For more information on our contingencies, see Note15Commitments and Contingencies.
99 Table of Contents Acquisition-Related Expenses We have incurred operating expenses related to our acquisition of Savvis in July 2011, Qwest in April 2011 and Embarq in July 2009. The table below summarizes our expenses related to our acquisitions, which consist primarily of integration and severance expenses: YearsEndedDecember31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollarsinmillions) Acquisition-related expenses $ 83 467 145 The total amounts of these expenses are recognized in our cost of services and products and selling, general and administrative expenses.
At December31, 2012, we had incurred cumulative acquisition related expenses, consisting primarily of integration and severance related expenses, of $56million for Savvis and $464million for Qwest. In addition to the acquisition-related expenses included in the schedule for the year ended December31, 2011, transaction expenses in the amount of $16million were incurred in connection with terminating an unused loan financing commitment related to our Savvis acquisition. This amount was not considered an operating activity and therefore not included as an operating expense.
Qwest incurred cumulative pre-acquisition related expenses of $71million, including $36million in periods prior to being acquired and $35million on the date of acquisition. Savvis incurred cumulative pre-acquisition related expenses of $22million, including $3million in periods prior to being acquired and $19million on the date of acquisition. These amounts are not included in our results of operations.
References to Acquired Businesses In the discussion that follows, we refer to the incremental business activities that we now operate as a result of the Savvis acquisition and the Qwest acquisition as "Legacy Savvis" and "Legacy Qwest", respectively. References to "Legacy CenturyLink", when used to a comparison of our consolidated results for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, mean the business we operated prior to the Qwest and Savvis acquisitions.
Combined Pro Forma Operating Results (Unaudited) The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of CenturyLink as if the Qwest and Savvis acquisitions had been consummated as of January1, 2010.
YearsEndedDecember31, 2011 2010 (Dollarsinmillions) Operating revenues $ 18,692 19,431 Net income 601 293 Basic earnings per common share .97 .48 Diluted earnings per common share .97 .48 This pro forma information reflects certain adjustments to previously reported operating results, consisting of primarily:  decreased operating revenues and expenses due to the elimination of deferred revenues and deferred expenses associated with installation activities and capacity leases that were assigned no 100 Table of Contents value at the acquisition date and the elimination of transactions among CenturyLink, Qwest and Savvis that are now subject to intercompany elimination;  increased amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets, net of decreased depreciation expense to reflect the fair value of property, plant and equipment;  decreased recognition of retiree benefit expenses for Qwest due to the elimination of unrecognized actuarial losses;  decreased interest expense primarily due to the amortization of an adjustment to reflect the increased fair value of long-term debt of Qwest recognized on the acquisition date; and  the related income tax effects.
The pro forma information does not necessarily reflect the actual results of operations had the Qwest and Savvis acquisitions been consummated at January1, 2010, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results. The pro forma information does not adjust for integration costs incurred by us, Qwest and Savvis during 2011 (which are further described above in this note) or integration costs to be incurred by us in future periods. In addition, the pro forma information does not give effect to any potential revenue enhancements, cost synergies or other operating efficiencies that could result from the acquisitions (other than those realized in our historical consolidated financial statements after the respective acquisition dates).
(3)Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill, customer relationships and other intangible assets consisted of the following: December31, 2012 December31, 2011 (Dollars in millions) Goodwill $ 21,732 21,732 Customer relationships, less accumulated amortization of $2,524 and $1,337 7,052 8,239 Indefinite-life intangible assets 268 422 Other intangible assets subject to amortization Capitalized software, less accumulated amortization of $814 and $441 1,399 1,622 Trade names and patents, less accumulated amortization of $142 and $71 128 199 Total other intangible assets, net $ 1,795 2,243 Total amortization expense for intangible assets for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $1.682billion, $1.425billion and $206million, respectively.
101 Table of Contents We estimate that total amortization expense for intangible assets for the years ending December31, 2013 through 2017 will be as follows: (Dollarsinmillions) 2013 $ 1,493 2014 1,369 2015 1,232 2016 1,104 2017 983 Our goodwill was derived from numerous acquisitions whereby the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. For more information on our recent acquisitions and resulting fair values, see Note2Acquisitions. During the year ended December31, 2012, during the respective one-year measurement periods for our recent acquisitions we retrospectively adjusted our previously reported preliminary assignment of the aggregate consideration for changes to our original estimates. Due to these revisions in our estimates, goodwill increased by $8million. This adjustment to goodwill has been reflected in the balance sheets for both December31, 2012 and December31, 2011.
Effective April1, 2012, we restructured our operating segments to support our new operating structure. As a result, we reassigned goodwill to our reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach. As of December31, 2012, we attributed our goodwill balances to our segments as follows: December31, 2012 (Dollarsinmillions) Regional markets $ 15,170 Wholesale markets 3,283 Enterprise marketsnetwork 1,788 Enterprise marketsdata hosting 1,491 Total goodwill $ 21,732 We test our goodwill for impairment annually, or, under certain circumstances, more frequently, such as when events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. We are required to write down the value of goodwill only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value. Our annual measurement date for testing impairment is September30. As of September30, 2012, we tested for goodwill impairment on our reporting units, which are our four operating segments (regional markets, wholesale markets, enterprise marketsnetwork and enterprise marketsdata hosting) that we recognized following our internal reorganization in the second quarter of 2012.
We adopted the provisions of ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, in the third quarter of 2011, which permits us to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's, which we refer to as our segments, fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test, which requires us (i)in step one, to identify potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying value and (ii)in step two, to quantify any impairment identified in step one. At September30, 2012, as a result of the recent internal reorganization of our four segments we did not have a baseline valuation to perform a qualitative assessment. We estimated the fair value of our four segments using an equal weighting based on a market approach and a discounted cash flow method. The market approach includes the use of comparable multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to ours. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows and a terminal value, which represents the expected normalized cash flows of the segments beyond the cash flows from the discrete nine-year projection period. We discounted the estimated cash flows for our regional 102 Table of Contents markets, wholesale markets, and enterprise marketsnetwork segments using a rate that represents a market participant's weighted average cost of capital, which we determined to be approximately 6.0% as of the measurement date (which was comprised of an after-tax cost of debt of 3.2% and a cost of equity of 8.4%). We discounted the estimated cash flows of our enterprise marketsdata hosting segment using a rate that represents a market participant's estimated weighted average cost of capital, which we determined to be approximately 11.0% as of the measurement date (which was comprised of an after-tax cost of debt of 3.2% and a cost of equity of 12.0%). We also reconciled the estimated fair values of the segments to our market capitalization as of September30, 2012 and concluded that the indicated implied control premium of approximately 14% was reasonable based on recent transactions in the market place. Based on our analysis performed with respect to our reporting units described above, we have concluded that our goodwill is not impaired.
Our long-lived intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually, or, under certain circumstances, more frequently, such as when events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. These assets are carried at historical cost if their estimated fair value is greater than their carrying amounts. However, if their estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount, other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reduced to their estimated fair value through an impairment charge to our consolidated statements of operations. We early adopted the provisions of ASU 2012-2, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment, during the fourth quarter of 2012, which allows us the option to first review qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of whether the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired before performing a qualitative impairment test. Under this approach, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we will be required to compute and compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount to determine and measure the impairment loss, if any. We completed our qualitative assessment as of December31, 2012 and concluded it is not more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired; thus, no impairment charge was recorded in 2012.
During the second quarter of 2012, we committed to a plan to sell our Advanced Wireless Services A Block and 700 MHz wireless in the A, B, and C Blocks, which in the aggregate had a basis of $154million. We sold $58million of our wireless spectrum assets during the fourth quarter of 2012, and we sold another $43million of our wireless spectrum assets in January 2013. In the aggregate, these transactions resulted in a gain of $32million. We expect to reach agreements with various other purchasers for the remaining spectrum, and the consummation of which will be subject to regulatory approval.
103 Table of Contents (4)Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities Long-term debt, including unamortized discounts and premiums, at December31, 2012 and 2011 consisted of borrowings by CenturyLink,Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, including Qwest and Embarq Corporation ("Embarq"), as follows: December31, Interest Rates Maturities 2012 2011 (Dollarsinmillions) CenturyLink,Inc.

We used the net proceeds to fund a portion of our acquisition of Savvis and repay certain of Savvis' debt. See Note2Acquisitions for additional information. In April 2011, we received commitment letters from two banks to provide up to $2.0billion in bridge financing for the Savvis acquisition.

In June 2011, QC used the net proceeds of $642million from the June8, 2011 debt issuance, together with available cash, to redeem $825million aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% Notes due 2011 and to pay related fees and expenses, which resulted in an immaterial loss.
106 Table of Contents Credit Facilities On April6, 2012, we amended and restated our $1.7billion revolving credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount available to $2.0billion and to extend the maturity date to April 2017. This amended credit facility (the "Credit Facility") has 18 lenders, with commitments ranging from $2.5million to $181million and allows us to obtain revolving loans and to issue up to $400million of letters of credit, which will reduce the amount available for other extensions of credit. Interest is assessed on borrowings using either the LIBOR or the base rate (as defined in the Credit Facility) plus an applicable margin between 1.25% and 2.25% per annum for LIBOR loans and 0.25% and 1.25% per annum for base rate loans depending on our then current senior unsecured long-term debt rating. Our obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Embarq and QCII, and one of QCII's wholly-owned subsidiaries. In the event of a ratings decline below "investment grade" as defined, Savvis and its operating subsidiaries will become guarantors of the Credit Facility. As of December31, 2012, there was $820million outstanding under the Credit Facility.
In April 2011, we entered into a $160million uncommitted revolving letter of credit facility which enables us to provide letters of credit under terms that may be more favorable than those under the Credit Facility. At December31, 2012, our outstanding letters of credit totaled $120million under this facility.
Aggregate Maturities of Long-Term Debt Aggregate maturities of our long-term debt (excluding unamortized premiums, discounts and other): (Dollars in millions) 2013 $ 1,205 2014 781 2015 545 2016 1,488 2017 2,313 2018 and thereafter 14,255 Total long-term debt $ 20,587 Interest Expense Interest expense includes interest on long-term debt. The following table presents the amount of gross interest expense, net of capitalized interest: Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Interest expense: Gross interest expense $ 1,362 1,097 557 Capitalized interest (43 ) (25 ) (13 ) Total interest expense $ 1,319 1,072 544 107 Table of Contents Covenants Certain of our loan agreements contain various restrictions, as described more fully below. The covenants currently in place result in no significant restriction to the transfer of funds from our consolidated subsidiaries to CenturyLink.
The senior notes of CenturyLink were issued under an indenture dated March31, 1994. This indenture does not contain any financial covenants, but does include restrictions that limit our ability to (i)incur, issue or create liens upon our property and (ii)consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party. The indenture does not contain any provisions that are impacted by our credit ratings or that restrict the issuance of new securities in the event of a material adverse change to us.
The indentures governing Qwest's debt securities contain customary covenants that restrict the ability of Qwest or its subsidiaries from incurring additional debt, making certain payments and investments, granting liens, and selling or transferring assets. We do not anticipate that these covenants will significantly restrict our ability to manage cash balances or transfer cash between entities within our consolidated group of companies as needed.
Since the Qwest parent company has achieved investment grade ratings from one of the rating agencies, most of the covenants listed above have been suspended. These covenants will be reinstated if the Qwest parent company loses the investment grade rating from that agency. Under the indenture governing these notes, we must repurchase the notes upon certain changes of control, which were not triggered upon the acquisition on April1, 2011. This indenture also contains provisions for cross acceleration relating to any of our other debt obligations and the debt obligations of our restricted subsidiaries in an aggregate amount in excess of $100million.
Embarq's senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of May17, 2006. While Embarq is generally prohibited from creating liens on its property unless its senior notes are secured equally and ratably, Embarq can create liens on its property without equally and ratably securing its senior notes so long as the sum of all indebtedness so secured does not exceed 15% of Embarq's consolidated net tangible assets. The indenture contains customary events of default, none of which are impacted by Embarq's credit rating. The indenture does not contain any financial covenants or restrictions on the ability to issue new securities in accordance with the terms of the indenture.
Several of our other subsidiaries have outstanding first mortgage bonds or notes. Each issue of these first mortgage bonds or notes is secured by substantially all of the property, plant and equipment of the issuing subsidiary. Approximately 21% of our property, plant and equipment is pledged to secure the long-term debt of subsidiaries.
Under the Credit Facility, we, and our indirect subsidiary, QC, must maintain a debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined in our Credit Facility) ratio of not more than 4:1 and 2.85:1, respectively, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the four quarters then ended. The Credit Facility also contains a negative pledge covenant, which generally provides restrictions if we pledge assets or permit liens on our property, and requires that any advances under the Credit Facility must also be secured equally and ratably. The Credit Facility also has a cross payment default provision, and the Credit Facility and certain of our debt securities also have cross acceleration provisions.
At December31, 2012, we were in compliance with all of the provisions and covenants contained in our Credit Facility and other debt agreements.
108 Table of Contents (5)Accounts Receivable The following table presents details of our accounts receivable balances: December31, 2012 2011 (1) (Dollars in millions) Trade and purchased receivables $ 1,782 1,768 Earned and unbilled receivables 274 296 Other 19 31 Total accounts receivable 2,075 2,095 Less: allowance for doubtful accounts (158 ) (145 ) Accounts receivable, less allowance $ 1,917 1,950 (1) We have reclassified prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation.
We are exposed to concentrations of credit risk from residential and business customers within our local service area, business customers outside of our local service area and from other telecommunications service providers. We generally do not require collateral to secure our receivable balances. We have agreements with other telecommunications service providers whereby we agree to bill and collect on their behalf for services rendered by those providers to our customers within our local service area. We purchase accounts receivable from other telecommunications service providers primarily on a recourse basis and include these amounts in our accounts receivable balance. We have not experienced any significant loss associated with these purchased receivables.
The following table presents details of our allowance for doubtful accounts: Beginning Balance Additions Deductions Other Ending Balance (Dollars in millions) 2012 $ 145 187 (174 )  158 2011 $ 60 153 (68 )  145 2010 $ 48 91 (79 )  60 109 Table of Contents (6)Property, Plant and Equipment Net property, plant and equipment is composed of the following: December31, Depreciable Lives 2012 2011 (Dollars in millions) Land N/A $ 579 590 Fiber, conduit and other outside plant (1) 15-45years 13,030 12,415 Central office and other network electronics (2) 3-10years 11,395 9,683 Support assets (3) 3-30years 6,235 6,098 Construction in progress (4) N/A 847 799 Gross property, plant and equipment 32,086 29,585 Accumulated depreciation (13,054 ) (10,141 ) Net property, plant and equipment $ 19,032 19,444 (1) Fiber, conduit and other outside plant consists of fiber and metallic cable, conduit, poles and other supporting structures.
(2) Central office and other network electronics consists of circuit and packet switches, routers, transmission electronics and electronics providing service to customers.
(3) Support assets consist of buildings, computers and other administrative and support equipment.
(4) Construction in progress includes inventory held for construction and property of the aforementioned categories that has not been placed in service as it is still under construction.
Effective January1, 2012, we changed our rates of capitalized labor as we transitioned certain of Qwest's legacy systems to our historical company systems. This transition resulted in an estimated $40million to $55million increase in the amount of labor capitalized as an asset compared to the amount that would have been capitalized if Qwest had continued to use its legacy systems and a corresponding estimated $40million to $55million decrease in operating expenses for the year ended December31, 2012. The reduction in expenses described above, net of tax, increased net income approximately $25million to $34million, or $0.04 to $0.05 per basic and diluted common share, for the year ended December31, 2012.
Effective January1, 2012, we changed our estimates of the remaining useful lives and net salvage value for certain telecommunications equipment. These changes resulted in additional depreciation expense of approximately $26million for the year ended December31, 2012. This additional depreciation expense, net of tax, reduced net income by approximately $16million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted common share, for the year ended December31, 2012.
During the year ended December31, 2012, we discovered and corrected an error that resulted in an overstatement of depreciation expense in 2011. We evaluated the error considering both quantitative and qualitative factors and concluded that the error was immaterial to our previously issued and current period consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we recognized a $30million reduction in depreciation expense during the year ended December31, 2012. The correction of the error resulted in an increase in net income of $19million, or approximately $0.03 per basic and diluted common share, for the year ended December31, 2012.
During the first and second quarters of 2012, we retrospectively adjusted our reported preliminary assignment of the aggregate Qwest and Savvis consideration for changes to our original estimates of the fair value of buildings at the acquisition date. This retrospective adjustment increased the previously reported December31, 2011 support assets by $8million.
110 Table of Contents During 2012, we reclassified certain prior period amounts of inventory held for construction to conform to the current period presentation. This reclassification increased construction in progress at December31, 2011 by $55million with an offsetting decrease to fiber, conduit and other outside plant and central office and other network electronics by $8million and $47million, respectively.
We recorded depreciation expense of $3.098billion, $2.601billion and $1.228billion for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Asset Retirement Obligations At December31, 2012, our asset retirement obligations balance was primarily related to estimated future costs of removing equipment from leased properties and estimated future costs of properly disposing of asbestos and other hazardous materials upon remodeling or demolishing buildings. Asset retirement obligations are included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
The following table provides asset retirement obligation activity: Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Balance at beginning of year $ 109 41 39 Accretion expense 7 9 2 Liabilities incurred 1   Liabilities assumed in Qwest and Savvis acquisitions  124  Liabilities settled and other (1 ) (3 )  Change in estimate (10 ) (62 )  Balance at end of year $ 106 109 41 During 2012 and 2011, we revised our estimates for the cost of removal of network equipment, asbestos remediation, and other obligations by $10million and $62million, respectively. These revisions resulted in a reduction of the asset retirement obligation and offsetting reduction to gross property, plant and equipment.
(7)Severance and Leased Real Estate Periodically, we have reductions in our workforce and have accrued liabilities for related severance costs. These workforce reductions resulted primarily from the progression or completion of our integration plans, increased competitive pressures and reduced workload demands due to the loss of access lines.
We report severance liabilities within accrued expenses and other liabilities-salaries and benefits in our consolidated balance sheets and report severance expenses in cost of services and products and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We have not allocated any severance expense to our regional, enterprise and wholesale markets segments.
In periods prior to our acquisition of Qwest, Qwest had ceased using certain real estate that it was leasing under long-term operating leases. As of the April1, 2011 acquisition date, we recognized liabilities to reflect our preliminary estimates of the fair values of the existing lease obligations for real estate for which we had ceased using, net of estimated sublease rentals. Our fair value estimates were determined using discounted cash flow methods. We recognize expense to reflect accretion of the discounted liabilities and periodically, we adjust the expense when our actual experience differs from 111 Table of Contents our initial estimates. We report the current portion of liabilities for ceased-use real estate leases in accrued expenses and other liabilities and report the noncurrent portion in deferred credits and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We report the related expenses in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. At December31, 2012, the current and noncurrent portions of our leased real estate accrual were $19million and $112million, respectively. The remaining lease terms range from 0.1 to 13.0years, with a weighted average of 9.0years.
Changes in our accrued liabilities for severance expenses and leased real estate were as follows: Severance Real Estate (Dollars in millions) Balance at December31, 2010 $ 18  Accrued to expense 132 6 Liabilities assumed in Qwest acquisition 20 168 Payments, net (133 ) (21 ) Balance at December31, 2011 37 153 Accrued to expense 96 2 Payments, net (113 ) (24 ) Reversals and adjustments (3 )  Balance at December31, 2012 $ 17 131 Our severance expenses for the year ended December31, 2011 included $12million of share-based compensation associated with the accelerated vesting of stock awards that occurred in connection with workforce reductions relating to the acquisition of Qwest.
(8)Employee Benefits Pension, Post-Retirement and Other Post-Employment Benefits We sponsor several defined benefit pension plans, which in the aggregate cover a substantial portion of our employees including separate plans for Legacy CenturyLink, Legacy Qwest and Legacy Embarq employees. Until such time as we elect to integrate the Qwest and Embarq benefit plans with ours, we plan to continue to operate these plans independently. Pension benefits for participants of these plans who are represented by a collective bargaining agreement are based on negotiated schedules. All other participants' pension benefits are based on each individual participant's years of service and compensation. We use a December31 measurement date for all our plans. In addition to these tax qualified pension plans, we also maintain non-qualified pension plans for certain former highly compensated employees. We maintain post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees. We also provide other post-employment benefits for eligible former employees.
Pension In connection with the acquisition of Qwest on April1, 2011, we assumed defined benefit pension plans sponsored by Qwest for its employees. Based on a valuation analysis, we recognized a $490million net liability at April1, 2011 for the unfunded status of the Qwest pension plans, reflecting projected benefit obligations of $8.3billion in excess of the $7.8billion fair value of plan assets.
Current funding laws require a company with a plan shortfall to fund the annual cost of benefits earned in addition to a seven-year amortization of the shortfall. Our funding policy for the pension plans is to make contributions with the objective of accumulating sufficient assets to pay all qualified 112 Table of Contents pension benefits when due under the terms of the plans. The accounting unfunded status of our qualified pension plans was $2.5billion as of December31, 2012.
We made cash contributions of approximately $32million in 2012 to our qualified pension plans. During the first quarter of 2013, we made a series of cash contributions totaling $147million to our qualified pension plans. Based on current laws and circumstances, we do not expect any further required contributions to these plans for the remainder of 2013.
In 2010, to align our benefit structure closer to those offered by our competitors, we froze our Legacy CenturyLink and Legacy Embarq pension benefit accruals for our non-represented employees at December31, 2010. Such action resulted in a reduction of our benefit obligation of approximately $110million and resulted in the recognition of a curtailment gain of approximately $21million in 2010. Prior to their acquisition on April1, 2011, Qwest had frozen its pension benefit accruals for non-represented employees.
Other Post-Retirement Benefits Our post-retirement health care plans provide post-retirement benefits to qualified retirees. The post-retirement health care plans we assumed as part of our acquisitions of Qwest and Embarq provide post-retirement benefits to qualified retirees and allow (i)eligible employees retiring before certain dates to receive benefits at no or reduced cost and (ii)eligible employees retiring after certain dates to receive benefits on a shared cost basis. The post-retirement health care plans are primarily funded by us and we expect to continue funding these post-retirement obligations as benefits are paid. Our plans use a December31 measurement date.
In connection with the acquisition of Qwest on April1, 2011, we assumed post-retirement benefit plans sponsored by Qwest for certain of its employees. At April1, 2011, we recognized a $2.5billion liability for the unfunded status of Qwest's post-retirement benefit plans, reflecting estimated accumulated post-retirement benefit obligations of $3.3billion in excess of the $762million fair value of the plan assets.
No contributions were made to the post-retirement trusts in 2012 or 2011, and we do not expect to make a contribution in 2013.
A change of 100 basis points in the assumed initial health care cost trend rate would have had the following effects in 2012: 100 Basis Points Change Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic post-retirement benefit expense (statement of operations) $ 3 (3 ) Effect on benefit obligation (balance sheet) 77 (70 ) We expect our health care cost trend rate to decrease by 0.25% per year from 6.75% in 2013 to an ultimate rate of 4.50% in 2022. Our post-retirement health care expense, for certain eligible Legacy Qwest retirees and certain eligible Legacy CenturyLink retirees, is capped at a set dollar amount. Therefore, those health care benefit obligations are not subject to increasing health care trends after the effective date of the caps.
113 Table of Contents Expected Cash Flows The qualified pension, non-qualified pension and post-retirement health care benefit payments and premiums and life insurance premium payments are paid by us or distributed from plan assets. The estimated benefit payments provided below are based on actuarial assumptions using the demographics of the employee and retiree populations and have been reduced by estimated participant contributions.

Plan Assets We maintain plan assets for our qualified pension plans and certain post-retirement benefit plans. The qualified pension plan assets are used for the payment of pension benefits and certain eligible plan expenses. The post-retirement benefit plan's assets are used to pay health care benefits and premiums on behalf of eligible retirees and to pay certain eligible plan expenses. The expected rate of return on plan assets is the long-term rate of return we expect to earn on the plans' assets. The rate of return is determined by the strategic allocation of plan assets and the long-term risk and return forecast for each asset class. The forecasts for each asset class are generated primarily from an analysis of the long-term expectations of various third party investment management organizations. The expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised, as necessary, to reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy. The following tables summarize the change in the fair value of plan assets for the pension and post-retirement benefit plans: Pension Plans Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 11,814 3,732 3,220 Return on plan assets 1,476 479 483 Acquisitions  7,777  Employer contributions 32 587 300 Settlements    Benefits paid from plan assets (1,001 ) (761 ) (271 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 12,321 11,814 3,732 117 Table of Contents Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 693 54 57 Actual gain on plan assets 80 4 6 Acquisitions  768  Employer contributions    Participant contributions    Benefits paid from plan assets (147 ) (133 ) (9 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 626 693 54 Pension Plans: Our investment objective for the pension plan assets is to achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return over time that will provide for the payment of benefits and minimize the risk of large losses. Our pension plan investment strategy is designed to meet this objective by broadly diversifying plan assets across numerous strategies with differing expected returns, volatilities and correlations. The pension plan assets have target allocations of 55% to interest rate sensitive investments and 45% to investments designed to provide higher expected returns than the interest rate sensitive investments. Interest rate sensitive investments include 35% of plan assets targeted primarily to long-duration investment grade bonds, 13.5% targeted to high yield, emerging market bonds and convertible bonds and 6.5% targeted to diversified strategies, which primarily have exposures to global government, corporate and inflation-linked bonds, as well as some exposures to global stocks and commodities. Assets expected to provide higher returns than the interest rate sensitive assets include broadly diversified equity investments with targets of approximately 14% to U.S. stocks and 14% to developed and emerging market non-U.S. stocks. Approximately 12% is allocated to other private markets investments including funds primarily invested in private equity, debt and hedge funds. Real estate investments are targeted at 5% of plan assets. At the beginning of 2013, our expected annual long-term rate of return on pension assets is assumed to be 7.5%.
Post-Retirement Benefit Plans: Our investment objective for the post-retirement benefit plan assets is to achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return and minimize the risk of large losses over the expected life of the assets. Investment risk is managed by broadly diversifying assets across numerous strategies with differing expected returns, volatilities and correlations. Our investment strategy is designed to be consistent with the investment objective, with particular focus on providing liquidity for the reimbursement of our union-represented employees post-retirement health care costs. The post-retirement benefit plan assets have target allocations of 35% to equities and 65% to non-equity investments. Specific target allocations within these broad categories are allowed to vary to provide liquidity in order to meet reimbursement requirements. Equity investments are broadly diversified with exposure to publicly traded U.S., non-U.S. and emerging market stocks and private equity. While no new private equity investments have been made in recent years, the percent allocation to existing private equity investments is expected to increase as liquid, publicly traded stocks are drawn down for the reimbursement of health care costs. The 65% non-equity allocation includes investment grade bonds, high yield bonds, convertible bonds, emerging market debt, real estate, hedge funds, private debt and diversified strategies. At the beginning of 2013, our expected annual long-term rate of return on post-retirement benefit plan assets is assumed to be 7.5%.
Permitted investments: Plan assets are managed consistent with the restrictions set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, which requires diversification of assets and also generally prohibits defined benefit and welfare plans from investing more than 10% of their 118 Table of Contents assets in securities issued by the sponsor company. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the pension and post-retirement benefit plans did not directly own any shares of our common stock or any of our debt.
Derivative instruments: Derivative instruments are used to reduce risk as well as provide return. The pension and post-retirement benefit plans use exchange traded futures to gain exposure to equity and Treasury markets consistent with target asset allocations. Interest rate swaps are used in the pension plans to reduce risk relative to measurement of the benefit obligation, which is sensitive to interest rate changes. Foreign exchange forward contracts and total return swaps are used primarily to manage currency exposures. Credit default swaps are used to manage credit risk exposures in a cost effective and targeted manner relative to transacting with physical corporate fixed income securities. Options are currently used to manage interest rate exposure taking into account the implied volatility and current pricing of the specific underlying market instrument. Some derivative instruments subject the plans to counterparty risk. We closely monitor counterparty exposure and mitigate this risk by diversifying the exposure among multiple high credit quality counterparties, requiring collateral and limiting exposure by periodically settling contracts.
The gross notional exposure of the derivative instruments directly held by the plans is shown below. The notional amount of the derivatives corresponds to market exposure but does not represent an actual cash investment.

We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value and then we rank the estimated values based on the reliability of the inputs used following the fair value hierarchy set forth by the FASB. For additional information on the fair value hierarchy, see Note11Fair Value Disclosure.
At December31, 2012, we used the following valuation techniques to measure fair value for assets. There were no changes to these methodologies during 2012:  Level1Assets were valued using the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security was traded.
119 Table of Contents  Level2Assets were valued using quoted prices in markets that are not active, broker dealer quotations, net asset value of shares held by the plans and other methods by which all significant input were observable at the measurement date.
Level3Assets were valued using unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists as reported by the respective institutions at the measurement date.
The tables below presents the fair value of plan assets by category and the input levels used to determine those fair values at December31, 2012. It is important to note that the asset allocations do not include market exposures that are gained with derivatives.

For several of the investments in the tables above and discussed below, the plans own units in commingled funds and limited partnerships that invest in various types of assets. Interests in commingled funds are valued using the net asset value ("NAV") per unit of each fund. The NAV reported by the fund manager is based on the market value of the underlying investments owned by each fund, minus its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. Commingled funds held by the plans that can be redeemed at NAV within a year of the financial statement date are generally classified as Level2. Investments in limited partnerships represent long-term commitments with a fixed maturity date, typically ten years. Valuation inputs for these limited partnership interests are generally based on assumptions and other information not observable in the market and are classified as Level3 investments. The assumptions and valuation methodologies of the pricing vendors, account managers, fund managers and partnerships are monitored and evaluated for reasonableness. Below is an overview of the asset categories, the underlying strategies and valuation inputs used to value the assets in the preceding tables: (a) Investment grade bonds represent investments in fixed income securities as well as commingled bond funds comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, agencies, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Treasury securities are valued at the bid price reported in the active market in which the security is traded and are classified as Level1. The valuation inputs of other investment grade bonds primarily utilize observable market information and are based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities and consider yields available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. The primary observable inputs include references to the new issue market for similar securities, the secondary trading markets and dealer quotes. Option adjusted spread models are 123 Table of Contents utilized to evaluate securities such as asset backed securities that have early redemption features. These securities are classified as Level2. The commingled funds are valued at NAV based on the market value of the underlying fixed income securities using the same valuation inputs described above. The commingled funds can be redeemed at NAV within a year of the financial statement date and are classified as Level2.
(b) High yield bonds represent investments in below investment grade fixed income securities as well as commingled high yield bond funds. The valuation inputs for the securities primarily utilize observable market information and are based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities and consider yields available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. These securities are classified as Level2. The commingled funds are valued at NAV based on the market value of the underlying high yield instruments using the same valuation inputs described above. Commingled funds that can be redeemed at NAV within a year of the financial statement date are classified as Level2. Commingled funds that cannot be redeemed at NAV or that cannot be redeemed at NAV within a year of the financial statement date are classified as Level3.
(c) Emerging market bonds represent investments in securities issued by governments and other entities located in developing countries as well as commingled emerging market bond funds. The valuation inputs for the securities utilize observable market information and are primarily based on dealer quotes or a spread relative to the local government bonds.

The commingled funds can be redeemed at NAV within a year of the financial statement date and are classified as Level2.
(d) Convertible bonds primarily represent investments in corporate debt securities that have features that allow the debt to be converted into equity securities under certain circumstances. The valuation inputs for the individual convertible bonds primarily utilize observable market information including a spread to U.S. Treasuries and the value and volatility of the underlying equity security. Convertible bonds are classified as Level2.
(e) Diversified strategies represent an investment in a commingled fund that primarily has exposures to global government, corporate and inflation linked bonds, global stocks and commodities. The commingled fund is valued at NAV based on the market value of the underlying investments. The valuation inputs utilize observable market information including published prices for exchange traded securities, bid prices for government bonds, and spreads and yields available for comparable fixed income securities with similar credit ratings. This fund can be redeemed at NAV within a year of the financial statement date and is classified as Level2.
(f) U.S. stocks represent investments in stocks of U.S. based companies as well as commingled U.S. stock funds. The valuation inputs for U.S. stocks are based on the last published price reported on the major stock market on which the securities are traded and are classified as Level1. The commingled funds are valued at NAV based on the market value of the underlying investments using the same valuation inputs described above. These commingled funds can be redeemed at NAV within a year of the financial statement date and are classified as Level2.
(g) Non-U.S. stocks represent investments in stocks of companies based in developed countries outside the U.S. as well as commingled funds. The valuation inputs for non-U.S. stocks are based on the last published price reported on the major stock market on which the securities are traded and are classified as Level1.

The commingled funds are valued at NAV based on the market value of the underlying investments using the same valuation inputs described previously for individual stocks. These commingled funds can be redeemed at NAV within a year of the financial statement date and are classified as Level2.
(i) Private equity represents non-public investments in domestic and foreign buy out and venture capital funds. Private equity funds are structured as limited partnerships and are valued according to the valuation policy of each partnership, subject to prevailing accounting and other regulatory guidelines. The partnerships use valuation methodologies that give consideration to a range of factors, including but not limited to the price at which investments were acquired, the nature of the investments, market conditions, trading values on comparable public securities, current and projected operating performance, and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investments. These valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of judgment. Private equity investments are classified as Level3.
(j) Private debt represents non-public investments in distressed or mezzanine debt funds. Mezzanine debt instruments are debt instruments that are subordinated to other debt issues and may include embedded equity instruments such as warrants. Private debt funds are structured as limited partnerships and are valued according to the valuation policy of each partnership, subject to prevailing accounting and other regulatory guidelines. The valuation of underlying fund investments are based on factors including the issuer's current and projected credit worthiness, the security's terms, reference to the securities of comparable companies, and other market factors. These valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of judgment. Private debt investments are classified as Level3.
(k) Market neutral hedge funds hold investments in a diversified mix of instruments that are intended in combination to exhibit low correlations to market fluctuations. These investments are typically combined with futures to achieve uncorrelated excess returns over various markets.
Directional hedge funds This asset category represents investments that may exhibit somewhat higher correlations to market fluctuations than the market neutral hedge funds. Investments in hedge funds include both direct investments and investments in diversified funds of funds. Hedge Funds are valued at NAV based on the market value of the underlying investments which include publicly traded equity and fixed income securities and privately negotiated debt securities. The hedge funds are valued by third party administrators using the same valuation inputs previously described. Hedge funds that can be redeemed at NAV within a year of the financial statement date are classified as Level2. Hedge fund investments that cannot be redeemed at NAV or that cannot be redeemed at NAV within a year of the financial statement date are classified as Level3.
(l) Real estate represents investments in commingled funds and limited partnerships that invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate properties. These investments are valued at NAV according to the valuation policy of each fund or partnership, subject to prevailing accounting and other regulatory guidelines. The valuation inputs of the underlying properties are generally based on third-party appraisals that use comparable sales or a projection of future cash flows to determine fair value. Real estate investments that can be redeemed at NAV within a year of the financial statement date are classified as Level2. Real estate investments that cannot be redeemed at NAV or that cannot be redeemed at NAV within a year of the financial statement date are classified as Level3.
(m) Derivatives include the market value of exchange traded futures contracts which are classified as Level1, as well as privately negotiated over-the-counter swaps that are valued based 125 Table of Contents on the change in interest rates or a specific market index and classified as Level2. The market values represent gains or losses that occur due to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, security prices, or other factors.
(n) Cash equivalents and short-term investments represent investments that are used in conjunction with derivatives positions or are used to provide liquidity for the payment of benefits or other purposes. U.S. Treasury Bills are valued at the bid price reported in the active market in which the security is traded and are classified as Level1. The valuation inputs of other securities are based on a spread to U.S. Treasury Bills, the Federal Funds Rate, or London Interbank Offered Rate and consider yields available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings and are classified as Level2. The commingled funds are valued at NAV based on the market value of the underlying investments using the same valuation inputs described above. These commingled funds can be redeemed at NAV within a year of the financial statement date and are classified as Level2.
Concentrations of Risk: Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as significant world events, interest rate, credit, foreign currency and overall market volatility risk. These risks are managed by broadly diversifying assets across numerous asset classes and strategies with differing expected returns, volatilities and correlations. Risk is also broadly diversified across numerous market sectors and individual companies. Financial instruments that potentially subject the plans to concentrations of counterparty risk consist principally of investment contracts with high quality financial institutions. These investment contracts are typically collateralized obligations and/or are actively managed, limiting the amount of counterparty exposure to any one financial institution. Although the investments are well diversified, the value of plan assets could change materially depending upon the overall market volatility, which could affect the funded status of the plans.

For the year ended December31, 2012, the investment program produced actual gains on qualified pension and post-retirement plan assets of $1.555billion as compared to the expected returns of $892million for a difference of $663million. For the year ended December31, 2011, the investment program produced actual gains on pension and post-retirement plan assets of $483million as compared to the expected returns of $750million for a difference of $267million. The short-term annual returns on plan assets will almost always be different from the expected long-term returns and the plans could experience net gains or losses, due primarily to the volatility occurring in the financial markets during any given year.
128 Table of Contents Unfunded Status The following table presents the unfunded status of the pensions and post-retirement benefit plans: Pension Plans Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Years Ended December31, Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 2012 2011 (Dollars in millions) Benefit obligation $ (14,881 ) (13,596 ) (4,075 ) (3,930 ) Fair value of plan assets 12,321 11,814 626 693 Unfunded status (2,560 ) (1,782 ) (3,449 ) (3,237 ) Current portion of unfunded status $ (6 )  (160 ) (164 ) Non-current portion of unfunded status $ (2,554 ) (1,782 ) (3,289 ) (3,073 ) The current portion of our post-retirement benefit obligations is recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in accrued expenses and other current liabilitiessalaries and benefits.

We recognize the impact of the federal subsidy received under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 in the calculation of our post-retirement benefit obligation and net periodic post-retirement benefit expense.
130 Table of Contents Other Benefit Plans Health Care and Life Insurance We provide health care and life insurance benefits to essentially all of our active employees. We are largely self-funded for the cost of the health care plan. Our health care benefit expenses for current employees were $360million, $377million and $190million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Union-represented employee benefits are based on negotiated collective bargaining agreements. Employees contributed $113million, $90million and $47million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our group life insurance plans are fully insured and the premiums are paid by us.
401(k) Plan We sponsor qualified defined contribution benefit plans covering substantially all of our employees. Under these plans, employees may contribute a percentage of their annual compensation up to certain maximums, as defined by the plans and by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). Currently, we match a percentage of employee contributions in cash. At December31, 2012 and December31, 2011, the assets of the plans included approximately 10million and 9million shares of our common stock, respectively, as a result of the combination of previous employer match and participant directed contributions. We recognized expenses related to these plans of $76million, $70million and $17million and for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Deferred Compensation Plans We sponsored non-qualified unfunded deferred compensation plans for various groups that included certain of our current and former highly compensated employees. The plans have been frozen, and the participants are no longer allowed to defer compensation into the plans. The value of assets and liabilities related to these plans was not significant.
(9)Share-based Compensation We maintain equity programs that allow our Board of Directors (through its Compensation Committee or our Chief Executive Officer as its delegate) to grant incentives to certain employees and our outside directors in any one or a combination of several forms, including incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and market and performance shares. Stock options generally expire ten years from the date of grant. We also offer an ESPP, which allows eligible employees to purchase our common stock at a 15% discount based on the lower of the beginning or ending stock price during recurring six month offering periods.
Acquisitions Upon the July15, 2011, closing of our acquisition of Savvis, and pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, we assumed certain obligations under Savvis' share-based compensation arrangements. Specifically:  all Savvis stock options outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition were vested in full and were converted into 2,420,532 fully vested CenturyLink stock options, and  all non-vested Savvis restricted stock units outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition converted into an aggregate 1,080,070 non-vested CenturyLink awards.
We estimate the aggregate fair value of the assumed Savvis share-based compensation arrangements was $123million, of which $98million was attributable to services performed prior to the acquisition date and was included in the cost of the acquisition. The fair value of CenturyLink shares 131 Table of Contents was determined based on the $38.54 closing price of our common stock on July14, 2011. The remaining $25million of the aggregate fair value of the assumed Savvis awards was attributable to post-acquisition services and was recognized as compensation expense, net of forfeitures, over the remaining 1.5year vesting period.
Upon the April1, 2011, closing of our acquisition of Qwest, pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, we assumed certain obligations under Qwest's pre-existing share-based compensation arrangements. Specifically:  all Qwest non-qualified stock options outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition converted into an aggregate of 7,198,331 CenturyLink non-qualified stock options (including 5,562,198 fully vested options),  all non-vested shares of Qwest restricted stock outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition converted into an aggregate of 780,455 non-vested shares of CenturyLink restricted stock, and  all Qwest market-based awards outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition vested in full and were paid out by us through the issuance of an aggregate of 563,269 shares of CenturyLink common stock in April 2011.
The aggregate fair value of the assumed Qwest awards was $114million, of which $85million was attributable to services performed prior to the acquisition date and was included in the cost of the acquisition. The fair value of CenturyLink shares was determined based on the $41.55 closing price of our common stock on March31, 2011. We determined the fair value of Qwest's non-qualified stock options, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, reflecting a risk-free interest rate ranging from 0% to 2.13% (depending on the expected life of the option), an expected dividend yield of 6.98%, an expected term ranging from 0.1 to 4.8years (depending on the option's remaining contractual term and exercise price and on historical experience), and expected volatility ranging from 11.1% to 35.3% (based on the expected term and historical experience). The remaining $29million of the aggregate fair value of the assumed Qwest awards was attributable to the post-acquisition period and was included in the cost of the acquisition, which is being recognized as compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the remaining vesting periods from 0.1years to 3.0years.
Stock Options The following table summarizes activity involving stock option awards for the year ended December31, 2012: Number of Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price (in thousands) Outstanding at December31, 2011 10,389 $ 31.05 Exercised (3,155 ) $ 24.21 Forfeited/Expired (501 ) $ 31.31 Outstanding at December31, 2012 6,733 $ 34.23 Exercisable at December31, 2012 6,264 $ 34.70 The aggregate intrinsic value of our options outstanding and exercisable at December31, 2012 was $51million and $46million, respectively. The weighted average remaining contractual term for such options was 4.0years and 3.8years, respectively.
132 Table of Contents During 2012, we received net cash proceeds of $76million in connection with our option exercises. The tax benefit realized from these exercises was $20million. The total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $49million, $47million and $28million, respectively.
Restricted Stock For awards that contain only service conditions for vesting, we calculate its fair value based on the closing stock price on the date of grant. For restricted stock units that contain market conditions, the award fair value is calculated through Monte-Carlo simulations.
During the first quarter of 2012, we granted approximately 402,000 shares of restricted stock to certain executive-level employees as part of our long-term incentive program, of which approximately 201,000 contained only service conditions and will vest on a straight-line basis on February20, 2013, 2014 and 2015. The remaining awards contain market and service conditions and will vest on February20, 2015. These shares represent only the target for the award as each recipient has the opportunity to ultimately receive between 0% and 200% of the target restricted stock award depending on our total shareholder return for 2012, 2013 and 2014 in relation to that of the S&P500 Index.
In addition, during the first quarter of 2012, we granted restricted stock to certain key employees as part of our annual equity compensation program. These awards contained only service conditions. Approximately 519,000 of awards will vest on a straight-line basis on January9, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Approximately 873,000 of awards will vest on a straight-line basis on March15, 2013, 2014 and 2015. The remaining awards granted throughout the year to certain other key employees and our outside directors were made as part of our equity compensation and retention programs. These awards require only service conditions for vesting and typically vest over a three year period.
During the second and third quarter of 2011, we granted approximately 624,000 shares of restricted stock to certain executive-level employees as part of our long-term incentive program, of which approximately 474,000 contained only service conditions and will vest on a straight-line basis on May31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The remaining awards contain market conditions and will vest on May31, 2014. These shares represent only the target for the award as each recipient has the opportunity to ultimately receive between 0% and 200% of the target restricted stock award depending on our total shareholder return for 2011, 2012 and 2013 in relation to that of the S&P500 Index.
In addition to these awards, during 2011 we granted approximately 689,000 shares of restricted stock awards to certain other key employees and our outside directors as part of our equity compensation and retention programs. These awards require only service conditions for vesting.
During the first quarter of 2010, we granted approximately 397,000 shares of restricted stock to certain executive-level employees as part of our long-term incentive program, of which approximately 198,000 contained only service conditions and will vest on a straight-line basis on March15, 2011, 2012 and 2013. The remaining awards contain service and market conditions. One half of these awards will vest on March15, 2012 based on our two-year total shareholder return for 2010 and 2011 as measured against the total shareholder return of the companies comprising the S&P500 Index. The other half will vest on March15, 2013 based on our three-year total shareholder return for 2010, 2011 and 2012 as measured against the total shareholder return of the companies comprising the S&P500 Index. These shares represent only the target for the award as each recipient has the opportunity to ultimately receive between 0% and 200% of the target restricted stock award depending on our total shareholder return in relation to that of the S&P500 Index.
In addition to these awards, during 2010 we granted approximately 600,000 shares of restricted stock awards to certain other key employees and our outside directors as part of our equity compensation and retention programs. These awards require only service conditions for vesting.
133 Table of Contents In anticipation of our acquisition of Qwest, during the third quarter of 2010, we granted 407,000 shares of restricted stock to certain executive officers and other key employees as part of a retention program. The shares of restricted stock contain only service conditions and will vest in equal installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the April1, 2011 closing date of the acquisition. As this retention program was contingent upon the consummation of the Qwest acquisition, we did not begin expensing these awards until the closing of the acquisition on April1, 2011.
The following table summarizes activity involving restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards for the year ended December31, 2012: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value (in thousands) Non-vested at December31, 2011 4,208 $ 36.78 Granted 2,139 $ 39.13 Vested (2,603 ) $ 36.33 Forfeited (216 ) $ 39.13 Non-vested at December31, 2012 3,528 $ 38.43 During 2011, we granted 1.3million shares of restricted stock at a weighted-average price of $36.15, excluding the 1.9million shares issued in connection with our acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis. During 2010, we granted 1.4million shares of restricted stock at a weighted-average price of $36.56. The total fair value of restricted stock that vested during 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $102million, $72million and $48million, respectively.
Compensation Expense and Tax Benefit We recognize compensation expense related to our share-based awards with graded vesting that only have a service condition on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Total compensation expense for all share-based payment arrangements for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $78million, $65million and $38million, respectively. These amounts included $12million in compensation expense recognized in 2011 for the acceleration of certain awards resulting from the consummation of the Qwest acquisition. Our tax benefit recognized in the income statements for our share-based payment arrangements for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $31million, $25million and $14million, respectively. At December31, 2012, there was $92million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to our share-based payment arrangements, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.9years.
134 Table of Contents (10)Earnings Per Common Share Basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were calculated as follows: Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts, shares in thousands) Income (Numerator): Net income $ 777 573 948 Earnings applicable to non-vested restricted stock (1 ) (2 ) (6 ) Net income applicable to common stock for computing basic earnings per common share 776 571 942 Net income as adjusted for purposes of computing diluted earnings per common share $ 776 571 942 Shares (Denominator): Weighted average number of shares: Outstanding during period 622,139 534,320 301,428 Non-vested restricted stock (2,796 ) (2,209 ) (1,756 ) Non-vested restricted stock units 862 669 947 Weighted average shares outstanding for computing basic earnings per common share 620,205 532,780 300,619 Incremental common shares attributable to dilutive securities: Shares issuable under convertible securities 12 13 13 Shares issuable under incentive compensation plans 2,068 1,328 665 Number of shares as adjusted for purposes of computing diluted earnings per common share 622,285 534,121 301,297 Basic earnings per common share $ 1.25 1.07 3.13 Diluted earnings per common share $ 1.25 1.07 3.13 Our calculations of diluted earnings per common share exclude shares of common stock that are issuable upon exercise of stock options when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of our common stock during the period. Such potentially issuable shares totaled 2.2million, 2.4million and 2.9million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
(11)Fair Value Disclosure Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable and long-term debt, excluding capital lease obligations. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between independent and knowledgeable parties who are willing and able to transact for an asset or liability at the measurement date. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining 135 Table of Contents fair value and then we rank the estimated values based on the reliability of the inputs used following the fair value hierarchy set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB").
We determined the fair values of our long-term notes, including the current portion, based on quoted market prices where available or, if not available, based on discounted future cash flows using current market interest rates.
The three input levels in the hierarchy of fair value measurements are defined by the FASB generally as follows: Input Level Description of Input Level1 Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets.
Level2 Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable.
Level3 Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists.
The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our investment securities, which are reported in noncurrent other assets, and long-term debt, excluding capital lease obligations, as well as the input levels used to determine the fair values: December31, 2012 December31, 2011 Input Level Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value (Dollars in millions) AssetsInvestments securities 3 $   73 73 LiabilitiesLong-term debt excluding capital lease obligations 2 $ 19,871 21,457 21,124 22,052 In connection with the acquisition of Qwest on April1, 2011, we acquired auction rate securities that were not actively traded in liquid markets. We designated these securities as available for sale and, accordingly, we reported them on our balance sheet under our "goodwill and other assetsother" line item at fair value on December31, 2011. During 2012, we sold these securities in increments of $17million, $39million and $19million for a gain of $14million. In connection with auction rate securities sales, temporary losses of approximately $3million, net of tax, were reclassified into income from other comprehensive income and recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for 2012. During 2012, we recognized an unrealized temporary holding gain on these securities in the amount of $2million, net of tax in other comprehensive income. At December31, 2011, we estimated the fair value of these securities using a probability-weighted cash flow model that considered the coupon rate for the securities, probabilities of default and liquidation prior to maturity, and a discount rate commensurate with the creditworthiness of the issuer.
136 Table of Contents (12)Income Taxes Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Income tax expense was as follows: Federal Current $ 57 (49 ) 384 Deferred 361 401 145 State Current 15 25 67 Deferred 33 (6 ) (13 ) Foreign Current 7 4  Deferred    Total income tax expense $ 473 375 583 Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Income tax expense was allocated as follows: Income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income: Attributable to income $ 473 375 583 Stockholders' equity: Compensation expense for tax purposes in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes (18 ) (13 ) (12 ) Tax effect of the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss (434 ) (535 ) (34 ) 137 Table of Contents The following is a reconciliation from the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective income tax rate: Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 (Percentage of pre-tax income) Statutory federal income tax rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 2.5% 1.3% 1.9% Change in tax treatment of Medicare subsidy   0.3% Nondeductible acquisition related costs  0.9% 0.2% Nondeductible compensation pursuant to executive compensation limitations 0.5% 0.4% 0.2% Reversal of valuation allowance on auction rate securities (1.2)%   Foreign income taxes 0.3% 0.4%  Foreign valuation allowance  0.8%  Other, net 0.7% 0.8% 0.5% Effective income tax rate 37.8% 39.6% 38.1% Included in income tax expense for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010 is $24million and $4million, respectively, which is related to a portion of our transaction costs associated with our recent acquisitions. The transaction costs were primarily related to the acquisition of Qwest. These costs are considered non-deductible for income tax purposes. We did not incur non-deductible transaction costs in 2012.
The 2012 effective tax rate is 37.8% compared to 39.6% for 2011. The 2012 rate reflects the $16million reversal of a valuation allowance related to the auction rate securities we sold in 2012, a $12million benefit related to state NOLs net of valuation allowance, and an expense of $6million associated with reversing a receivable related to periods that have been effectively settled with the IRS. The 2011 rate increase was due in part to $24million of non-deductible transaction costs and an $8million valuation allowance recorded on deferred tax assets that require future income of a special character to realize the benefits. Because we are not currently forecasting income of an appropriate character for these benefits to be realized, we will continue to maintain a valuation allowance equal to the amount we do not believe is more likely than not to be realized. This 2011 increase was partially offset by a $16million reduction in valuation allowances related to state NOLs due primarily to the effects of a tax law change in one of the states in which we operate.
138 Table of Contents The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: Years Ended December31, 2012 2011 (Dollars in millions) Deferred tax assets Post-retirement and pension benefit costs $ 2,327 2,040 Net operating loss carryforwards 1,764 2,492 Other employee benefits 193 122 Other 754 802 Gross deferred tax assets 5,038 5,456 Less valuation allowance (281 ) (293 ) Net deferred tax assets 4,757 5,163 Deferred tax liabilities Property, plant and equipment, primarily due to depreciation differences (3,983 ) (3,638 ) Goodwill and other intangible assets (3,316 ) (4,144 ) Other (211 ) (162 ) Gross deferred tax liabilities (7,510 ) (7,944 ) Net deferred tax liability $ (2,753 ) (2,781 ) Of the $2.753billion and $2.781billion net deferred tax liability at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, $3.644billion and $3.800billion is reflected as a long-term liability and $891million and $1.019billion is reflected as a net current deferred tax asset at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011, respectively.
In connection with our acquisitions of Savvis on July15, 2011 and Qwest on April1, 2011, we recognized net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of approximately $320million and $595million, respectively, which reflects the expected future tax effects of certain differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts and tax bases of Savvis' and Qwest's assets and liabilities. In addition, due to the Qwest acquisition, we recognized a net current deferred tax asset of $271million, which relates primarily to certain accrued liabilities that are expected to result in future tax deductions. These primary differences involve Qwest's pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations as well as tax effects for acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and long-term debt, including the effects of acquisition date valuation adjustments, for both entities. The net deferred tax liability is partially offset by a deferred tax asset for expected future tax deductions relating to Savvis' and Qwest's net operating loss carryforwards.
At December31, 2012, we had federal NOLs of $4.7billion and state NOLS of $7billion. If unused, the NOLs will expire between 2015 and 2032; however, no significant amounts expire until 2020. At December31, 2012, we had $72million ($47million net of federal income tax) of state investment tax credit carryforwards that will expire between 2013 and 2024 if not utilized. In addition, at December31, 2012 we had $62million of alternative minimum tax, or AMT, credits. Our acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis caused "ownership changes" within the meaning of Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section382"). As a result, our ability to use these NOLs is subject to annual limits imposed by Section382. Despite this, we expect to use substantially all of these NOLs as an offset against our future taxable income, although the timing of that use will depend upon our future earnings and future tax circumstances.
139 Table of Contents We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to amounts we expect to realize. As of December31, 2012, a valuation allowance of $281million was established as it is more likely than not that this amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will not be utilized prior to expiration. Our valuation allowance at December31, 2012 and 2011 is primarily related to state NOL carryforwards. This valuation allowance decreased by $12million during 2012.
We recorded valuation allowances of $10million and $248million related to the Savvis and Qwest acquisitions, respectively, for the portion of the acquired net deferred tax assets that we did not believe is more likely than not to be realized. Our acquisition date assignment of deferred income taxes and the related valuation allowance was completed in 2012 as discussed in Note2Acquisitions.
A reconciliation of the change in our gross unrecognized tax benefits (excluding both interest and any related federal benefit) from January1 to December31 for 2012 and 2011 is as follows: 2012 2011 (Dollars in millions) Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 111 311 Assumed in Qwest and Savvis acquisitions  206 Increase in tax positions taken in the current year 3  Decrease due to the reversal of tax positions taken in a prior year (34 ) (13 ) Decrease from the lapse of statute of limitations (2 ) (1 ) Settlements  (392 ) Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 78 111 Upon the dismissal of our refund appeal in October 2011, we recorded a $242million settlement related to the treatment of universal service fund receipts of certain subsidiaries acquired in our Embarq acquisition, effectively settling the issue for the 1990 through 1994years. We dismissed our 2004-2006 Tax Court proceedings due to an agreement in place with the IRS Chief Counsel's office. Dismissal of the Tax Court proceedings will result in an agreed tax deficiency amount for each period. Since the Tax Court proceedings involved years that Embarq was owned by Sprint, Sprint will receive the deficiency and the payment to the IRS will trigger a settlement obligation under the Tax Sharing agreement with Sprint. During 2011, Qwest also withdrew their claims associated with the treatment of universal services fund receipts resulting in a $141million settlement decrease in our unrecognized tax benefits. Due to Qwest's NOL carryforward, the settlement of the position resulted in a reduction in our unrecognized tax benefit but no cash payment is required.
During 2012, we entered into negotiations with the IRS to resolve a claim that was filed by Qwest for 1999. Based on the status of those negotiations at year end, we have partially reversed an unrecognized tax benefit that was assumed as part of the Qwest acquisition, which decreased our total unrecognized tax benefits.
The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate was $52million at December31, 2012 and $118million at December31, 2011.
Our policy is to reflect interest expense associated with unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We had accrued interest (presented before related tax benefits) of approximately $33million at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011.
We file income tax returns, including returns for our subsidiaries, with federal, state and local jurisdictions. Our uncertain income tax positions are related to tax years that are currently under or remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities.
Beginning with the 2010 tax year, our federal consolidated returns are subject to annual examination by the IRS. Qwest's federal consolidated returns for the 2009, 2010 and pre-merger 2011 140 Table of Contents tax years are open to examination by the IRS. Federal consolidated returns for Savvis for tax years 2010 and pre-merger 2011 are under examination by the IRS.
In years prior to 2011, Qwest filed amended federal income tax returns for 2002-2007 to make protective claims with respect to items reserved in their audit settlements and to correct items not addressed in prior audits. The examination of those amended federal income tax returns by the IRS was completed in 2012. In 2012, Qwest filed an amended 2008 federal income tax return primarily to report the carryforward impact of prior year settlements. Such amended filing is subject to adjustment by the IRS. At the same time, Qwest also filed an amended return for 1999 for its predecessor U S WEST,Inc. to make certain refund claims. An agreed resolution of those claims is pending conditioned upon Congressional Joint Committee Approval.
Our open income tax years by major jurisdiction are as follows at December31, 2012: Jurisdiction Open Tax Years Federal 2008current State Florida 2006current Louisiana 2009current Minnesota 19961999 and 2002current New York 20012006 and 2009current North Carolina 20042006 and 2009current Oregon 20022003 and 2009current Texas 2008current Other states 2006current Since the period for assessing additional liability typically begins upon the filing of a return, it is possible that certain jurisdictions could assess tax for years prior to the open tax years disclosed above. Additionally, it is possible that certain jurisdictions in which we do not believe we have an income tax filing responsibility, and accordingly did not filea return, may attempt to assess a liability, or that other jurisdictions to which we pay taxes may attempt to assert that we owe additional taxes.
Based on our current assessment of various factors, including (i)the potential outcomes of these ongoing examinations, (ii)the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, (iii)the negotiated settlement of certain disputed issues, and (iv)the administrative practices of applicable taxing jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions previously taken may decrease by up to $32million within the next 12months. The actual amount of such decrease, if any, will depend on several future developments and events, many of which are outside our control.
(13)Segment Information For several years prior to 2011, we reported our operations as a single segment. However, in 2011, after our acquisitions of Qwest on April1, 2011 and Savvis on July15, 2011, we reorganized our business into the following operating segments:  Regional markets.
Consisted generally of providing strategic and legacy products and services to residential consumers, small to medium-sized businesses and regional enterprise customers. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers include our private line, broadband, Multi-Protocol Label Switching ("MPLS"), hosting and video services. Our legacy services offered to these customers include local and long-distance service;  Business markets.
Consisted generally of providing strategic and legacy products and services to enterprise and government customers. Our strategic products and services offered to these 141 Table of Contents customers include our private line, broadband, MPLS, hosting and video services. Our legacy services offered to these customers include local and long-distance service;  Wholesale markets.
Consisted generally of providing strategic and legacy products and services to other communications providers. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers are mainly private line (including special access) and MPLS. Our legacy services offered to these customers include unbundled network elements ("UNEs") which allow our wholesale customers the use of our network or a combination of our network and their own networks to provide voice and data services to their customers, long-distance and switched access services; and  Savvis operations.
Consisted of the entire centrally-managed operations of our Savvis subsidiaries, which provides hosting and network services primarily to business customers when provided by Legacy Savvis.
Effective April1, 2012, in order to more effectively leverage the strategic assets from our acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis and to better serve our business and government customers, we restructured our business into the following operating segments:  Regional markets.
Consists generally of providing strategic and legacy products and services to residential consumers, state and local governments, small to medium-sized businesses and enterprise customers that in each case are located mainly within one of our six regions. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers include our private line, broadband, MPLS, hosting, video and wireless services. Our legacy services offered to these customers include local and long-distance service;  Wholesale markets.
Consists generally of providing strategic and legacy products and services to other domestic and international communications providers. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers are mainly private line (including special access) and MPLS. Our legacy services offered to these customers include UNEs which allow our wholesale customers the use of our network or a combination of our network and their own networks to provide voice and data services to their customers, long-distance and switched access services;  Enterprise marketsnetwork.
Consists generally of providing strategic and legacy network communications products and services to national and international enterprise and government customers. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers include our private line, broadband, MPLS and hosting services. Our legacy services offered to these customers include local and long-distance services;  Enterprise marketsdata hosting.
Consists generally of providing colocation, managed hosting and cloud hosting services to national and international enterprise and government customers.
On January3, 2013, we announced a reorganization of our operating segments. Consequently, beginning with the first quarter of 2013, we will report the following four segments in our consolidated financial statements: consumer, business, wholesale and data hosting. The primary purpose of the reorganization is to strengthen our focus on the enterprise business market while continuing our commitment to our hosting and consumer customers. The reorganization combines business sales and operations functions that resided in the enterprise marketsnetwork segment and the regional markets segment into the new business segment. The remaining customers serviced by the regional markets segment will become the new consumer segment. Our wholesale markets and enterprises marketsdata hosting segments will not be impacted by this reorganization.
142 Table of Contents We have restated previously reported segment results for the year ended December31, 2011 due to the above-described restructuring of our business on April1, 2012. The following table summarizes our segment results for 2012 and 2011 based on the segment categorization we were operating under on December31, 2012.
YearsEndedDecember31, 2012 2011 (Dollarsinmillions) Total segment revenues $ 17,320 14,471 Total segment expenses 8,094 6,513 Total segment income $ 9,226 7,958 Total margin percentage 53% 55% Regional markets: Revenues $ 9,876 8,743 Expenses 4,218 3,673 Income $ 5,658 5,070 Margin percentage 57% 58% Wholesale markets: Revenues $ 3,721 3,305 Expenses 1,117 1,021 Income $ 2,604 2,284 Margin percentage 70% 69% Enterprise marketsnetwork: Revenues $ 2,609 1,933 Expenses 1,891 1,450 Income $ 718 483 Margin percentage 28% 25% Enterprise marketsdata hosting: Revenues $ 1,114 490 Expenses 868 369 Income $ 246 121 Margin percentage 22% 25% Due to system limitations, we have determined that is impracticable to restate 2010's reportable segments to conform to our current segment categorization. For comparability purposes, we have 143 Table of Contents included our segment information for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010 based on the segment categorization we were operating under on December31, 2011: YearsEndedDecember31, 2011 2010 (Dollarsinmillions) Total segment revenues $ 14,471 6,495 Total segment expenses 6,535 2,403 Total segment income $ 7,936 4,092 Total margin percentage 55% 63% Regional markets: Revenues $ 7,832 4,640 Expenses 3,398 1,783 Income $ 4,434 2,857 Margin percentage 57% 62% Business markets: Revenues $ 2,861 266 Expenses 1,736 120 Income $ 1,125 146 Margin percentage 39% 55% Wholesale markets: Revenues $ 3,295 1,589 Expenses 1,021 500 Income $ 2,274 1,089 Margin percentage 69% 69% Savvis operations: Revenues $ 483  Expenses 380  Income $ 103  Margin percentage 21%  We categorize our products and services related to revenues into the following four categories:  Strategic services , which include primarily broadband, private line (including special access which we market to wholesale and business customers), MPLS (which is a data networking technology that can deliver the quality of service required to support real-time voice and video), hosting (including cloud hosting and managed hosting), colocation, Ethernet, video (including resold satellite and our facilities-based video services), voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") and Verizon Wireless services;  Legacy services , which include primarily local, long-distance, switched access, public access, integrated services digital network ("ISDN") (which uses regular telephone lines to support voice, video and data applications), and traditional wide area network ("WAN") services (which allows a local communications network to link to networks in remote locations); 144 Table of Contents  Data integration , which includes the sale of telecommunications equipment located on customers' premises and related professional services, such as network management, installation and maintenance of data equipment and building of proprietary fiber-optic networks for our government and business customers; and  Other revenues, which consists primarily of USF revenue and surcharges. Unlike the first three revenue categories, other revenues are not included in our segment revenues.
Our operating revenues for our products and services consisted of the following categories for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011: YearsEndedDecember31, 2012 2011 (Dollarsinmillions) Strategic services $ 8,361 6,262 Legacy services 8,287 7,672 Data integration 672 537 Other 1,056 880 Total operating revenues $ 18,376 15,351 During 2012, operating revenues attributable to certain products and services were reclassified from legacy services to strategic services. Due to system limitations, we have determined that is impracticable to restate 2010's operating revenues to conform to our current revenue categorization. For comparability purposes, we have included our operating revenues for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010 under our prior revenue categorization: YearsEndedDecember31, 2011 2010 (Dollarsinmillions) Strategic services $ 6,254 2,049 Legacy services 7,680 4,288 Data integration 537 158 Other 880 547 Total operating revenues $ 15,351 7,042 Other operating revenues include revenue from universal service funds, which allows us to recover a portion of our costs under federal and state cost recovery mechanisms, and certain surcharges to our customers, including billings for our required contributions to several USF programs. These surcharge billings to our customers are reflected on a gross basis in our statements of operations (included in both operating revenues and expenses) and aggregated approximately $531million, $392million and $115million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We also generate other operating revenues from leasing and subleasing of space in our office buildings, warehouses and other properties. We centrally-manage the activities that generate these other operating revenues and consequently these revenues are not included in any of our four segments presented above.
Our segment revenues include all revenues from our strategic, legacy and data integration as described in more detail above. Segment revenues are based upon each customer's classification to an 145 Table of Contents individual segment. We report our segment revenues based upon all services provided to that segment's customers. We report our segment expenses for our four segments as follows:  Direct expenses , which primarily are specific expenses incurred as a direct result of providing services and products to segment customers, along with selling, general and administrative expenses that are directly associated with specific segment customers or activities; and  Allocated expenses , which include network expenses, facilities expenses and other expenses such as fleet and real estate expenses.
During the first quarter of 2012, as we transitioned certain of Qwest's legacy systems to our historical company systems, we updated our methodologies for reporting our direct expenses and for allocating our expenses to our segments. Specifically, we no longer include certain fleet expenses for our regional markets segment in direct expenses; they are now expenses allocated to our segments, with the exception of enterprise marketsdata hosting. In addition, we now more fully allocate network building rent and power expenses to our regional markets, wholesale markets and enterprise marketsnetwork segments. We determined that it was impracticable to recast our segment results for the prior period to reflect these changes in methodology.
During the second quarter of 2012, as we reorganized our business into our four segments as indicated above, we further revised our methodology for how we allocate our expenses to our segments to better align segment expenses with related revenues. Under our revised methodology, we no longer allocate certain product development costs to our segments, but we do now allocate certain expenses from our enterprise marketsdata hosting segment to our other three segments. We have restated prior periods to reflect these changes in our methodology.
We do not assign depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, as the related assets and capital expenditures are centrally managed. Similarly, severance expenses, restructuring expenses and, subject to an exception for our enterprise marketsdata hosting segment, certain centrally managed administrative functions (such as finance, information technology, legal and human resources) are not assigned to our segments. Interest expense is also excluded from segment results because we manage our financing on a total company basis and have not allocated assets or debt to specific segments. In addition, other income (expense) does not relate to our segment operations and is therefore excluded from our segment results.
The following table reconciles segment income to net income for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: YearsEndedDecember31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollarsinmillions) Total segment income $ 9,226 7,958 4,092 Other operating revenues 1,056 880 547 Depreciation and amortization (4,780 ) (4,026 ) (1,434 ) Other unassigned operating expenses (2,789 ) (2,787 ) (1,145 ) Other income (expense), net (1,463 ) (1,077 ) (529 ) Income tax expense (473 ) (375 ) (583 ) Net income $ 777 573 948 We do not have any single customer that provides more than 10% of our total operating revenues. Substantially all of our revenues come from customers located in the United States.

See Note2Acquisitions for additional information. During the third quarter of 2012, we discovered and corrected an error that resulted in an overstatement of depreciation expense in the amount of $30million in 2011 and $15million in the first six months of 2012. The total reduction in depreciation expense of $45million was recognized in the third quarter of 2012.
(15)Commitments and Contingencies In this section, when we refer to a class action as "putative" it is because a class has been alleged, but not certified in that matter. Until and unless a class has been certified by the court, it has not been established that the named plaintiffs represent the class of plaintiffs they purport to represent.
We have established accrued liabilities for the matters described below where losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable.
We are vigorously defending against all of the matters described below. As a matter of course, we are prepared both to litigate the matters to judgment, as well as to evaluate and consider all settlement opportunities.
Litigation Matters Relating to CenturyLink and Embarq In December 2009, subsidiaries of CenturyLink filed two lawsuits against subsidiaries of Sprint Nextel to recover terminating access charges for VoIP traffic owed under various interconnection agreements and tariffs which presently approximate $34million. The lawsuits allege that Sprint Nextel has breached contracts, violated tariffs, and violated the Federal Communications Act by failing to pay these charges. One lawsuit, filed on behalf of all legacy Embarq operating entities, was tried in federal court in Virginia in August 2010 and, in March 2011, a ruling was issued in our favor and against Sprint Nextel. In the first quarter of 2012, Sprint Nextel filed an appeal of this decision. The other lawsuit, filed on behalf of all Legacy CenturyLink operating entities, is pending in federal court in 147 Table of Contents Louisiana. In that case, in early 2011 the Court dismissed certain of CenturyLink's claims, referred other claims to the FCC, and stayed the litigation. In April 2012, Sprint Nextel filed a petition with the FCC, seeking a declaratory ruling that CenturyLink's access charges do not apply to VoIP originated calls. We have not deferred revenue related to these matters as an adverse outcome is not probable based upon current circumstances.
In William Douglas Fulghum, et al. v. Embarq Corporation, et al.
, filed on December28, 2007 in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, a group of retirees filed a putative class action lawsuit challenging the decision to make certain modifications in retiree benefits programs relating to life insurance, medical insurance and prescription drug benefits, generally effective January1, 2006 and January1, 2008 (which, at the time of the modifications, was expected to reduce estimated future expenses for the subject benefits by more than $300million). Defendants include Embarq, certain of its benefit plans, its Employee Benefits Committee and the individual plan administrator of certain of its benefits plans. Additional defendants include Sprint Nextel and certain of its benefit plans. The Court certified a class on certain of plaintiffs' claims, but rejected class certification as to other claims. Embarq and other defendants continue to vigorously contest these claims and charges. On October14, 2011, the Fulghum lawyers filed a new, related lawsuit, Abbott et al. v. Sprint Nextel et al.
CenturyLink/Embarq is not named a defendant in the lawsuit. In Abbott, approximately 1,500 plaintiffs allege breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the changes in retiree benefits that also are at issue in the Fulghum case. The Abbott plaintiffs are all members of the class that was certified in Fulghum on claims for allegedly vested benefits (Counts I and III), and the Abbott claims are similar to the Fulghum breach of fiduciary duty claim (Count II), on which the Fulghum court denied class certification. The Court has stayed proceedings in Abbott indefinitely. On February14, 2013, the Fulghum court dismissed the majority of the plaintiffs' claims in that case. Embarq and the other defendants will continue to vigorously contest any remaining claims in Fulghum and seek to have the claims in the Abbott case dismissed on similar grounds. We have not accrued a liability for these matters as it is premature (i)to determine whether an accrual is warranted and, (ii)if so, a reasonable estimate of probable liability.
Litigation Matters Relating to Qwest The terms and conditions of applicable bylaws, certificates or articles of incorporation, agreements or applicable law may obligate Qwest to indemnify its former directors, officers or employees with respect to certain of the matters described below, and Qwest has been advancing legal fees and costs to certain former directors, officers or employees in connection with certain matters described below.
On September29, 2010, the trustees in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding for KPNQwest,N.V. (of which Qwest was a major shareholder) filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Haarlem, the Netherlands, alleging tort and mismanagement claims under Dutch law. Qwest and Koninklijke KPNN.V. ("KPN") are defendants in this lawsuit along with a number of former KPNQwest supervisory board members and a former officer of KPNQwest, some of whom were formerly affiliated with Qwest. Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that defendants' actions were a cause of the bankruptcy of KPNQwest, and they seek damages for the bankruptcy deficit of KPNQwest, which is claimed to be approximately 4.200billion (or approximately $5.6billion based on the exchange rate on December31, 2012), plus statutory interest. Two lawsuits asserting similar claims were previously filed against Qwest and others in federal courts in New Jersey in 2004 and Colorado in 2009; those courts dismissed the lawsuits without prejudice on the grounds that the claims should not be litigated in the United States.
On September13, 2006, Cargill Financial Markets,Plc and Citibank, N.A. filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, against Qwest, KPN, KPN TelecomB.V., and other former officers, employees or supervisory board members of KPNQwest, some of whom were formerly affiliated with Qwest. The lawsuit alleges that defendants misrepresented KPNQwest's financial and business condition in connection with the origination of a credit facility and wrongfully allowed 148 Table of Contents KPNQwest to borrow funds under that facility. Plaintiffs allege damages of approximately 219million (or approximately $289million based on the exchange rate on December31, 2012). On April25, 2012, the court issued its judgment denying the claims asserted by Cargill and Citibank in their lawsuit. Cargill and Citibank are appealing that decision.
We have not accrued a liability for the above matters. Regarding the 2010 proceeding, we believe it is premature to determine whether an accrual is warranted and, if so, a reasonable estimate of our probable liability. Regarding the 2006 suit, we do not believe that liability is probable. We will continue to defend against both KPNQwest litigation matters vigorously.
Several putative class actions relating to the installation of fiber optic cable in certain rights-of-way were filed against Qwest on behalf of landowners on various dates and in courts located in 34 states in which Qwest has such cable (Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.) For the most part, the complaints challenge our right to install our fiber optic cable in railroad rights-of-way. The complaints allege that the railroads own the right-of-way as an easement that did not include the right to permit us to install our cable in the right-of-way without the Plaintiffs' consent. Most of the currently pending actions purport to be brought on behalf of state-wide classes in the named Plaintiffs' respective states, although one action pending before the Illinois Court of Appeals purports to be brought on behalf of landowners in Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin. In general, the complaints seek damages on theories of trespass and unjust enrichment, as well as punitive damages. After previous attempts to enter into a single nationwide settlement in a single court proved unsuccessful, the parties proceeded to seek court approval of settlements on a state-by-state basis. To date, the parties have received final approval of such settlements in 22 states (Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin), have received preliminary approval of the settlements in eight states (California, Kentucky, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Utah), and have not yet received either preliminary or final approval in four states (Arizona, Massachusetts, New Mexico and Texas). We have accrued an amount that we believe is probable for these matters; however, the amount is not material to our consolidated financial statements.
Other Matters From time to time, we are involved in other proceedings incidental to our business, including patent infringement allegations, administrative hearings of state public utility commissions relating primarily to rate making, actions relating to employee claims, various tax issues, environmental law issues, grievance hearings before labor regulatory agencies, and miscellaneous third party tort actions. The outcome of these other proceedings is not predictable. However, based on current circumstances we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these other proceedings, after considering available defenses and insurance coverage, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Capital Leases We lease certain facilities and equipment under various capital lease arrangements. Depreciation of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense. Payments on capital leases are included in repayments of long-term debt, including current maturities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
149 Table of Contents The tables below summarize our capital lease activity: YearsEndedDecember31, 2012 2011 (Dollarsinmillions) Assets acquired through capital leases $ 209 696 Depreciation expense 150 89 Cash payments towards capital leases 113 76 December31, 2012 December31, 2011 (Dollarsinmillions) Assets included in property, plant and equipment $ 893 698 Accumulated depreciation 229 91 The future annual minimum payments under capital lease arrangements as of December31, 2012 were as follows: Future Minimum Payments (Dollarsin millions) Capital lease obligations: 2013 $ 155 2014 143 2015 107 2016 72 2017 68 2018 and thereafter 381 Total minimum payments 926 Less: amount representing interest and executory costs (245 ) Present value of minimum payments 681 Less: current portion (117 ) Long-term portion $ 564 Operating Leases CenturyLink leases various equipment, office facilities, retail outlets, switching facilities, and other network sites. These leases, with few exceptions, provide for renewal options and escalations that are either fixed or based on the consumer price index. Any rent abatements, along with rent escalations, are included in the computation of rent expense calculated on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease term for most leases includes the initial non-cancelable term plus any term under renewal options that are reasonably assured. For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, our gross rental expense was $445million, $401million and $174million, respectively. We also received sublease rental income for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011 of $18million and $17million, respectively. We did not have any material sublease rental income for the year ended December31, 2010.
150 Table of Contents At December31, 2012, our future rental commitments for operating leases were as follows: Future Minimum Payments (Dollarsin millions) 2013 $ 297 2014 252 2015 219 2016 183 2017 156 2018 and thereafter 964 Total future minimum payments (1) $ 2,071 (1) Minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $115million due in the future under non-cancelable subleases.
Purchase Obligations We have several commitments primarily for marketing activities and support services from a variety of vendors to be used in the ordinary course of business totaling $524million at December31, 2012. Of this amount, we expect to purchase $213million in 2013, $129million in 2014 through 2015, $86million in 2016 through 2017 and $96million in 2018 and thereafter. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed.
(16)Other Financial Information Other Current Assets The following table presents details of our other current assets: December31, 2012 2011 (Dollarsinmillions) Prepaid expenses $ 257 240 Materials, supplies and inventory 125 107 Assets held for sale 96  Deferred activation and installation charges 53 25 Other 21 21 Total other current assets $ 552 393 During the second quarter of 2012, we reclassified $154million related to our wireless spectrum assets from "Other intangible assets, net" to "current assetsother" in the consolidated balance sheet. We sold $58million of our wireless spectrum assets during the fourth quarter of 2012, and we sold another $43million of our wireless spectrum assets in January 2013. In the aggregate, these transactions resulted in a gain of $32million. We expect to reach agreements with various other purchasers for the remaining spectrum, and the consummation of which will be subject to regulatory approval.
151 Table of Contents Selected Current Liabilities Current liabilities reflected in our balance sheets include accounts payable and other current liabilities as follows: December31 2012 2011 (Dollarsinmillions) Accounts payable $ 1,207 1,400 Other current liabilities: Accrued rent $ 48 44 Legal reserves 39 44 Other 147 167 Total other current liabilities $ 234 255 Included in accounts payable at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011 were $132million and $61million, respectively, representing book overdrafts.
(17)Labor Union Contracts Over 38% of our employees are members of various bargaining units represented by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Approximately 12,000, or 26%, of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements that expired October6, 2012. We are currently negotiating the terms of new agreements. In the meantime, the predecessor agreements have been extended, and the applicable unions have agreed to provide us with at least twenty-four hour advance notice before terminating those predecessor agreements. Any strikes or other changes in our labor relations could have a significant impact on our business. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, our business and operating results could be materially harmed. To help mitigate this potential risk, we have established contingency plans in which we would assign trained, non-represented employees to cover jobs for represented employees in the event of a work stoppage to provide continuity for our customers.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The effectiveness of our or any system of disclosure controls and procedures is subject to certain limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing and evaluating the controls and procedures, the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of future events and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. As a result, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect all errors or fraud. By their nature, our or any system of disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives.
Our Chief Executive Officer, GlenF. Post,III, and our Chief Financial Officer, R.Stewart Ewing,Jr., have evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the "Exchange Act") at December31, 2012. Based on the evaluation, Messrs.Post and Ewing concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed, and are effective, to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including Messrs.Post and Ewing, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during 2012 that materially affected, or that we believe are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
See Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on our internal control over financial reporting in Item8, which are incorporated herein by reference.
