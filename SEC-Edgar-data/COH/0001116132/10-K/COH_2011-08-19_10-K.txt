PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS Founded in 1941, Coach was acquired by Sara Lee Corporation (Sara Lee) in 1985. In June 2000, Coach was incorporated in the state of Maryland. In October 2000, Coach was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and sold approximately 68 million shares of common stock, split adjusted, representing 19.5% of the outstanding shares. In April 2001, Sara Lee completed a distribution of its remaining ownership in Coach via an exchange offer, which allowed Sara Lee stockholders to tender Sara Lee common stock for Coach common stock.
In June 2001, Coach Japan was formed to expand our presence in the Japanese market and to exercise greater control over our brand in that country. Coach Japan was initially formed as a joint venture with Sumitomo Corporation. On July 1, 2005, we purchased Sumitomos 50% interest in Coach Japan, resulting in Coach Japan becoming a 100% owned subsidiary of Coach, Inc.
In fiscal 2009, the Company acquired the Coach domestic retail businesses in Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China (Coach China) from its former distributor, the ImagineX group. These acquisitions provide the Company with greater control over the brand in China, enabling Coach to raise brand awareness and aggressively grow market share with the Chinese consumer.
In fiscal 2011, the Company entered into an agreement to assume direct control of its domestic retail businesses in Malaysia and Singapore which were operated by Valiram Group, with a phased transition of such businesses, beginning with Singapore in July 2011.
Additionally in fiscal 2011, the Company acquired a non-controlling interest in a joint venture with Hackett Limited to expand the Coach International business in Europe. Through the joint venture, the Company opened retail locations in Spain, Portugal and Great Britain beginning in fiscal 2011, and currently anticipates further European expansion in fiscal 2012.

1 TABLE OF CONTENTS A Loyal And Involved Consumer Coach consumers have a specific emotional connection with the brand. Part of the Companys everyday mission is to cultivate consumer relationships by strengthening this emotional connection.
A Multi-Channel International Distribution Model This allows Coach to maintain a critical balance as results do not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area. The Direct-to-Consumer channel provides us with immediate, controlled access to consumers through Coach-operated stores in North America, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China and the Internet. The Indirect channel provides us with access to consumers via wholesale department store and specialty store locations in over 20 countries.

Fragrance is distributed through Coach retail stores, coach.com and about 3,000 U.S. department stores. Coach offers four womens fragrance collections and one mens fragrance. The womens fragrance collections include eau de perfume spray, eau de toilette spray, purse spray, body lotion and body splashes.
DESIGN AND MERCHANDISING Coachs New York-based design team, led by its Executive Creative Director, is responsible for conceptualizing and directing the design of all Coach products. Designers have access to Coachs extensive archives of product designs created over the past 70 years, which are a valuable resource for new product concepts. Coach designers are also supported by a strong merchandising team that analyzes sales, market trends and consumer preferences to identify business opportunities that help guide each seasons design process. Merchandisers also analyze products and edit, add and delete to achieve profitable sales across all channels. The product category teams, each comprised of design, merchandising/product development and sourcing specialists help Coach execute design concepts that are consistent with the brands strategic direction.
Coachs design and merchandising teams work in close collaboration with all of our licensing partners to ensure that the licensed products (watches, footwear, eyewear and fragrance) are conceptualized and designed to address the intended market opportunity and convey the distinctive perspective and lifestyle associated with the Coach brand.
During fiscal 2008, the Company announced a new business initiative to drive brand creativity. This initiative has evolved into the Reed Krakoff brand, representing New American luxury which is supported by a team of experienced designers and merchandisers and encompasses all womens categories, with a focus on ready-to-wear, handbags, accessories, footwear and jewelry. We introduced the Reed Krakoff brand with store openings in North America and Japan, and Europe through specialty retailers in early fiscal 2011.
SEGMENTS Coach operates in two reportable segments: Direct-to-Consumer and Indirect. The reportable segments represent channels of distribution that offer similar products, service and marketing strategies.
Direct-to-Consumer Segment The Direct-to-Consumer segment consists of channels that provide us with immediate, controlled access to consumers: Coach-operated stores in North America, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China, the Internet and the Coach catalog. This segment represented approximately 87% of Coachs total net sales in fiscal 2011, with North American stores and the Internet, Coach Japan and Coach China contributing approximately 64%, 18% and 5% of total net sales, respectively.
North American Retail Stores Coach stores are located in regional shopping centers and metropolitan areas throughout the U.S. and Canada. The retail stores carry an assortment of products depending on their size and location. Our flagship stores, which offer the broadest assortment of Coach products, are located in high-visibility locations such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Toronto.
3 TABLE OF CONTENTS Our stores are sophisticated, sleek, modern and inviting. They showcase the world of Coach and enhance the shopping experience while reinforcing the image of the Coach brand. The modern store design creates a distinctive environment to display our products. Store associates are trained to maintain high standards of visual presentation, merchandising and customer service. The result is a complete statement of the Coach modern American style at the retail level.

These stores operate under the Coach Factory name and are geographically positioned primarily in established outlet centers that are generally more than 40 miles from major markets.
Coachs factory store design, visual presentations and customer service levels support and reinforce the brands image. Through these factory stores, Coach targets value-oriented customers who would not otherwise buy the Coach brand. Prices are generally discounted from 10% to 50% below full retail prices.

Flagship stores, which offer the broadest assortment of Reed Krakoff products, are located in select shopping districts in the U.S. and Japan.
Indirect Segment Coach began as a U.S. wholesaler to department stores and this segment remains important to our overall consumer reach. Today, we work closely with our partners, both domestic and international, to ensure a clear and consistent product presentation. The Indirect segment represented approximately 13% of total net sales in fiscal 2011, with U.S. Wholesale and Coach International representing approximately 7% and 5% of total net sales, respectively. The Indirect segment also includes royalties earned on licensed product.
U.S. Wholesale This channel offers access to Coach products to consumers who prefer shopping at department stores. Coach products are also available on macys.com, dillards.com and nordstrom.com. While overall U.S. department store sales have not increased over the last few years, the handbag and accessories category has remained strong, in large part due to the strength of the Coach brand. The Company continues to manage inventories in this channel given the highly promotional environment at point-of-sale.
Coach recognizes the continued importance of U.S. department stores as a distribution channel for premier accessories. We continue to fine-tune our strategy to increase productivity and drive volume in existing locations by enhancing presentation, primarily through the creation of more shop-in-shops with proprietary Coach fixtures. Coach custom tailors its assortments through wholesale product planning and allocation processes to better match the attributes of our department store consumers in each local market.
5 TABLE OF CONTENTS Coachs products are sold in approximately 970 wholesale locations in the U.S. and Canada. Our most significant U.S. wholesale customers are Macys (including Bloomingdales), Dillards, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Carsons and Saks Fifth Avenue.
Coach International This channel represents sales to international wholesale distributors and authorized retailers. Travel retail represents the largest portion of our customers sales in this channel. However, we continue to drive growth by expanding our distribution to reach local consumers in emerging markets. Coach has developed relationships with a select group of distributors who sell Coach products through department stores and freestanding retail locations in over 20 countries. Coachs current network of international distributors serves the following markets: South Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, US & Territories, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Thailand, UAE, Hong Kong, Spain, China, Indonesia, Bahamas, Bahrain, India, Macau, New Zealand, Portugal, United Kingdom and Vietnam.
For locations not in freestanding stores, Coach has created shop-in-shops and other image enhancing environments to increase brand appeal and stimulate growth. Coach continues to improve productivity in this channel by opening larger image-enhancing locations, expanding existing stores and closing smaller, less productive stores. Coachs most significant international wholesale customers are the DFS Group, Shinsegae International, Tasa Meng Corp, Lotte Group and Shilla Group.
In mid-July 2010, Coach entered into an agreement with a key distributor to take control of our domestic retail businesses in Singapore and Malaysia. Coach will begin directly operating these markets in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013, respectively.
Subsequent to July 2, 2011, Coach entered into distribution agreements for Brazil and Vietnam, with first openings in these countries anticipated in fiscal 2012.
The following table shows the number of international wholesale locations at which Coach products are sold: Fiscal Year Ended July 2, 2011 July 3, 2010 June 27, 2009 International freestanding stores 61 53 44 International department store locations 109 93 81 Other international locations 41 36 34 Total international wholesale locations 211 182 159 Licensing In our licensing relationships, Coach takes an active role in the design process and controls the marketing and distribution of products under the Coach brand. The current licensing relationships as of July 2, 2011 are as follows: Category Licensing Partner Introduction Date Territory License Expiration Date Watches Movado Spring '98 Worldwide 2015 Footwear Jimlar Spring '99 U.S.
2014 Eyewear Marchon Fall '03 Worldwide 2011 Eyewear Luxottica Spring '12 Worldwide 2016 Fragrance Estee Lauder Spring '10 Worldwide 2015 Products made under license are, in most cases, sold through all of the channels discussed above and, with Coachs approval, these licensees have the right to distribute Coach brand products selectively through several other channels: shoes in department store shoe salons, watches in selected jewelry stores and eyewear in selected optical retailers. These venues provide additional, yet controlled, exposure of the Coach brand. Coachs licensing partners pay royalties to Coach on their net sales of Coach branded products. However, such royalties are not material to the Coach business as they currently comprise less than 1% of Coachs total net sales. The licensing agreements generally give Coach the right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are not achieved.
6 TABLE OF CONTENTS MARKETING Coachs marketing strategy is to deliver a consistent message each time the consumer comes in contact with the Coach brand through our communications and visual merchandising. The Coach image is created internally and executed by the creative marketing, visual merchandising and public relations teams. Coach also has a sophisticated consumer and market research capability, which helps us assess consumer attitudes and trends and gauge the likelihood of a products success in the marketplace prior to its introduction.
In conjunction with promoting a consistent global image, Coach uses its extensive customer database and consumer knowledge to target specific products and communications to specific consumers to efficiently stimulate sales across all distribution channels.
Coach engages in several consumer communication initiatives, including direct marketing activities and national, regional and local advertising. In fiscal 2011, consumer contacts increased 52% to over 625 million primarily driven by increased email communications. The Company continues to leverage marketing expenses by refining our marketing programs to increase productivity and optimize distribution. Total expenses related to consumer communications in fiscal 2011 were $75.0 million, representing less than 2% of net sales.
Coachs wide range of direct marketing activities includes email contacts, catalogs and brochures targeted to promote sales to consumers in their preferred shopping venue. In addition to building brand awareness, the coach.com and reedkrakoff.com websites and the Coach catalog serve as effective brand communications vehicles by providing a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a strategic offering of the latest styles and colors, which drive store traffic.
As part of Coachs direct marketing strategy, the Company uses its database consisting of approximately 19 million active households in North America and 4.2 million active households in Japan. Email contacts and catalogs are Coachs principal means of communication and are sent to selected households to stimulate consumer purchases and build brand awareness. During fiscal 2011, the Company sent approximately 480 million emails to strategically selected customers as we continue to evolve our internet outreach to maximize productivity while streamlining distribution. In fiscal 2011, the Company distributed approximately a million catalogs in Coach stores in Japan, Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China. The growing number of visitors to the coach.com websites in the U.S., Canada and Japan provides an opportunity to increase the size of these databases.
In fiscal 2011, Coach had informational websites in Australia, Bahrain, China, France, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, UAE and United Kingdom. In addition, the Company utilizes and continues to explore new technologies such as blogs and social networking websites, including Twitter and Facebook, as a cost effective consumer communication opportunity to increase on-line and store sales and build brand awareness.
The Company also runs national, regional and local advertising campaigns in support of its major selling seasons.
MANUFACTURING While all of our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers, we nevertheless maintain control of the supply chain process from design through manufacture. We are able to do this by qualifying raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing and product development offices in Hong Kong, China, South Korea, India, Italy and Vietnam that work closely with our independent manufacturers. This broad-based, global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost, lead times and construction capabilities. Over the last several years, we have increased the presence of our senior management at our manufacturers facilities to enhance control over decision making and ensure the speed with which we bring new product to market is maximized.
These independent manufacturers support a broad mix of product types, materials and a seasonal influx of new, fashion oriented styles, which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. During fiscal 2011, approximately 84% of Coachs total net sales were generated from 7 TABLE OF CONTENTS products introduced within the fiscal year. As the collections are seasonal and planned to be sold in stores for short durations, our production quantities are limited which lowers our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory.
All product sources, including independent manufacturers and licensing partners, must achieve and maintain Coachs high quality standards, which are an integral part of the Coach identity. One of Coachs keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials. Coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware. Although Coach products are manufactured by independent manufacturers, we maintain control of the raw materials that are used in all of our products. Compliance with quality control standards is monitored through on-site quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities.
Coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of better brand partners with demonstrated integrity, quality and reliable delivery. Our manufacturers are located in many countries, including China, United States, Italy, Hong Kong, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Macau, Philippines, Turkey, Colombia, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and Taiwan. Coach continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the lowest cost and help limit the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets. No one vendor currently provides more than approximately 15% of Coachs total units. Before partnering with a vendor, Coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit. Periodic evaluations of existing, previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis. We believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with Coachs integrity standards.
DISTRIBUTION Coach operates an 850,000 square foot distribution and consumer service facility in Jacksonville, Florida. This automated facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system. Coachs distribution center employees use handheld radio frequency scanners to read product bar codes, which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders, track shipments, manage inventory and generally provide excellent service to our customers. Coachs products are primarily shipped to Coach retail stores and wholesale customers via express delivery providers and common carriers, and direct to consumers via express delivery providers.
To support our growth in China and the region, during the second half of fiscal 2010 we established an Asia distribution center in Shanghai, owned and operated by a third-party, allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region while reducing costs. The Company also operates a distribution center, through a third-party, in Japan.
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS The foundation of Coachs information systems is its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. This fully integrated system supports all aspects of finance and accounting, procurement, inventory control, sales and store replenishment. The system functions as a central repository for all of Coachs transactional information, resulting in increased efficiencies, improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand. This system was upgraded in fiscal 2008 and continues to be fully scalable to accommodate growth.
Complementing its ERP system are several other system solutions, each of which Coach believes is well suited for its needs. The data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single platform for all management reporting. The supply chain management system supports sales and inventory planning and reporting functions. Product fulfillment is facilitated by Coachs highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system, while the unique requirements of Coachs internet and catalog businesses are supported by Coachs order management system. Finally, the point-of-sale system supports all in-store transactions, distributes management reporting to each store, and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis. This daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment. Updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality. All complementary systems are integrated with the central ERP system.
8 TABLE OF CONTENTS TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS Coach owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing and distribution of all of its products, both in the U.S. and in other countries in which the products are principally sold. Coach also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which Coach products are sold. Major trademarks include Coach, Coach and lozenge design, Coach and tag design, Signature C design, Coach Op Art design and The Heritage Logo (Coach Leatherware Est. 1941) . Coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although Coach believes that the Coach name is important for its business. In addition, several of Coachs products are covered by design patents or patent applications. Coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress, and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally. It also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally, as well as through its network of investigators, the Coach hotline and business partners around the world.
Coach expects that its material trademarks will remain in existence for as long as Coach continues to use and renew them. Coach has no material patents.
SEASONALITY Because Coach products are frequently given as gifts, Coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. Over the last several years, we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non-holiday quarters, which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION Most of Coachs imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that Coach may import into the U.S. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. Coach has not been restricted by quotas in the operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of its products. In addition, Coach is subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including retaliation against certain prohibited foreign practices, with respect to its product sourcing and international sales operations.
COMPETITION The premium handbag and accessories industry is highly competitive. The Company mainly competes with European luxury brands as well as private label retailers, including some of Coachs wholesale customers. Over the last several years the category has grown, encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors. The Company believes, however, that as a market leader we benefit from this increased competition as it drives consumer interest in this brand loyal category.
The Company further believes that there are several factors that differentiate us from our competitors, including but not limited to: distinctive newness, innovation and quality of our products, ability to meet consumers changing preferences and our superior customer service.
EMPLOYEES As of July 2, 2011, Coach employed approximately 15,000 people, including both full and part time employees. Of these employees, approximately 5,200 and 6,800 were full time and part time employees, respectively, in the retail field in North America, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China. Approximately 65 of Coachs employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Coach believes that its relations with its employees are good, and it has never encountered a strike or work stoppage.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the Business of Coach and forward-looking information in this document. Please also see Special Note on Forward-Looking Information at the beginning of this report. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer.
The current economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items.
The current uncertain global economic conditions are having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world. Our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, fuel and energy costs, global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers.
Demand for our products, and consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market generally, is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence, general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, and taxation. Consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as Coach products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. The general economic conditions in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our products for the foreseeable future and adversely impact our results of operations.
The growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to expand internationally.
Our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. Our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. The failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. Also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position.
Additionally, our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions, including Asia and Europe. We currently plan to open additional Coach stores in China, and we have entered into strategic agreements with various partners to expand our operations in Europe and to take control of certain of our retail operations in the Asia-Pacific region. We do not yet have significant experience operating in these countries, and in many of them we face established competitors. Many of these countries have different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, and local reporting or legal requirements.
10 TABLE OF CONTENTS Furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. In many of these countries, there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.
Significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.
We face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. Our competitors are European and American luxury brands as well as private label retailers, including some of Coachs wholesale customers. There is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers. We may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability.
We face risks associated with operating in international markets.
We operate on a global basis, with approximately 30% of our net sales coming from operations outside the U.S. However, sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in U.S. dollars. While geographic diversity helps to reduce the Companys exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to:  changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates,  political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets,  natural and other disasters in international and other markets such as the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and  changes in foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other government controls.
We monitor our foreign currency exposure in Japan and Canada and in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we hedge our subsidiaries U.S. dollar-denominated inventory purchases, as well as Coach Japans U.S. dollar-denominated intercompany loan. We cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will succeed in offsetting any impact of foreign currency rate movements.
Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure the brand and negatively affect sales.
We believe our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. We devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts worldwide. In spite of our efforts, counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third-partys rights related to trademark, copyright, or patent this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operation. We are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal or other appropriate action. We cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associates with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses. Finally, many countries laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as US laws.
11 TABLE OF CONTENTS Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities.
As a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to:  unavailability of or significant fluctuations in the cost of raw materials,  compliance with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations,  imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports,  increases in the cost of labor, fuel, travel and transportation,  compliance with our Global Business Integrity Program,  disruptions or delays in shipments,  loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites,  inability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the Companys cost-effective sourcing model,  product quality issues,  political unrest, and  natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control.
While we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our Global Operating Principles and/or Supplier Selection Guidelines, we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor or other business practices. Copies of our Global Business Integrity Program, Global Operating Principles and Supplier Selection Guidelines are posted on our website, coach.com. The violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturers or suppliers labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the U.S., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
While we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing sites, significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our business.
Increases in our costs, such as raw materials, labor or freight could negatively impact our overall profitability. Labor costs at many of our manufacturers has been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. The cost of transportation has been increasing as well and it is unlikely such cost pressure will abate if oil prices continue to increase. We may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials or labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means. These increasing costs of productions could also adversely affect our ability to achieve the gross margin objectives we have established.
Our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products.
If Coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. In addition, because Coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers orders, it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated. If that occurs, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our business.
12 TABLE OF CONTENTS Our Indirect segment could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry.
Our Indirect segment, consisting of the U.S. Wholesale and Coach International businesses comprised approximately 13% of total net sales for fiscal 2011. Continued consolidation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, stores that carry our and our licensees products. Furthermore, a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within our Indirect segment.
Our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of Coach common stock.
Because Coach products are frequently given as gifts, Coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December. Poor sales in Coachs second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.
If we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.
Our quarterly cash dividend is currently $0.225 per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a modest portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors (Board) may, at its discretion, decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price.
Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price.
We are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which includes reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. In addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. Further, there is proposed tax legislation that may be enacted in the future, which could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates.
Provisions in Coachs charter, bylaws and Maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of Coach by a third party.
Coachs charter, bylaws and Maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Coach without the consent of Coachs Board. Coachs charter permits its Board, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that Coach has the authority to issue. In addition, Coachs Board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Although Coachs Board has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for Coachs common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of Coachs stockholders.
13 TABLE OF CONTENTS Coachs bylaws can only be amended by Coachs Board. Coachs bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to Coachs Board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by Coachs Board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of Coachs bylaws. Also, under Maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of equity securities, between Coach and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of Coachs common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a five-year period, beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10% stockholder, unless exempted in accordance with the statute. After this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by Coachs Board.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The following table sets forth the location, use and size of Coachs distribution, corporate and product development facilities as of July 2, 2011. The majority of the properties are leased, with the leases expiring at various times through 2028, subject to renewal options.
Location Use Approximate Square Footage Jacksonville, Florida Distribution and consumer service 850,000 New York, New York Corporate, sourcing and product development 433,000 (1) Carlstadt, New Jersey Corporate and product development 65,000 Tokyo, Japan Coach Japan regional management 32,000 Dongguan, China Sourcing, quality control and product development 27,000 Shanghai, China Coach China regional management 22,000 Hong Kong Sourcing and quality control 17,000 Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam Sourcing and quality control 11,000 Hong Kong Coach Hong Kong regional management 9,000 Hong Kong Sourcing and quality control 6,000 Beijing, China Coach China regional management 3,000 Seoul, South Korea Sourcing 3,000 Long An, Vietnam Sourcing and quality control 1,000 Chennai, India Sourcing and quality control 600 Luxembourg Coach regional management 300 (1) Includes 250,000 square feet in Coach owned buildings. During fiscal 2009, Coach purchased its corporate headquarters building at 516 West 34th Street in New York City for $126.3 million.
As of July 2, 2011, Coach also occupied 345 retail and 143 factory leased stores located in North America, 169 Coach-operated department store shop-in-shops, retail stores and factory stores in Japan and 66 Coach-operated department store shop-in-shops, retail stores and factory stores in Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China. These leases expire at various times through 2024. Coach considers these properties to be in generally good condition and believes that its facilities are adequate for its operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet its anticipated requirements.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Coach is involved in various routine legal proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant incident to the ordinary course of its business, including proceedings to protect Coachs intellectual property rights, litigation instituted by persons alleged to have been injured upon premises within Coachs control and litigation with present or former employees.
As part of Coachs policing program for its intellectual property rights, from time to time, Coach files lawsuits in the U.S. and abroad alleging acts of trademark counterfeiting, trademark infringement, patent 14 TABLE OF CONTENTS infringement, trade dress infringement, trademark dilution and/or state or foreign law claims. At any given point in time, Coach may have a number of such actions pending. These actions often result in seizure of counterfeit merchandise and/or out of court settlements with defendants. From time to time, defendants will raise, either as affirmative defenses or as counterclaims, the invalidity or unenforceability of certain of Coachs intellectual properties.
Although Coachs litigation with present or former employees is routine and incidental to the conduct of Coachs business, as well as for any business employing significant numbers of employees, such litigation can result in large monetary awards when a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory and/or punitive damages for actions claiming discrimination on the basis of age, gender, race, religion, disability or other legally protected characteristic or for termination of employment that is wrongful or in violation of implied contracts.
Coach believes that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on Coachs business or consolidated financial statements.
Coach has not entered into any transactions that have been identified by the IRS as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose. Accordingly, we have not been required to pay a penalty to the IRS for failing to make disclosures required with respect to certain transactions that have been identified by the IRS as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose.

20 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of Coachs financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Coachs financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document. When used herein, the terms Coach, Company, we, us and our refer to Coach, Inc., including consolidated subsidiaries.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Coach is a leading American marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men. Our product offerings include womens and mens bags, accessories, business cases, footwear, wearables, jewelry, sunwear, travel bags, watches and fragrance. Coach operates in two segments: Direct-to-Consumer and Indirect. The Direct-to-Consumer segment includes sales to consumers through Company-operated stores in North America, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China, the Internet and Coach catalog. The Indirect segment includes sales to wholesale customers and distributors in over 20 countries, including the United States, and royalties earned on licensed product. As Coachs business model is based on multi-channel international distribution, our success does not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area.
In order to sustain growth within our global framework, we continue to focus on two key growth strategies: increased global distribution, with an emphasis on North America and China, and improved store sales productivity. To that end we are focused on five key initiatives:  Build market share in North Americas accessories market in part by growing our North American retail store base by opening stores in new markets and adding stores in under-penetrated existing markets. We believe that North America can support about 500 retail stores in total, including up to 30 in Canada. We expect to open about 15 net new retail stores and 25 factory outlets in fiscal 2012. The pace of our future retail store openings will depend upon the economic environment and will reflect opportunities in the marketplace. In addition, as part of our culture of innovation and continuous improvement, we have implemented a number of initiatives to accelerate the level of newness, elevate our product offering and enhance the in-store experience. These initiatives will enable us to maximize productivity and continue to leverage our leadership position in the market.
Raise brand awareness and build market share in markets in which Coach is under-penetrated, most notably in Asia, where China is our largest geographic opportunity as our brand awareness is increasing and the category is developing rapidly. We currently plan to open about 30 new locations in mainland China during fiscal 2012. Outside of Asia, we are developing the brand opportunity as we expand into Europe and South America.
Refocus on the Mens opportunity for the brand, globally, drawing on our long heritage in the category, notably in North America and Asia. We have implemented a number of initiatives to elevate our Mens product offering through image-enhancing and accessible locations. To this end, in fiscal 2012 our new store openings in North America and Japan will focus primarily on Mens factory and retail stores, while our new shops in China will be dual-gender locations. Specifically, we expect about half our North American retail store openings to be Mens locations and about 15 Mens-only factory stores.
Continue to expand market share with the Japanese consumer, driving growth in Japan primarily by opening new retail locations. We believe that Japan can support about 180 retail locations in total. We currently plan to open approximately 15 net new locations during fiscal 2012.
Raise brand awareness and build market share through our digital strategy, coach.com, our global e-commerce sites, marketing sites and social networking. The Company utilizes and continues to explore implementing new technologies such as our global web presence, with 17 informational websites in 18 countries with e-commerce enabled in the United States, Canada and Japan, social networking and blogs as cost-effective consumer communication opportunities to increase on-line and store sales.
21 TABLE OF CONTENTS We believe the growth strategies described above will allow us to deliver long-term superior returns on our investments and drive increased cash flows from operating activities. However, the current macroeconomic environment, while stabilizing, has created a challenging retail market in which consumers, notably in North America and Japan, are still cautious. The Company believes long-term growth can still be achieved through a combination of expanded distribution, a focus on innovation to support productivity and disciplined expense control. Our multi-channel distribution model is diversified and includes substantial international and factory businesses, which reduces our reliance upon our full-price U.S. business. With an essentially debt-free balance sheet and significant cash position, we believe we are well positioned to manage our business to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities while returning cash to shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends.
FISCAL 2011 The key metrics of fiscal 2011 were:  Earnings per diluted share rose 25.5% to $2.92.
Net sales increased 15.3% to $4.16 billion. The 53 rd week in fiscal 2010 contributed approximately $70 million of additional net sales.
Direct-to-consumer sales rose 14.8% to $3.62 billion.
Comparable sales in Coachs North American stores increased 10.6%, primarily due to improved conversion.
In North America, Coach opened three net new retail stores and 22 new factory stores, bringing the total number of retail and factory stores to 345 and 143, respectively, at the end of fiscal 2011. We also expanded six factory stores in North America.
Coach Japan opened eight net new locations, bringing the total number of locations at the end of fiscal 2011 to 169. In addition, we expanded three locations.
Coach China results continued to be strong with double-digit growth in comparable stores and channel profitability. At the end of fiscal 2011, we had a total of 66 locations.
Coachs Board increased the Companys cash dividend to an expected annual rate of $0.90 per share starting with the dividend paid on July 5, 2011.
As a result of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the Company estimates that sales in Japan were impacted by approximately $20 million and earnings per share by about two and a half cents during the third quarter and by approximately $26 million and about three and a half cents during the fourth quarter. Due to the events in Japan, as of the end of the fiscal year, two stores remained temporarily closed; these two stores reopened during July 2011.
22 TABLE OF CONTENTS FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010 The following table summarizes results of operations for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010: Fiscal Year Ended July 2, 2011 July 3, 2010 Variance (dollars in millions, except per share data) Amount % of net sales Amount % of net sales Amount % Net sales $ 4,158.5 100.0 % $ 3,607.6 100.0 % $ 550.9 15.3 % Gross profit 3,023.5 72.7 2,633.7 73.0 389.9 14.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,718.6 41.3 1,483.5 41.1 235.1 15.8 Operating income 1,304.9 31.4 1,150.2 31.9 154.8 13.5 Interest income, net 1.0 0.0 8.0 0.2 (6.9 ) (87.0 ) Provision for income taxes 420.4 10.1 423.2 11.7 (2.8 ) (0.7 ) Net income 880.8 21.2 734.9 20.4 145.9 19.8 Net Income per share: Basic $ 2.99 $ 2.36 $ 0.63 26.6 % Diluted 2.92 2.33 0.59 25.5 Net Sales The following table presents net sales by operating segment for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010: Fiscal Year Ended Net Sales Percentage of Total Net Sales July 2, 2011 July 3, 2010 Rate of Change July 2, 2011 July 3, 2010 (dollars in millions) (FY11 vs. FY10) Direct-to-Consumer $ 3,621.9 $ 3,155.8 14.8 % 87.1 % 87.5 % Indirect 536.6 451.8 18.8 12.9 12.5 Total net sales $ 4,158.5 $ 3,607.6 15.3 100.0 % 100.0 % 23 TABLE OF CONTENTS Direct-to-Consumer Net sales increased 14.8% to $3.62 billion during fiscal 2011 from $3.16 billion during fiscal 2010, driven by sales increases in our Company-operated stores in North America and China. Net sales of fiscal 2010 included an additional week of sales, which represented approximately $62 million.
Comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months, and includes sales from coach.com. Coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation. Similarly, stores that are expanded by 15.0% or more are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening. Stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base.
In North America, net sales increased 14.4% driven by sales from new and expanded stores and by a 10.6% increase in comparable store sales. During fiscal 2011, Coach opened three net new retail stores and 22 new factory stores, and expanded six factory stores in North America. In Japan, net sales increased 5.1% driven by an approximately $69.8 million, or 9.8%, positive impact from foreign currency exchange. During fiscal 2011, Coach opened eight net new locations and expanded three locations in Japan. Coach China results continued to be strong with double-digit percentage growth in comparable store sales. During fiscal 2011, Coach opened 25 net new stores in Hong Kong and mainland China.
Indirect Net sales increased 18.8% to $536.6 million from $451.8 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was driven primarily by an 18.4% increase in Coach International Wholesale and U.S. Wholesale net revenue. The net sales increase was partially offset by an additional week of sales in fiscal 2010, which represented approximately $8 million. Licensing revenue of approximately $24.7 million and $19.2 million in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively, is included in Indirect sales.
Operating Income Operating income increased 13.5% to $1.30 billion in fiscal 2011 as compared to $1.15 billion in fiscal 2010. Excluding items affecting comparability of $25.7 million in fiscal 2011, operating income increased 15.7% to $1.33 billion. Operating margin decreased to 31.4% as compared to 31.9% in the prior year, as gross margin decreased while selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses slightly increased as a percentage of sales. Excluding items affecting comparability, operating margin was 32.0% in fiscal 2011.
Gross profit increased 14.8% to $3.02 billion in fiscal 2011 from $2.63 billion in fiscal 2010. Gross margin was 72.7% in fiscal 2011 as compared to 73.0% during fiscal 2010. Coachs gross profit is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among, others may cause gross profit to fluctuate from year to year.
SG&A expenses are comprised of four categories: (1) selling; (2) advertising, marketing and design; (3) distribution and consumer service; and (4) administrative. Selling expenses include store employee compensation, store occupancy costs, store supply costs, wholesale account administration compensation and all Coach Japan and Coach China operating expenses. These expenses are affected by the number of Coach-operated stores in North America, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China open during any fiscal period and the related proportion of retail and wholesale sales. Advertising, marketing and design expenses include employee compensation, media space and production, advertising agency fees, new product design costs, public relations, market research expenses and mail order costs. Distribution and consumer service expenses include warehousing, order fulfillment, shipping and handling, customer service and bag repair costs. Administrative expenses include compensation costs for the executive, finance, human resources, legal and information systems departments, corporate headquarters occupancy costs, consulting and software expenses. SG&A expenses increase as the number of Coach-operated stores increase, although an increase in the number of stores generally results in the fixed portion of SG&A expenses being spread over a larger sales base.
During fiscal 2011, SG&A expenses increased 15.8% to $1.72 billion, compared to $1.48 billion during fiscal 2010. Excluding items affecting comparability of $25.7 million in fiscal 2011, SG&A expenses were $1.69 billion. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 41.3% and 41.1% during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Excluding items affecting comparability during fiscal 2011, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 40.7% as we leveraged our selling expense base on higher sales.
24 TABLE OF CONTENTS Selling expenses were $1.18 billion, or 28.5% of net sales compared to $1.05 billion, or 29.1% of net sales, during fiscal 2010. The dollar increase in selling expenses was due to higher operating expenses in Coach China and North American stores due to higher sales and new store openings. Additionally, selling expenses of Reed Krakoff stores contributed to the dollar increase since the brand was not launched until the beginning of fiscal 2011. Coach China and North American store expenses as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to operating efficiencies and sales leverage. The decrease in Coach Japan operating expenses in constant currency of $10.2 million was offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which increased reported expenses by approximately $33.5 million.
Advertising, marketing, and design costs were $224.4 million, or 5.4% of net sales, compared to $179.4 million, or 5.0% of net sales, during fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to new design expenditures and development costs for new merchandising initiatives. Also contributing to the increase were marketing expenses related to consumer communications, which includes our digital strategy through coach.com, our global e-commerce sites, marketing sites and social networking. The Company utilizes and continues to explore implementing new technologies such as our global web presence, with informational websites in 17 countries, social networking and blogs as cost-effective consumer communication opportunities to increase on-line and store sales and build brand awareness.
Distribution and consumer service expenses were $58.2 million, or 1.4% of net sales, compared to $48.0 million, or 1.3% of net sales, during fiscal 2010. To support our growth in China and the region, during the second half of fiscal 2010 we established an Asia distribution center in Shanghai, owned and operated by a third-party, allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region. During fiscal 2011, the Asia distribution center contributed to the increase in distribution and consumer service expenses; however in the long run, the Company expects the Asia distribution center to reduce costs as a percentage of net sales.
Administrative expenses were $252.4 million, or 6.1% of net sales, compared to $204.0 million, or 5.7% of net sales, during fiscal 2010. Excluding items affecting comparability of $25.7 million in fiscal 2011, expenses were $226.7 million, representing 5.5% of net sales. The increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to higher share-based and performance-based compensation.
Interest Income, Net Net interest income was $1.0 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $8.0 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease is attributable to lower returns on our investments due to lower investment balances during the year.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 32.3% in fiscal 2011 compared to 36.5% in fiscal 2010. Excluding the benefit from the items affecting comparability, the effective tax rate was 33.6% in fiscal 2011. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a favorable settlement of a multi-year tax return examination and higher profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions in which income is earned, due to the increased globalization of the Company, and a lower effective state tax rate.
Net Income Net income was $880.8 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $734.9 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was due to the higher operating income and a reduction of the effective tax rate.
25 TABLE OF CONTENTS FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009 The following table summarizes results of operations for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009: Fiscal Year Ended July 3, 2010 July 27, 2009 Variance (dollars in millions, except per share data) Amount % of net sales Amount % of net sales Amount % Net sales $ 3,607.6 100.0 % $ 3,230.5 100.0 % $ 377.2 11.7 % Gross profit 2,633.7 73.0 2,322.6 71.9 311.1 13.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,483.5 41.1 1,350.7 41.8 132.8 9.8 Operating income 1,150.2 31.9 971.9 30.1 178.3 18.3 Interest income, net 8.0 0.2 10.8 0.3 (2.8 ) (26.1 ) Provision for income taxes 423.2 11.7 359.3 11.1 63.9 17.8 Net income 734.9 20.4 623.4 19.3 111.6 17.9 Net Income per share: Basic $ 2.36 $ 1.93 $ 0.43 22.6 % Diluted 2.33 1.91 0.41 21.5 Net Sales The following table presents net sales by operating segment for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009: Fiscal Year Ended Net Sales Percentage of Total Net Sales July 3, 2010 July 27, 2009 Rate of Change July 3, 2010 July 27, 2009 (dollars in millions) (FY10 vs. FY09) Direct-to-Consumer $ 3,155.8 $ 2,726.9 15.7 % 87.5 % 84.4 % Indirect 451.8 503.6 (10.3 ) 12.5 15.6 Total net sales $ 3,607.6 $ 3,230.5 11.7 100.0 % 100.0 % Direct-to-Consumer Net sales increased 15.7% to $3.16 billion during fiscal 2010 from $2.73 billion during fiscal 2009, driven by sales increases in our Company-operated stores in North America and China. The net sales increase was also driven by an additional week of sales, which represented approximately $62 million.
Comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months, and includes sales from coach.com. Coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation. Similarly, stores that are expanded by 15.0% or more are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening. Stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base.
In North America, net sales increased 16.1% driven by sales from new and expanded stores and by a 3.5% increase in comparable store sales. During fiscal 2010, Coach opened 12 net new retail stores and 10 net new factory stores, and expanded five factory stores in North America. In Japan, net sales increased 7.8% driven by an approximately $51.9 million or 7.8% positive impact from foreign currency exchange. During fiscal 2010, Coach opened six net new locations and expanded two locations in Japan. The remaining change in net sales is attributable to Coach China, primarily as a result of the full year impact of the acquisitions of our retail businesses in Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China, new stores opened during fiscal 2010 and comparable store sales.
26 TABLE OF CONTENTS Indirect Net sales decreased 10.3% driven primarily by a 18.2% decrease in U.S. wholesale as the Company continued to control shipments into U.S. department stores in order to manage customer inventory levels due to a weak sales environment. The net sales decrease was partially offset by an additional week of sales, which represented approximately $8 million. We continue to experience better performance with international locations catering to indigenous consumers, where the brand is gaining recognition, whereas the Companys travel business has experienced weakness, as it is heavily dependent on the Japanese traveler. Licensing revenue of approximately $19.2 million and $19.5 million in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively, is included in Indirect sales.
Operating Income Operating income increased 18.3% to $1.15 billion in fiscal 2010 as compared to $971.9 million in fiscal 2009. Excluding items affecting comparability of $28.4 million in fiscal 2009, operating income increased 15.0% from $1.00 billion. Operating margin increased to 31.9% as compared to 30.1% in the prior year, as gross margin increased while SG&A expenses declined as a percentage of sales. Excluding items affecting comparability, operating margin was 31.0% in fiscal 2009.
Gross profit increased 13.4% to $2.63 billion in fiscal 2010 from $2.32 billion in fiscal 2009. Gross margin was 73.0% in fiscal 2010 as compared to 71.9% during fiscal 2009. The change in gross margin was driven primarily by lower manufacturing costs and product mix. Coachs gross profit is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in material costs. These factors among others may cause gross profit to fluctuate from year to year.
SG&A expenses are comprised of four categories: (1) selling; (2) advertising, marketing and design; (3) distribution and consumer service; and (4) administrative. Selling expenses include store employee compensation, store occupancy costs, store supply costs, wholesale account administration compensation and all Coach Japan and Coach China operating expenses. These expenses are affected by the number of Coach-operated stores in North America, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China open during any fiscal period and the related proportion of retail and wholesale sales. Advertising, marketing and design expenses include employee compensation, media space and production, advertising agency fees, new product design costs, public relations, market research expenses and mail order costs. Distribution and consumer service expenses include warehousing, order fulfillment, shipping and handling, customer service and bag repair costs. Administrative expenses include compensation costs for the executive, finance, human resources, legal and information systems departments, corporate headquarters occupancy costs, and consulting and software expenses. SG&A expenses increase as the number of Coach-operated stores increase, although an increase in the number of stores generally results in the fixed portion of SG&A expenses being spread over a larger sales base.
During fiscal 2010, SG&A expenses increased 9.8% to $1.48 billion, compared to $1.35 billion in fiscal 2009. Excluding items affecting comparability of $28.4 million in fiscal 2009, SG&A expenses were $1.32 billion. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 41.1% and 41.8% during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. Excluding items affecting comparability during fiscal 2009, selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 40.9%. Overall SG&A expenses increased primarily from higher administrative expenses driven by performance-based compensation and a prior year reversal of a straight-line rent accrual, resulting from the purchase of our corporate headquarters building that did not recur in fiscal 2010.
Selling expenses were $1.05 billion, or 29.1% of net sales, in fiscal 2010 compared to $981.5 million, or 30.4% of net sales, in fiscal 2009. Excluding items affecting comparability during fiscal 2009 of $5.0 million related to the planned closure of four underperforming stores during the stores lease terms, selling expenses were $976.5 million, representing 30.2% of net sales. The dollar increase in selling expenses was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of North American stores and Coach China. The increase in North American store expenses was primarily attributable to expenses from new and expanded stores opened during fiscal 2010 and the incremental expense associated with having a full year of expenses related to stores opened in the prior year. Coach China and North American store expenses as a percentage of sales decreased primarily attributable to operating efficiencies achieved since the end of the fiscal 2009. The increase in 27 TABLE OF CONTENTS Coach Japan operating expenses was driven primarily by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which increased reported expenses by approximately $22.0 million.
Advertising, marketing, and design costs were $179.4 million, or 5.0% of net sales, in fiscal 2010, compared to $163.6 million, or 5.1% of net sales, during fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to new design expenditures for the Reed Krakoff brand, with expected introductions in fiscal year 2011, partly offset by controlled sample making expenses.
Distribution and consumer service expenses were $48.0 million, or 1.3% of net sales, in fiscal 2010, compared to $52.2 million, or 1.6%, in fiscal 2009. The decrease in expenses was primarily the result of fiscal 2009 cost savings initiatives and process improvements.
Administrative expenses were $204.0 million, or 5.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2010 compared to $153.4 million, or 4.7% of net sales, during fiscal 2009. Excluding items affecting comparability of $23.4 in fiscal 2009, expenses were $130.0 million, representing 4.0% of net sales. The increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to higher performance-based and share-based compensation. Also during fiscal 2009, the Company reversed straight-line rent accruals resulting from the purchase of our corporate headquarters building during the lease period.
Interest Income, Net Net interest income was $8.0 million in fiscal 2010 compared to $10.8 million in fiscal 2009. The decrease is attributable to lower returns on our investments due to lower interest rates.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 36.5% in fiscal 2010 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2009. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a benefit of $18.8 million primarily related to favorable settlements of tax return examinations and certain other tax accounting adjustments. Excluding these benefits, the effective tax rate was 38.5% in fiscal 2009.
Net Income Net income was $734.9 million in fiscal 2010 compared to $623.4 million in fiscal 2009. Excluding items affecting comparability of $1.2 million in fiscal 2009, net income was $622.1 million in fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to operating income improvement partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes.
28 TABLE OF CONTENTS FISCAL 2011, FISCAL 2009 AND FISCAL 2008 ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS Non-GAAP Measures The Companys reported results are presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The reported SG&A expenses, operating income, and provision for income taxes in fiscal 2011 reflect certain items which affect the comparability of our results. Similarly, the reported SG&A expenses, operating income, provision for income taxes, income from continuing operations, net income and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 reflect certain items which affect the comparability of our results. These metrics are also reported on a non-GAAP basis for these fiscal years to exclude the impact of these items.
These non-GAAP performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected. Management and the Companys Board utilized these non-GAAP measures to make decisions about the uses of Company resources, analyze performance between periods, develop internal projections and measure management performance. The Companys primary internal financial reporting excluded these items affecting comparability. In addition, the compensation committee of the Companys Board used these non-GAAP measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals.
We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating the Companys ongoing operating and financial results and understanding how such results compare with the Companys historical performance. In addition, we believe excluding the items affecting comparability assists investors in developing expectations of future performance. These items affecting comparability do not represent the Companys direct, ongoing business operations. By providing the non-GAAP measures, as a supplement to GAAP information, we believe we are enhancing investors understanding of our business and our results of operations. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, U.S. GAAP financial measures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
29 TABLE OF CONTENTS The year-over-year comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items included in our reported results: Fiscal Year Ended (dollars in millions, except per share data) July 2, 2011 June 27, 2009 June 28, 2008 Operating income Cost savings measures $  $ (13.4 ) $  Charitable foundation contribution (25.7 ) (15.0 ) (20.0 ) Variable expense   (12.1 ) Total Operating income impact $ (25.7 ) $ (28.4 ) $ (32.1 ) Provision for income taxes Cost savings measures $  $ (5.1 ) $  Charitable foundation contribution (10.2 ) (5.7 ) (7.8 ) Tax adjustments (15.5 ) (18.8 ) (60.6 ) Variable expense   (4.7 ) Total Provision for income taxes impact $ (25.7 ) $ (29.6 ) $ (73.1 ) Net income Cost savings measures $  $ (8.3 ) $  Charitable foundation contribution (15.5 ) (9.3 ) (12.2 ) Tax adjustments 15.5 18.8 60.6 Variable expense   (7.4 ) Total Net income impact $ 0.0 $ 1.2 $ 41.0 Diluted earnings per share Cost savings measures $  $ (0.03 ) $  Charitable foundation contribution (0.05 ) (0.03 ) (0.03 ) Tax adjustments 0.05 0.06 0.17 Variable expense   (0.02 ) Total Diluted earnings per share impact $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.11 Fiscal 2011 Items Charitable Contributions and Tax Adjustments During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company decreased the provision for income taxes by $15.5 million, primarily as a result of a favorable settlement of a multi-year tax return examination. The Company used the net income favorability to contribute $20.9 million to the Coach Foundation and 400 million yen or $4.8 million to the Japanese Red Cross Society. The Company believed that in order to reflect the direct results of the normal, ongoing business operations, both the tax adjustments and the resulting Coach Foundation funding and Japanese Red Cross Society contribution needed to be adjusted. This exclusion is consistent with the way management views its results and is the basis on which incentive compensation will be calculated for fiscal 2011.
Fiscal 2009 Items Cost Savings Measures During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $13.4 million, related to cost savings initiatives. These initiatives included the elimination of approximately 150 positions from the Companys corporate offices in New York, New Jersey and Jacksonville, the closure of four underperforming retail stores and the closure of Coach Europe Services, the Companys sample-making facility in Italy. Prior to these cost savings measures in fiscal 2009, the Company had no recent past history of similar elimination of positions, closure of facilities, or closure of underperforming stores during the stores lease terms.
30 TABLE OF CONTENTS Charitable Contribution and Tax Adjustments During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company decreased the provision for income taxes by $18.8 million, primarily as a result of a favorable settlement of a multi-year tax return examination and other tax accounting adjustments. The underlying events and circumstances for the tax settlement and adjustments were not related to the fiscal 2008 settlement. The Company used the net income favorability to contribute $15.0 million to the Coach Foundation. The Company believed that in order to reflect the direct results of the normal, ongoing business operations, both the tax adjustments and the resulting foundation funding needed to be adjusted. This exclusion is consistent with the way management views its results and is the basis on which incentive compensation was calculated and paid for fiscal 2009.
Fiscal 2008 Items Charitable Contribution and Tax Adjustments During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company decreased the provision for income taxes by $60.6 million, primarily as a result of a favorable settlement of a tax return examination. The underlying events and circumstances for the tax settlement were not related to the fiscal 2009 settlement. The Company used the net income favorability to create the Coach Foundation. The Company recorded an initial contribution to the Coach Foundation in the amount of $20.0 million. The Company believed that in order to reflect the direct results of the business operations as was done for executive management incentive compensation, both the tax adjustments and the resulting foundation funding needed to be adjusted.
Variable Expenses As a result of the lower income tax provision, the Company incurred additional incentive compensation expense of $12.1 million, as a portion of the Companys incentive compensation plan is based on net income and earnings per share. Incremental incentive compensation driven by tax settlements of this magnitude is unlikely to recur in the near future as the Company has modified its incentive compensation plans during fiscal 2009 to be measured exclusive of any unusual accounting adjustments. The Company believes excluding these variable expenses, which were directly linked to the tax settlements, assists investors in evaluating the Companys direct, ongoing business operations.
Currency Fluctuation Effects Percentage increases and decreases in sales in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 for Coach Japan have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating foreign-denominated sales into U.S. dollars and comparing these figures to the same period in the prior fiscal year.
We believe that presenting Coach Japan sales increases and decreases, including and excluding currency fluctuation effects, will help investors and analysts to understand the effect on this valuable performance measure of significant year-over-year currency fluctuations.
31 TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash Flow Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.03 billion in fiscal 2011 compared to $990.9 million in fiscal 2010. The increase of $42.4 million was primarily due to the $145.9 million increase in net income as well as changes in deferred income taxes year-over-year, partially offset by working capital changes between the two periods, the most significant of which occurred in other assets and trade accounts receivable. Deferred income taxes were a source of cash of $39.7 million in fiscal 2011 compared to a use of cash of $17.1 million in fiscal 2010, due to the timing of deferred tax items. Other assets were a use of cash of $42.2 million in fiscal 2011 compared to a cash source of $35.6 million in fiscal 2010, primarily due to the timing of certain cash receipts. Trade accounts receivable were a use of cash of $31.8 million in fiscal 2011, compared to a cash source of $4.3 million in fiscal 2010, due to the timing of shipments to, and payments from, customers.
Net cash used in investing activities was $59.6 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $182.2 million in fiscal 2010. Purchases of investments and proceeds from their maturities and sales resulted in a net cash inflow in fiscal 2011 of $97.7 million, compared to a net cash outflow of $99.9 million in fiscal 2010. Additionally, purchases of property and equipment were $66.6 million higher in the current fiscal year, driven by the timing of certain projects and the Companys international expansion.
Net cash used in financing activities was $875.1 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to $1.02 billion in fiscal 2010. The decrease of $144.8 million was primarily attributable to $138.6 million of higher cash proceeds from share-based compensation awards during the current fiscal year. The Company spent approximately $1.10 billion on repurchases of common stock in both fiscal 2011and fiscal 2010.
Revolving Credit Facilities On July 26, 2007, the Company renewed its $100 million revolving credit facility with certain lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as the primary lender and administrative agent (the Bank of America facility), extending the facility expiration to July 26, 2012. At Coachs request and lenders consent, the Bank of America facility can be expanded to $200 million. The facility can also be extended for two additional one-year periods, at Coachs request and the lenders consent.
Coachs Bank of America facility is available for seasonal working capital requirements or general corporate purposes and may be prepaid without penalty or premium. During fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 there were no borrowings under the Bank of America facility. Accordingly, as of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Bank of America facility. The Companys borrowing capacity as of July 2, 2011 was $90.0 million, due to outstanding letters of credit.
Coach pays a commitment fee of 6 to 12.5 basis points on any unused amounts and interest of LIBOR plus 20 to 55 basis points on any outstanding borrowings. Both the commitment fee and the LIBOR margin are based on the Companys fixed charge coverage ratio. At July 2, 2011, the commitment fee was 7 basis points and the LIBOR margin was 30 basis points.
The Bank of America facility contains various covenants and customary events of default. Coach has been in compliance with all covenants since its inception.
To provide funding for working capital and general corporate purposes, Coach Japan has available credit facilities with several Japanese financial institutions. These facilities allow a maximum borrowing of 4.1 billion yen, or approximately $50.7 million, at July 2, 2011. Interest is based on the Tokyo Interbank rate plus a margin of 30 basis points. During fiscal 2011, the peak borrowings under the Japanese credit facilities were $27.1 million. There were no borrowings in fiscal 2010. As of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Japanese credit facilities.
To provide funding for working capital and general corporate purposes, Coach Shanghai Limited has a credit facility that allows a maximum borrowing of 63 million Chinese renminbi, or approximately $10 million at July 2, 2011. Interest is based on the Peoples Bank of China rate. During fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, the peak borrowings under this credit facility were $0 and $7.5 million. At July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility.
32 TABLE OF CONTENTS Common Stock Repurchase Program During fiscal 2011, the Company completed its $1.0 billion common stock repurchase program, which was put into place in April 2010. In January 2011, the Board approved a new common stock repurchase program to acquire up to $1.5 billion of Coachs outstanding common stock through June 2013. Purchases of Coach common stock are made subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices, through open market purchases. Repurchased shares become authorized but unissued shares and may be issued in the future for general corporate and other uses. The Company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time.
During fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased and retired 20.4 million and 30.7 million shares, respectively, or $1.10 billion and $1.15 billion of common stock, respectively, at an average cost of $53.81 and $37.48, respectively. As of July 2, 2011, $961.6 million remained available for future purchases under the existing program.
Liquidity and Capital Resources In fiscal 2011, total capital expenditures were $147.7 million related primarily to new stores and corporate infrastructure in North America, China, and Japan which accounted for approximately $42.5 million, $34.7, and $8.8 million, respectively, of total capital expenditures. Approximately $7.9 million related to investments in stores for Reed Krakoff which launched during fiscal 2011. Spending on department store renovations and distributor locations accounted for approximately $10.9 million of the total capital expenditures. The remaining capital expenditures related to corporate systems and infrastructure. These investments were financed from on hand cash and operating cash flows.
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, the Company expects total capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million. Capital expenditures will be primarily for new stores in North America; Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China; Japan; and Singapore and technology to support our global expansion. We will also continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and department store and distributor locations. These investments will be financed primarily from on hand cash and operating cash flows.
Coach experiences significant seasonal variations in its working capital requirements. During the first fiscal quarter Coach builds inventory for the holiday selling season, opens new retail stores and generates higher levels of trade receivables. In the second fiscal quarter its working capital requirements are reduced substantially as Coach generates consumer sales and collects wholesale accounts receivable. In fiscal 2011, Coach purchased approximately $1.2 billion of inventory, which was primarily funded by on hand cash and operating cash flows.
Management believes that cash flow from operations and on hand cash will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, dividend payments and the common stock repurchase program. Any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital. There can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to Coach on acceptable terms or at all. Coachs ability to fund its working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, dividend payments and scheduled debt payments, as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements, depends on its future operating performance and cash flow, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond Coachs control.
Commitments At July 2, 2011, the Company had credit available of $275.0 million, of which $171.9 million of letters of credit were outstanding. These letters of credit, which expire at various dates through 2014, primarily collateralize the Companys obligation to third parties for the purchase of inventory.
33 TABLE OF CONTENTS Contractual Obligations As of July 2, 2011, Coachs long-term contractual obligations are as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 Year 13 Years 35 Years More than 5 Years Total Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 20132014 Fiscal 20152016 Fiscal 2017 and beyond (amounts in millions) Capital expenditure commitments (1) $ 1.1 $ 1.1 $  $  $  Inventory purchase obligations (2) 195.4 195.4    Long-term debt, including the current portion (3) 24.2 0.8 22.9 0.5  Operating leases 1,019.3 152.9 288.4 227.3 350.7 Total $ 1,240.0 $ 350.2 $ 311.3 $ 227.8 $ 350.7 (1) Represents the Companys legally binding agreements related to capital expenditures.
(2) Represents the Companys legally binding agreements to purchase finished goods.
(3) Amounts presented include interest payment obligations.
The table above excludes the following: amounts included in current liabilities, other than the current portion of long-term debt, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at July 2, 2011 as these items will be paid within one year; long-term liabilities not requiring cash payments, such as deferred lease incentives; and cash contributions for the Companys pension plans. The Company intends to contribute approximately $0.4 million to its pension plans during the next year. The above table also excludes reserves recorded in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which has been codified within Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to these reserves.
Coach does not have any off-balance-sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Coachs risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The valuation of financial instruments that are marked-to-market are based upon independent third-party sources.
Long-Term Debt Coach is party to an Industrial Revenue Bond related to its Jacksonville, Florida distribution and consumer service facility. This loan has a remaining balance of $1.9 million and bears interest at 4.5%. Principal and interest payments are made semiannually, with the final payment due in 2014.
During fiscal 2009, Coach assumed a mortgage in connection with the purchase of its corporate headquarters building in New York City. This mortgage bears interest at 4.68%. Interest payments are made monthly and principal payments began in July 2009, with the final payment of $21.6 million due in June 2013. As of July 2, 2011, the remaining balance on the mortgage was $22.3 million.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. The development and selection of the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board.
The accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements. For more information on Coachs accounting policies, please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
34 TABLE OF CONTENTS Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which Coach operates. Deferred tax assets are reported at net realizable value, as determined by management. Significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate, in evaluating our tax positions and in determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets. In accordance with ASC 740-10, the Company recognizes the impact of tax positions in the financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax authorities periodically audit the Companys income tax returns. Management believes that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. A change in our tax positions or audit settlements could have a significant impact on our results of operations. For further information about income taxes, see the Income Taxes note presented in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inventories The Companys inventories are reported at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs include material, conversion costs, freight and duties and are determined by the first-in, first-out method. The Company reserves for slow-moving and aged inventory based on historical experience, current product demand and expected future demand. A decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes, buying patterns or increased competition could impact Coachs evaluation of its slow-moving and aged inventory and additional reserves might be required. At July 2, 2011, a 10% change in the reserve for slow-moving and aged inventory would have resulted in an insignificant change in inventory and cost of goods sold.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company evaluates goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment. In order to complete our impairment analysis, we must perform a valuation analysis which includes determining the fair value of the Companys reporting units based on discounted cash flows. This analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and estimate the profitability of future growth strategies. The Company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009.
Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related business. An impairment loss is recognized if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. The Company recorded an impairment loss in fiscal 2009 of $1.5 million related to the closure of three underperforming stores. The Company did not record any impairment losses in fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010. However, as the determination of future cash flows is based on expected future performance, impairment could result in the future if expectations are not met.
Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized at the point of sale, which occurs when merchandise is sold in an over-the-counter consumer transaction or, for the wholesale channels, upon shipment of merchandise, when title passes to the customer. Revenue associated with gift cards is recognized upon redemption. The Company estimates the amount of gift cards that will not be redeemed and records such amounts as revenue over the period of the performance obligation. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts and returns are provided when sales are recorded based upon historical experience and current trends. Royalty revenues are earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the Coach brand. Revenue earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported sales from the licensee. At July 2, 2011, a 10% change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts and returns would have resulted in an insignificant change in accounts receivable and net sales.
35 TABLE OF CONTENTS Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The grant-date fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions, including the expected term of the option, expected volatility and dividend yield. The expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Companys stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on Coachs stock. Dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and the Companys stock price. Changes in the assumptions used to determine the Black-Scholes value could result in significant changes in the Black-Scholes value. However, a 10% change in the Black-Scholes value would result in an insignificant change in fiscal 2011 share-based compensation expense.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Codification 820-10 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , (ASC 820-10) was amended in January 2010 to require additional disclosures related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires disclosure of transfers of assets and liabilities between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers, and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on December 27, 2009, except for certain disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to Level 3 fair value measurements, which were effective for the Company beginning on January 2, 2011. The disclosure guidance adopted on December 27, 2009 and January 2, 2011 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2011, ASC 820-10 was further amended to clarify certain disclosure requirements and improve consistency with international reporting standards. This amendment is to be applied prospectively and is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2012. The Company does not expect its adoption to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 220, Comprehensive Income , was amended in June 2011 to require entities to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendment does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income under current GAAP. This guidance is effective for the Companys fiscal year and interim periods beginning July 1, 2012. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance, but does not expect its adoption to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. Coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments with respect to Coach Japan and Coach Canada. The use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with Coachs risk management policies. Coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes.
The following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. These quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates.
36 TABLE OF CONTENTS Foreign Currency Exchange Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into U.S. dollars.
Substantially all of Coachs fiscal 2011 non-licensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the United States. These countries include China, United States, Italy, Hong Kong, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Macau, Philippines, Turkey, Colombia, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and Taiwan. Additionally, sales are made through international channels to third party distributors. Substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding consumer sales at Coach Japan, Coach Canada and Coach China, are denominated in U.S. dollars and, therefore, are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk.
In Japan and Canada, Coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from Coach Japan and Coach Canadas U.S. dollar denominated inventory purchases. Coach Japan and Coach Canada enter into certain foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily zero-cost collar options, to manage these risks. As of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of $171.0 million and $248.6 million, respectively, were outstanding.
Coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to Coach Japan as a result of its $109.1 million U.S. dollar-denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from Coach. To manage this risk, on June 30, 2011, Coach Japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction, the terms of which include an exchange of a yen fixed interest rate for a U.S. dollar fixed interest rate. The loan matures on December 29, 2011, at which point the swap requires an exchange of Japanese yen and U.S. dollar based notional values.
The fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010 was $2.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively. The fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities at July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010 was $1.7 million and $7.5 million, respectively. The fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in Japanese yen and Canadian dollar exchange rates.
Coach believes that exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and expenses of foreign operations, which are denominated in Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, Hong Kong dollar, Macau pataca and Canadian dollars, are not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Interest Rate Coach is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its investments, revolving credit facilities and long-term debt.
The Companys investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the Companys investment policy, which identifies allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. We do not hold any investments for trading purposes. The Companys investment portfolio consists of U.S. government and agency securities as well as corporate debt securities. As the Company does not have the intent to sell and will not be required to sell these securities until maturity, investments are classified as held-to-maturity and stated at amortized cost, except for auction rate securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. At July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, the Companys investments, classified as held-to-maturity, consisted of commercial paper and treasury bills valued at $2.3 million and $99.9 million, on those dates respectively. As the adjusted book value of the commercial paper and treasury bills equals its fair value, there were no unrealized gains or losses associated with these investments. At July 2, 2011, the Companys investments, classified as available-for-sale, consisted of a $6.0 million auction rate security. At July 2, 2011, as the auction rate securities adjusted book value equaled its fair value, there were no unrealized gains or losses associated with this investment.
37 TABLE OF CONTENTS As of July 2, 2011, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on its Bank of America facility, its revolving credit facility maintained by Coach Japan, and its revolving credit facility maintained by Coach Shanghai Limited. The fair value of any future borrowing may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
As of July 2, 2011, Coachs outstanding long-term debt, including the current portion, was $24.2 million. A hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of Coach.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on the evaluation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, each of Lew Frankfort, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Michael F.

Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. The Companys internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and Board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Management evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of July 2, 2011 and concluded that it is effective.
The Companys independent auditors have issued an audit report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The audit report appears on page 43 of this report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

41 TABLE OF CONTENTS REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coach, Inc.
New York, New York We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coach, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 2, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 2, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, effective July 4, 2010, the Company changed its method of accounting for presentation of interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions from classifying such amounts as a component of interest expense included within Interest income, net to classifying such amounts as a component of the provision for income taxes.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of July 2, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 19, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP New York, New York August 19, 2011 42 TABLE OF CONTENTS REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coach, Inc.
New York, New York We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Coach, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of July 2, 2011 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 2, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended July 2, 2011 of the Company and our report dated August 19, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule and includes an explanatory paragraph regarding the Companys change in method of accounting for presentation of interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions from classifying such amounts as a component of interest expense included within Interest income, net to classifying such amounts as a component of the provision for income taxes.

47 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS Coach, Inc. (the Company) designs and markets high-quality, modern American classic accessories. The Companys primary product offerings, manufactured by third-party suppliers, include womens and mens bags, accessories, business cases, footwear, wearables, jewelry, sunwear, travel bags, watches and fragrance. Coachs products are sold through the Direct-to-Consumer segment, which includes Company-operated stores in North America, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China, the Internet and the Coach catalog, and through the Indirect segment, which includes sales to wholesale customers and distributors in over 20 countries, including the United States, and royalties earned on licensed products.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to June 30. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in the financial statements relate to fiscal years. The fiscal years ended July 2, 2011 (fiscal 2011) and June 27, 2009 (fiscal 2009) were each 52-week periods. The fiscal year ended July 3, 2010 (fiscal 2010) was a 53-week period. The fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 (fiscal 2012) will be a 52-week period.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all 100% owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash balances and highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Investments Investments consist of U.S. government and agency debt securities as well as municipal government and corporate debt securities. Long-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
Short-term investments consist of commercial paper; the adjusted book value of the commercial paper equals its fair value. As the Company does not have the intent to sell and will not be required to sell these securities until maturity, investments are classified as held-to-maturity and stated at amortized cost.
In fiscal 2011, the Company participated in the organization of a joint venture. The Company has contributed a total of $9,559 in cash to the joint venture through July 2, 2011. This investment, which consists of a 50% equity interest, is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose Coach to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash investments 48 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) with high-credit quality financial institutions and currently invests primarily in U.S. government and agency debt securities, municipal government and corporate debt securities, and money market funds placed with major banks and financial institutions. Accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising Coachs customer base and their dispersion across many geographical regions. The Company believes no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these cash investments and accounts receivable.
Inventories Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost (determined by the first-in, first-out method) or market. Inventory costs include material, conversion costs, freight and duties.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings are depreciated over 40 years. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over lives of five to seven years and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over lives of three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease terms. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to earnings as incurred while expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Upon the disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts.
Operating Leases The Companys leases for office space, retail stores and the distribution facility are accounted for as operating leases. The majority of the Companys lease agreements provide for tenant improvement allowances, rent escalation clauses and/or contingent rent provisions. Tenant improvement allowances are recorded as a deferred lease credit on the balance sheet and amortized over the lease term, which is consistent with the amortization period for the constructed assets. Rent expense is recorded when the Company takes possession of a store to begin its build out, which generally occurs before the stated commencement of the lease term and is approximately 60 to 90 days prior to the opening of the store.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company performed an impairment evaluation in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 and concluded that there was no impairment of its goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related business. An impairment loss is recognized if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. The Company performed an impairment evaluation in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 and concluded that there was no impairment of its long-lived assets for stores expected to remain open. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $1,500 in fiscal 2009 related to the closure of three underperforming stores.
Stock Repurchase and Retirement Coach accounts for stock repurchases and retirements by allocating the repurchase price to common stock, additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings. The repurchase price allocation is based upon the equity contribution associated with historical issuances, beginning with the earliest issuance. Under Maryland 49 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) law, Coachs state of incorporation, treasury shares are not allowed. As a result, all repurchased shares are retired when acquired. During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Companys total cumulative stock repurchases exceeded the total shares issued in connection with the Companys October 2000 initial public offering, and stock repurchases in excess of this amount are assumed to be made from the Companys April 2001 Sara Lee exchange offer. Shares issued in connection with this exchange offer were accounted for as a contribution to common stock and retained earnings. Therefore, stock repurchases and retirements associated with the exchange offer are accounted for by allocation of the repurchase price to common stock and retained earnings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, cumulative stock repurchases allocated to retained earnings have resulted in an accumulated deficit balance. Since its initial public offering, the Company has not experienced a net loss in any fiscal year, and the net accumulated deficit balance in stockholders equity is attributable to the cumulative stock repurchase activity. The total cumulative amount of common stock repurchase price allocated to retained earnings as of July 2, 2011 was approximately $5,100,000.
Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized at the point of sale, which occurs when merchandise is sold in an over-the-counter consumer transaction or, for the wholesale channels, upon shipment of merchandise, when title passes to the customer. Revenue associated with gift cards is recognized upon redemption. The Company estimates the amount of gift cards that will not be redeemed and records such amounts as revenue over the period of the performance obligation. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts and returns are provided when sales are recorded. Royalty revenues are earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the Coach brand. Revenue earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported sales from the licensee. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenue.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of cost of merchandise, inbound freight and duty expenses, and other inventory-related costs such as shrinkage, damages, replacements and production overhead.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of four categories: (1) selling; (2) advertising, marketing and design; (3) distribution and consumer service; and (4) administrative. Selling expenses include store employee compensation, store occupancy costs, store supply costs, wholesale account administration compensation and all Coach Japan and Coach China operating expenses. Advertising, marketing and design expenses include employee compensation, media space and production, advertising agency fees, new product design costs, public relations, market research expenses and mail order costs. Distribution and consumer service expenses include warehousing, order fulfillment, shipping and handling, customer service and bag repair costs. Administrative expenses include compensation costs for the executive, finance, human resources, legal and information systems departments, corporate headquarters occupancy costs, and consulting and software expenses.
Preopening Costs Costs associated with the opening of new stores are expensed in the period incurred.
Advertising Advertising costs include expenses related to direct marketing activities, such as catalogs, as well as media and production costs. In fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, advertising expenses totaled $74,988, $61,241 and $50,078, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs are expensed when the advertising first appears.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Share-Based Compensation The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The grant-date fair value of the award is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period.
Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred were $31,522, $22,661 and $26,142 in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes . Under ASC 740, a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their respective tax bases. In evaluating the unrecognized tax benefits associated with the Companys various tax filing positions, management records these positions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in accordance with ASC 740. The Company classifies interest and penalties, if present, on uncertain tax positions in the Provision for income taxes. See the note on Change in Accounting Principle.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments As of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximated their values due to the short-term maturities of these accounts. The Company has evaluated its Industrial Revenue Bond and mortgage and believes, based on the interest rates, related terms and maturities, that the fair values of such instruments approximate their carrying amounts. See note on Fair Value Measurements for the fair values of the Companys investments as of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010.
Coach Japan and Coach Canada enter into foreign currency contracts that hedge certain U.S. dollar-denominated inventory purchases. Additionally, Coach Japan entered into a cross-currency swap transaction to hedge its fixed rate U.S. dollar denominated intercompany loan. These contracts qualify for hedge accounting and have been designated as cash flow hedges. The fair value of these contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings in the period in which the hedged item is also recognized in earnings. The fair value of the foreign currency derivative is based on its market value. Considerable judgment is required of management in developing estimates of fair value. The use of different market assumptions or methodologies could affect the estimated fair value.
Foreign Currency The functional currency of the Companys foreign operations is generally the applicable local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity.
Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is calculated similarly but includes potential dilution from the exercise of stock options and vesting of stock awards.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Subsequent Event Evaluation The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were issued, and concluded there were no events to recognize or disclose.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Codification 820-10 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , (ASC 820-10) was amended in January 2010 to require additional disclosures related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires disclosure of transfers of assets and liabilities between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers, and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on December 27, 2009, except for certain disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to Level 3 fair value measurements, which were effective for the Company beginning on January 2, 2011. The disclosure guidance adopted on December 27, 2009 and January 2, 2011 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2011, ASC 820-10 was further amended to clarify certain disclosure requirements and improve consistency with international reporting standards. This amendment is to be applied prospectively and is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2012. The Company does not expect its adoption to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 220, Comprehensive Income , was amended in June 2011 to require entities to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendment does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income under current GAAP. This guidance is effective for the Companys fiscal year and interim periods beginning July 1, 2012. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance, but does not expect its adoption to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
3. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The Company maintains several share-based compensation plans which are more fully described below. The following table shows the total compensation cost charged against income for these plans and the related tax benefits recognized in the income statement: Fiscal Year Ended July 2, 2011 July 3, 2010 June 27, 2009 Share-based compensation expense $ 95,830 $ 81,420 $ 67,542 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense 33,377 28,446 23,920 Coach Stock-Based Plans Coach maintains the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan to award stock options and shares to certain members of Coach management and the outside members of its Board of Directors (Board). Coach maintains the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2000 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan for awards granted prior to the establishment of the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan. These plans were approved by Coachs stockholders. The exercise price of each stock option equals 100% of the market price of Coachs stock on the date of grant and generally has a maximum term of 10 years. Stock options and share awards 52 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 3. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (continued) that are granted as part of the annual compensation process generally vest ratably over three years. Other stock option and share awards, granted primarily for retention purposes, are subject to forfeiture until completion of the vesting period, which ranges from one to five years. The Company issues new shares upon the exercise of stock options, vesting of share units and employee stock purchase.
For options granted under Coachs stock option plans prior to July 1, 2003, an active employee can receive a replacement stock option equal to the number of shares surrendered upon a stock-for-stock exercise. The exercise price of the replacement option equals 100% of the market value at the date of exercise of the original option and will remain exercisable for the remaining term of the original option. Replacement stock options generally vest six months from the grant date. No replacement stock options were granted in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009.
Stock Options A summary of option activity under the Coach stock option plans as of July 2, 2011 and changes during the year then ended is as follows: Number of Options Outstanding Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding at July 3, 2010 24,905 $ 30.87 Granted 3,598 39.57 Exercised (11,167 ) 32.00 Forfeited or expired (504 ) 39.04 Outstanding at July 2, 2011 16,832 31.73 6.1 $ 576,621 Vested or expected to vest at July 2, 2011 16,774 31.70 6.1 575,205 Exercisable at July 2, 2011 8,324 29.91 4.3 300,328 The fair value of each Coach option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted-average assumptions: Fiscal Year Ended July 2, 2011 July 3, 2010 June 27, 2009 Expected term (years) 3.3 3.0 3.0 Expected volatility 44.9 % 49.4 % 44.7 % Risk-free interest rate 1.0 % 1.7 % 2.7 % Dividend yield 1.5 % 1.0 % 0.0 % The expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Companys stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on Coachs stock. The risk free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury issue as of the date of the grant. Grants subsequent to the Companys April 2009 Board approval to initiate a quarterly dividend included a dividend yield assumption based on Coachs annual expected dividend divided by the grant-date share price.
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was $11.41, $9.68 and $8.36, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was $226,511, $127,879 and $11,495, respectively. The total cash received from option exercises was $357,344, $208,919 and $9,382 in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 3. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (continued) respectively, and the actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from these option exercises was $84,993, $47,795 and $4,427, respectively.
At July 2, 2011, $43,294 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.0 year.
Share Units The grant-date fair value of each Coach share unit is equal to the fair value of Coach stock at the grant date. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of shares granted during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was $40.31, $30.55 and $24.62, respectively. The following table summarizes information about non-vested shares as of and for the year ended July 2, 2011: Number of Non-Vested Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Nonvested at July 3, 2010 3,780 $ 29.40 Granted 2,080 40.31 Vested (1,331 ) 31.21 Forfeited (208 ) 32.96 Nonvested at July 2, 2011 4,321 33.81 The total fair value of shares vested during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was $58,359, $23,955 and $15,859, respectively. At July 2, 2011, $79,837 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, full-time Coach employees are permitted to purchase a limited number of Coach common shares at 85% of market value. Under this plan, Coach sold 120, 176 and 268 new shares to employees in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. Compensation expense is calculated for the fair value of employees purchase rights using the Black-Scholes model and the following weighted-average assumptions: Fiscal Year Ended July 2, 2011 July 3, 2010 June 27, 2009 Expected term (years) 0.5 0.5 0.5 Expected volatility 31.7 % 57.6 % 64.7 % Risk-free interest rate 0.2 % 0.2 % 1.1 % Dividend yield 1.3 % 1.0 %  % The weighted-average fair value of the purchase rights granted during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was $11.51, $9.15 and $8.42, respectively.
Deferred Compensation Under the Coach, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, Coachs outside directors may defer their directors fees. Amounts deferred under these plans may, at the participants election, be either represented by deferred stock units, which represent the right to receive shares of Coach common stock on the distribution date elected by the participant, or placed in an interest-bearing account to be paid on such distribution date. The amounts accrued under these plans at July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010 were $2,688 and $2,980, respectively, and are included within total liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
54 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 4. LEASES Coach leases certain office, distribution and retail facilities. The lease agreements, which expire at various dates through 2028, are subject, in some cases, to renewal options and provide for the payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance. Certain leases contain escalation clauses resulting from the pass-through of increases in operating costs, property taxes and the effect on costs from changes in consumer price indices. Certain rentals are also contingent upon factors such as sales.
Rent-free periods and scheduled rent increases are recorded as components of rent expense on a straight-line basis over the related terms of such leases. Contingent rentals are recognized when the achievement of the target (i.e., sales levels), which triggers the related payment, is considered probable. Rent expense for the Companys operating leases consisted of the following: Fiscal Year Ended July 2, 2011 July 3, 2010 June 27, 2009 Minimum rentals $ 129,110 $ 121,563 $ 107,272 Contingent rentals 77,795 59,806 43,995 Total rent expense $ 206,905 $ 181,369 $ 151,267 Future minimum rental payments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows: Fiscal Year Amount 2012 $ 152,871 2013 148,348 2014 140,032 2015 133,556 2016 93,785 Subsequent to 2016 350,671 Total minimum future rental payments $ 1,019,263 Certain operating leases provide for renewal for periods of five to ten years at their fair rental value at the time of renewal. In the normal course of business, operating leases are generally renewed or replaced by new leases.
5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS In accordance with ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , the Company categorized its assets and liabilities based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique into a three-level fair value hierarchy as set forth below. The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows: Level 1Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Coach currently does not have any Level 1 financial assets or liabilities.
Level 2Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in non-active markets, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3Unobservable inputs reflecting managements own assumptions about the input used in pricing the asset or liability.
55 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (continued) The following table shows the fair value measurements of the Companys assets and liabilities at July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010: Level 2 Level 3 July 2, 2011 July 3, 2010 July 2, 2011 July 3, 2010 Assets: Long-term investmentauction rate security (a) $  $  $ 6,000 $ 6,000 Derivative assetszero-cost collar options (b) 2,020 2,052   Total $ 2,020 $ 2,052 $ 6,000 $ 6,000 Liabilities: Derivative liabilitieszero-cost collar options (b) $ 1,062 $ 5,120 $  $  Derivative liabilitiescross-currency swap (c)   651 2,418 Total $ 1,062 $ 5,120 $ 651 $ 2,418 (a) The fair value of the security is determined using a model that takes into consideration the financial conditions of the issuer and the bond insurer, current market conditions and the value of the collateral bonds.
(b) The Company enters into zero-cost collar options to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from Coach Japans and Coach Canadas U.S. dollar-denominated inventory purchases. The fair value of these cash flow hedges is primarily based on the forward curves of the specific indices upon which settlement is based and includes an adjustment for the counterpartys or Companys credit risk.
(c) The Company is a party to a cross-currency swap transaction in order to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from Coach Japans U.S. dollar-denominated fixed rate intercompany loan. The fair value of this cash flow hedge is primarily based on the forward curves of the specific indices upon which settlement is based and includes an adjustment for the Companys credit risk.
See note on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for more information on the Companys derivative contracts.
As of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, the Companys investments included an auction rate security (ARS) classified as a long-term investment, as the auction for this security has been unsuccessful. The underlying investments of the ARS are scheduled to mature in 2035. We have determined that the significant majority of the inputs used to value this security fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the inputs are based on unobservable estimates. At both July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, the fair value of the Companys ARS was $6,000.
56 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (continued) As of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, the fair value of the Companys cross-currency swap derivatives were included within accrued liabilities. The Company uses a management model which includes a combination of observable inputs, such as tenure of the agreement and notional amount and unobservable inputs, such as the Companys credit rating. The table below presents the changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010: Cross-Currency Swaps Balance at July 3, 2010 $ 2,418 Settlement of cross-currency swap on June 30, 2011 (2,418 ) Unrealized loss on cross-currency swap maturing on December 29, 2011, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 651 Balance at July 2, 2011 $ 651 Balance at June 27, 2009 $ 36,118 Settlement of cross-currency swap on July 2, 2010 (36,118 ) Unrealized loss on cross-currency swap maturing on June 30, 2011, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 2,418 Balance at July 3, 2010 $ 2,418 The above settlement amounts for the cross-currency swaps on June 30, 2011 and July 2, 2010 are net of previously unrecognized losses recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income of $10,807 and $14,851 in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, prior to the respective settlement dates.
During fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, the Company purchased $224,007 and $229,860, respectively, of short-term investments consisting of U.S. treasury bills and commercial paper. These investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities, totaled $2,256 and $99,928 as of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, respectively, and are classified as held-to-maturity based on our positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. They are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair market value due to their short maturities.
6. DEBT Revolving Credit Facilities The Company maintains a $100,000 revolving credit facility with certain lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as the primary lender and administrative agent (the Bank of America facility). The facility expires on July 26, 2012. At Coachs request and lenders consent, the Bank of America facility can be expanded to $200,000 and can also be extended for two additional one-year periods. Under the Bank of America facility, Coach pays a commitment fee of 6 to 12.5 basis points on any unused amounts and interest of LIBOR plus 20 to 55 basis points on any outstanding borrowings. At July 2, 2011, the commitment fee was 7 basis points and the LIBOR margin was 30 basis points.
The Bank of America facility is available for seasonal working capital requirements or general corporate purposes and may be prepaid without penalty or premium. During fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 there were no borrowings under the Bank of America facility. Accordingly, as of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Bank of America facility. The Companys borrowing capacity as of July 2, 2011 was $89,993, due to outstanding letters of credit.
The Bank of America facility contains various covenants and customary events of default. Coach has been in compliance with all covenants since its inception.
57 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 6. DEBT (continued) To provide funding for working capital and general corporate purposes, Coach Japan has available credit facilities with several Japanese financial institutions. These facilities allow a maximum borrowing of 4.1 billion yen, or approximately $50,696, at July 2, 2011. Interest is based on the Tokyo Interbank rate plus a margin of 30 basis points. During fiscal 2011, the peak borrowings under the Japanese credit facilities were $27,119. There were no borrowings in fiscal 2010. As of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Japanese credit facilities.
To provide funding for working capital and general corporate purposes, Coach Shanghai Limited has a credit facility that allows a maximum borrowing of 63 million Chinese renminbi, or approximately $9,745 at July 2, 2011. Interest is based on the Peoples Bank of China rate. During fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, the peak borrowings under this credit facility were $0 and $7,496. At July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility.
Long-Term Debt Coach is party to an Industrial Revenue Bond related to its Jacksonville, Florida facility. This loan bears interest at 4.5%. Principal and interest payments are made semi-annually, with the final payment due in August 2014. As of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, the remaining balance on the loan was $1,860 and $2,245, respectively. During fiscal 2009, Coach assumed a mortgage in connection with the purchase of its corporate headquarters building in New York City. This mortgage bears interest at 4.68%. Interest payments are made monthly and principal payments began in July 2009, with the final payment of $21,555 due in June 2013. As of July 2, 2011, the remaining balance on the mortgage was $22,295. Future principal payments under these obligations are as follows: Fiscal Year Amount 2012 $ 795 2013 22,375 2014 500 2015 485 2016  Subsequent to 2016  Total $ 24,155 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES At July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, the Company had credit available of $275,000, of which letters of credit totaling $171,916 and $147,380, respectively, were outstanding. The letters of credit, which expire at various dates through 2014, primarily collateralize the Companys obligation to third parties for the purchase of inventory.
Coach is a party to employment agreements with certain key executives which provide for compensation and other benefits. The agreements also provide for severance payments under certain circumstances. The Companys employment agreements and the respective end of initial term dates are as follows: Executive Title Expiration Date (1) Lew Frankfort Chairman and Chief Executive Officer August 2011 Reed Krakoff President and Executive Creative Director June 2014 Michael Tucci President, North America Retail Division June 2013 (1) Once the initial term expires, these agreements automatically renew for successive one year terms unless either the employee or Board provides notice.
58 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (continued) In addition to the employment agreements described above, other contractual cash obligations as of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010 included $195,382 and $166,596, respectively, related to inventory purchase obligations and $1,087 and $1,611, respectively, related to capital expenditure purchase obligations.
In the ordinary course of business, Coach is a party to several pending legal proceedings and claims. Although the outcome of such items cannot be determined with certainty, Coachs general counsel and management are of the opinion that the final outcome will not have a material effect on Coachs cash flow, results of operations or financial position.
8. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties are denominated in U.S. dollars, which limits the Companys exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange risk related to Coach Japans and Coach Canadas U.S. dollar-denominated inventory purchases and Coach Japans $109,110 U.S. dollar-denominated fixed rate intercompany loan. Coach uses derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. These derivative transactions are in accordance with the Companys risk management policies. Coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes.
Coach Japan and Coach Canada enter into certain foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily zero-cost collar options, to manage the exchange rate risk related to their inventory purchases. As of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, $171,030 and $248,555 of foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding, respectively.
On July 1, 2005, to manage the exchange rate risk related to a $231,000 intercompany loan, Coach Japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction. The terms of the cross currency swap transaction included an exchange of a yen fixed interest rate for a U.S. dollar fixed interest rate and an exchange of yen and U.S. dollar-based notional values at maturity on July 2, 2010.
On July 2, 2010, Coach Japan repaid the loan, settled the cross currency swap, and entered into a new $139,400 intercompany loan agreement. Concurrently, Coach Japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction, the terms of which included an exchange of a yen fixed interest rate for a U.S. dollar fixed interest rate, requiring an exchange of yen and U.S. dollar based notional values at maturity on June 30, 2011.
On June 30, 2011, Coach Japan repaid the loan, settled the cross currency swap, and entered into a new $109,110 intercompany loan agreement with a maturity date of December 29, 2011. Similar to the previous loans, to manage the exchange rate risk, Coach Japan entered into a new cross currency swap transaction, the terms of which include an exchange of a yen fixed interest rate for a U.S. dollar fixed interest rate and an exchange of yen and U.S. dollar based notional values at maturity on December 29, 2011.
The Companys derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of gains or losses on the derivative instruments are reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of gains or losses on the derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings and are included within net cash provided by operating activities.

The Company expects that $2,356 of net derivative losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income at July 2, 2011 will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. This amount will vary due to fluctuations in the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar exchange rates.
Hedging activity affected accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, as follows: Year Ended July 2, 2011 July 3, 2010 Balance at beginning of period $ (2,092 ) $ (335 ) Net losses transferred to earnings 10,021 1,606 Change in fair value, net of tax (9,394 ) (3,363 ) Balance at end of period $ (1,465 ) $ (2,092 ) 60 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.

It is the Companys policy to establish provisions for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. The Company establishes the provisions based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with uncertain tax positions. The provisions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments to those provisions. All of these determinations are subject to the requirements of ASC 740.

INCOME TAXES (continued) A reconciliation of the beginning and ending gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Balance at beginning of fiscal year $ 165,676 $ 137,807 $ 131,185 Gross increase due to tax positions related to prior periods 5,225 3,903 13,690 Gross decrease due to tax positions related to prior periods (1,218 ) (971 ) (9,841 ) Gross increase due to tax positions related to current period 29,342 27,034 42,367 Decrease due to lapse of statutes of limitations (6,519 ) (1,692 ) (833 ) Decrease due to settlements with taxing authorities (30,446 ) (405 ) (38,761 ) Balance at end of fiscal year $ 162,060 $ 165,676 $ 137,807 Of the $162,060 ending gross unrecognized tax benefit balance, $79,370 relates to items which, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. As of July 2, 2011 and July 3, 2010, gross interest and penalties payable was $35,258 and $35,331, which are included in other liabilities. During fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, the Company recognized interest and penalty (income) expense of $(3,195), $6,204 and $5,611, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. Fiscal years 2008 to present are open to examination in the federal jurisdiction, fiscal 2004 to present in significant state jurisdictions, and from fiscal 2004 to present in foreign jurisdictions. During the fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2009, the Company decreased the provision for income taxes primarily as a result of a favorable settlement of a multi-year tax return examination.
Based on the number of tax years currently under audit by the relevant tax authorities, the Company anticipates that one or more of these audits may be finalized in the foreseeable future. However, based on the status of these examinations, and the protocol of finalizing audits by the relevant tax authorities, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of any amount of such changes in the next 12 months, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions.
At July 2, 2011, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards in foreign tax jurisdictions of $100,393, which will expire beginning in fiscal years 2013 through fiscal year 2017.
The total amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of July 2, 2011 was $941,859. It is the Companys intention to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and thereby indefinitely postpone their remittance. Accordingly, no provision has been made for foreign withholding taxes or United States income taxes which may become payable if undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are paid as dividends.
11. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN Coach maintains the Coach, Inc. Savings and Profit Sharing Plan, which is a defined contribution plan. Employees who meet certain eligibility requirements and are not part of a collective bargaining agreement may participate in this program. The annual expense incurred by Coach for this defined contribution plan was $16,029, $13,285 and $12,511 in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 12. SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company operates its business in two reportable segments: Direct-to-Consumer and Indirect. The Companys reportable segments represent channels of distribution that offer similar merchandise, service and marketing strategies. Sales of Coach products through Company-operated stores in North America, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China, the Internet and the Coach catalog constitute the Direct-to-Consumer segment. The Indirect segment includes sales to wholesale customers and distributors in over 20 countries, including the United States, and royalties earned on licensed products. In deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance, Coachs executive officers regularly evaluate the sales and operating income of these segments. Operating income is the gross margin of the segment less direct expenses of the segment. Unallocated corporate expenses include production variances, general marketing, administration and information systems, as well as distribution and consumer service expenses.
In connection with the acquisitions of the retail businesses in Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China, the Company evaluated the composition of its reportable segments and concluded that sales in these regions should be included in the Direct-to-Consumer segment.

They had previously been classified within Interest income, net. Previously reported amounts for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 have been restated to reflect this change.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 16. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE Coach adopted the FASBs guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, codified within ASC 740 Income Taxes, on July 1, 2007, the first day of fiscal 2008. At adoption, Coach elected to classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of interest expense included within Interest income, net. On July 4, 2010, the Company changed its method of accounting to include such amounts as a component of the provision for income taxes. The Company believes this change is preferable because: it will improve Coachs comparability with its industry peers; it is more consistent with the way in which the Company manages the settlement of uncertain tax positions as one overall amount inclusive of interest and penalties; and it will provide more meaningful information to investors by including only interest expense related to revolving credit facilities and long-term debt financing activities within Interest income, net.
The change in accounting method for presentation of interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions was completed in accordance with ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections . Accordingly, the change in accounting principle has been applied retrospectively by adjusting the financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented. The change to current or historical periods presented herein due to the change in accounting principle was limited to income statement classification, with no effect on net income.
The following tables detail the retrospective application impact on previously reported amounts: For the Year Ended July 3, 2010 As Previously Reported Effect of Accounting Principle Change Adjusted Interest income, net $ 1,757 $ 6,204 $ 7,961 Provision for income taxes 416,988 6,204 423,192 For the Year Ended June 27, 2009 Interest income, net $ 5,168 $ 5,611 $ 10,779 Provision for income taxes 353,712 5,611 359,323 The following table shows the impact of the accounting principle change on reported balances for the year ended July 2, 2011: For the Year Ended July 2, 2011 As Computed Under Prior Method Effect of Accounting Principle Change As Reported Under Current Method Interest income, net $ 4,226 (3,195 ) $ 1,031 Provision for income taxes 423,614 (3,195 ) 420,419 67 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.

ACQUISITIONS On September 1, 2008, Coach acquired 100% of its domestic retail businesses in Hong Kong and Macau and on April 1, 2009, acquired 100% of its domestic retail business in mainland China from the former distributor, the ImagineX group. The results of the acquired businesses have been included in the consolidated financial statements since September 1, 2008 and April 1, 2009, respectively, within the Direct-to-Consumer segment. These acquisitions provide the Company with greater control over the brand in Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China, enabling Coach to raise brand awareness and aggressively grow market share with the Chinese consumer.
The aggregate purchase price of the Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China businesses was $25,600, of which $24,400 was paid during fiscal 2009 and $1,200 was paid during fiscal 2010. The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired at the dates of acquisition: Assets Acquired Fair Value of Hong Kong and Macau (1) Fair Value of Mainland China (2) Total Current assets $ 5,099 $ 4,868 $ 9,967 Fixed assets 3,555 3,525 7,080 Other assets 2,299  2,299 Goodwill 3,554 2,700 6,254 Total assets acquired $ 14,507 $ 11,093 $ 25,600 (1) Fair value as of the acquisition date of September 1, 2008 (2) Fair value as of the acquisition date of April 1, 2009 Prior to these acquisitions, the ImagineX group operated eight retail and department store locations in Hong Kong, two retail locations in Macau, and 15 retail locations in mainland China. The strength of the going concern and the established locations supported a premium above the fair value of the individual assets acquired. Unaudited pro forma information related to these acquisitions is not included as the impact of these transactions is not material to the consolidated results of the Company.
