PART I Item 1. Business General Development of Business Founded in 1941, Coach was acquired by Sara Lee Corporation (Sara Lee) in 1985. In June 2000, Coach was incorporated in the state of Maryland. In October 2000, Coach was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and sold approximately 68 million shares of common stock, split adjusted, representing 19.5% of the outstanding shares. In April 2001, Sara Lee completed a distribution of its remaining ownership in Coach via an exchange offer, which allowed Sara Lee stockholders to tender Sara Lee common stock for Coach common stock.
In June 2001, Coach Japan, Inc. (Coach Japan) was formed to expand our presence in the Japanese market and to exercise greater control over our brand in that country. Coach Japan was initially formed as a joint venture with Sumitomo Corporation. On July 1, 2005, we purchased Sumitomos 50% interest in Coach Japan, resulting in Coach Japan becoming a 100% owned subsidiary of Coach, Inc.
In March 2007, the Company exited its corporate accounts business in order to better control the location and image of the brand where Coach product is sold. Through the corporate accounts business, Coach sold products primarily to distributors for gift-giving and incentive programs. The results of the corporate accounts business, previously included in the Indirect segment, have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented.
Financial Information about Segments Segment information is presented in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Narrative Description of Business Coach has grown from a family-run workshop in a Manhattan loft to a leading American marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men. Coach is one of the most recognized fine accessories brands in the U.S. and in targeted international markets. We offer premium lifestyle accessories to a loyal and rapidly growing customer base and provide consumers with fresh, relevant and innovative products that are extremely well made, at an attractive price. Coachs modern, fashionable handbags and accessories use a broad range of high quality fabrics and materials. In response to our customers demands for both fashion and function, Coach offers updated styles and multiple product categories which address an increasing portion of our customers accessory wardrobe. Coach has created a sophisticated, modern and inviting environment to showcase our product assortment and reinforce a consistent brand position wherever the consumer may shop. Finally, we utilize a flexible, cost-effective global sourcing model, in which independent manufacturers supply our products, allowing us to bring our broad range of products to market rapidly and efficiently.
Coach offers a number of key differentiating elements that set it apart from the competition, including: A Distinctive Brand Coach offers distinctive, easily recognizable, accessible luxury products that are relevant, extremely well made and provide excellent value.
A Market Leadership Position With Growing Share Coach is Americas leading premium handbag and accessories brand and each year, as our market share increases, our leadership position strengthens.
Coachs Loyal And Involved Consumer Coach consumers have a specific emotional connection with the brand. Part of the Companys everyday mission is to cultivate consumer relationships by strengthening this emotional connection.
3 TABLE OF CONTENTS Multi-Channel International Distribution This allows Coach to maintain a critical balance as results do not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area. The Direct-to-Consumer channel provides us with immediate, controlled access to consumers through Coach-owned stores in North America and Japan, the Internet and the Coach catalog. The Indirect channel provides us with access to consumers via U.S. and international wholesale locations.
Coach Is Innovative And Consumer-Centric Coach listens to its consumer through rigorous consumer research and strong consumer orientation. Coach works to anticipate the consumers changing needs by keeping the product assortment fresh and relevant.
We believe that these differentiating elements have enabled the Company to offer a unique proposition to the marketplace. We hold the number one position within the U.S. premium handbag and accessories market and the number two position within the Japanese imported luxury handbag and accessories market.
Products Coachs product offerings include handbags, womens and mens accessories, footwear, outerwear, business cases, sunwear, watches, travel bags, jewelry and fragrance. The following table shows the percent of net sales that each product category represented: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 Handbags 64 % 65 % 65 % Accessories 28 28 27 All other products 8 7 8 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Handbags Handbag collections feature classically inspired designs as well as fashion designs. Typically, there are three to four collections per quarter and four to seven styles per collection. Periodically, we also offer new lifestyle collections, which are collections designed to meet the fashion and functional requirements of our broad and diverse consumer base. During fiscal 2007, we introduced three major lifestyle collections: Signature Stripe, Legacy and Ergo. In fiscal 2008, we plan to introduce three additional major lifestyle collections: Bleecker, Heritage Stripe and Soho.
Accessories Accessories include womens and mens small leather goods, novelty accessories and womens and mens belts. Womens small leather goods, which coordinate with our handbags, include money pieces, wristlets, and cosmetic cases. Mens small leather goods consist primarily of wallets and card cases. Novelty accessories include electronic, time management and pet accessories. Key fobs and charms are also included in this category.
Footwear Jimlar Corporation (Jimlar) has been Coachs footwear licensee since 1999. Footwear is distributed through over 700 locations in the U.S., including leading Coach retail stores and U.S. department stores. Footwear sales are comprised primarily of womens styles, which coordinate with Coachs handbag collections.
Outerwear This category includes jackets, sweaters, gloves, hats and scarves. The assortment is primarily womens and contains a fashion assortment in all components of this category.
Business Cases This assortment is primarily mens and includes computer bags, messenger-style bags and totes.

Coach sunglasses are sold in Coach retail stores, department stores, select sunglass retailers and optical retailers in major markets.
Watches Movado Group, Inc. (Movado) has been Coachs watch licensee since 1998 and has developed a distinctive collection of watches inspired primarily by the womens collections with select mens styles.
4 TABLE OF CONTENTS Travel Bags The travel collections are comprised of luggage and related accessories, such as travel kits and valet trays.
Jewelry In November 2006, Coach launched a jewelry line, consisting primarily of bangle bracelets. The Company plans to expand this category by introducing sterling silver, glass and gold plated brass pieces in fiscal 2008.
Fragrance In March 2007, Coach launched its first fragrance in partnership with Beauty Bank, a division of Estee Lauder, Inc. This collection includes a perfume spray, a purse spray and a perfume solid and is sold exclusively in Coach stores and on the Coach internet site. The Company plans to expand this category by introducing body lotions in fiscal 2008.
Design and Merchandising Coachs New York-based design team, led by its Executive Creative Director, is responsible for conceptualizing and directing the design of all Coach products. Designers have access to Coachs extensive archives of product designs created over the past 65 years, which are a valuable resource for new product concepts. Coach designers are also supported by a strong merchandising team that analyzes sales, market trends and consumer preferences to identify business opportunities that help guide each seasons design process. Merchandisers also analyze products to edit, add and delete to achieve profitable sales across all channels. The product category teams, each comprised of design, merchandising/product development and sourcing specialists, help Coach execute design concepts that are consistent with the brands strategic direction.
Coachs design and merchandising teams work in close collaboration with all of our licensing partners to ensure that the licensed products (watches, footwear and eyewear) are conceptualized and designed to address the intended market opportunity and convey the distinctive perspective and lifestyle associated with the Coach brand.
Segments Coach operates in two reportable segments: Direct-to-Consumer and Indirect. The reportable segments represent channels of distribution that offer similar products, service and marketing strategies.
Direct-to-Consumer Segment The Direct-to-Consumer segment consists of channels that provide us with immediate, controlled access to consumers: retail stores and factory stores in North America and Japan, the Internet and Coach catalogs. This segment represented approximately 80% of Coachs total net sales in fiscal 2007, with North American stores and Coach Japan contributing approximately 58% and 18% of total net sales, respectively.
North American Retail Stores Coach stores are located in upscale regional shopping centers and metropolitan areas. The retail stores carry an assortment of products depending on their size and location. Our flagship stores, which offer the broadest assortment of Coach products, are located in high-visibility locations such as New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
Our stores are sophisticated, sleek, modern and inviting. They showcase the world of Coach and enhance the shopping experience while reinforcing the image of the Coach brand. The modern store design creates a distinctive environment to display our products. Store associates are trained to maintain high standards of visual presentation, merchandising and customer service. The result is a complete statement of the Coach modern American style at the retail level.
5 TABLE OF CONTENTS The following table shows the number of Coach retail stores and their total and average square footage: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 Retail stores 259 218 193 Net increase vs. prior year 41 25 19 Percentage increase vs. prior year 18.8 % 13.0 % 10.9 % Retail square footage 672,737 562,553 490,925 Net increase vs. prior year 110,184 71,628 59,308 Percentage increase vs. prior year 19.6 % 14.6 % 13.7 % Average square footage 2,597 2,581 2,544 North American Factory Stores Coachs factory stores serve as an efficient means to sell manufactured-for-factory-store product, including factory exclusives, as well as discontinued and irregular inventory outside the retail channel. These stores operate under the Coach Factory name and are geographically positioned primarily in established centers that are generally more than 50 miles from major markets.
Coachs factory store design, visual presentations and customer service levels support and reinforce the brands image. Through these factory stores, Coach targets value-oriented customers who would not otherwise buy the Coach brand. Prices are generally discounted from 10% to 50% below full retail prices.
The following table shows the number of Coach factory stores and their total and average square footage: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 Factory stores 93 86 82 Net increase vs. prior year 7 4 6 Percentage increase vs. prior year 8.1 % 4.9 % 7.9 % Factory square footage 321,372 281,787 252,279 Net increase vs. prior year 39,585 29,508 20,924 Percentage increase vs. prior year 14.0 % 11.7 % 9.0 % Average square footage 3,456 3,277 3,077 Coach Japan, Inc.
Coach Japan operates department store shop-in-shop locations as well as freestanding flagship, retail and factory stores. Flagship stores, which offer the broadest assortment of Coach products, are located in select shopping districts throughout Japan.
The following table shows the number of Coach Japan locations and their total and average square footage: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 Coach Japan locations 137 118 103 Net increase vs. prior year 19 15 3 Percentage increase vs. prior year 16.1 % 14.6 % 3.0 % Coach Japan square footage 229,862 194,375 161,632 Net increase vs. prior year 35,487 32,743 42,341 Percentage increase vs. prior year 18.3 % 20.3 % 35.5 % Average square footage 1,678 1,647 1,569 6 TABLE OF CONTENTS Internet Coach views its website as a key communications vehicle for the brand to promote traffic in Coach retail stores and department store locations and build brand awareness. Our online store provides a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a selected offering of the latest styles and colors. During fiscal 2007, our Internet business generated net sales of approximately $82 million, up 51% from prior year. The growth in the Internet business was driven by the strength of the Coach brand as well as advertising and email contacts. In fiscal 2007, there were approximately 50 million unique visits to the website. In addition, the Company sent approximately 47 million emails to strategically selected customers as we continue to evolve our internet outreach to maximize productivity while streamlining distribution. Revenue from Internet sales is recognized upon shipment of the product.
Coach Catalog In fiscal 2007, the Company distributed approximately 7 million catalogs in Coach stores in North America and Japan and mailed approximately 3 million catalogs to strategically selected North American households from its database of customers. Over the past few years, Coach has reduced catalog mailings in favor of more cost effective means of communication, notably emails. While direct mail sales comprise a small portion of Coachs net sales, Coach views its catalog as a key communications vehicle for the brand because it promotes store traffic, facilitates the shopping experience in Coach retail stores and builds brand awareness. As an integral component of our communications strategy, the graphics, models and photography are upscale and modern and present the product in an environment consistent with the Coach brand. The catalogs highlight selected products and serve as a reference for customers, whether ordering through the catalog, making in-store purchases or purchasing over the Internet.
Indirect Segment Coach began as a U.S. wholesaler to department stores and this segment remains important to our overall consumer reach. Today, we work closely with our partners, both domestic and international, to ensure a clear and consistent product presentation. The Indirect segment represented approximately 20% of total net sales in fiscal 2007, with U.S. Wholesale and International Wholesale representing approximately 12% and 5% of total net sales, respectively.
U.S. Wholesale This channel offers access to Coach products to consumers who prefer shopping at department stores or who live in markets with no Coach store. While overall U.S. department store sales have not increased over the last few years, the handbag and accessories category has remained strong, in large part due to the strength of the Coach brand. Net sales to U.S. wholesale customers grew 31% in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006.
Coach recognizes the continued importance of U.S. department stores as a distribution channel for premier accessories. Department stores also continue to devote increased square footage to Coach, providing an additional driver to this channels growth. We continue to fine-tune our strategy to increase productivity and drive volume by enhancing presentation, primarily through the creation of more shop-in-shops, and the introduction of caseline enhancements with proprietary Coach fixtures, while exiting lower performing doors and working with the department stores to re-allocate their Coach spending to higher volume locations. Coach has also improved wholesale product planning and allocation processes by custom tailoring assortments to better match the attributes of our department store consumers in each local market.
Coachs products are sold in approximately 900 wholesale locations in the U.S. and Canada. Our most significant U.S. wholesale customers are Macys, Inc. (including Bloomingdales), Dillards, Nordstrom, Saks, Inc., Carsons and Lord and Taylor.
International Wholesale This channel represents sales to international wholesale distributors and authorized retailers. Japanese tourists represent the largest portion of our customers sales in this channel. However, we continue to drive growth by expanding our distribution to reach local consumers in emerging markets. Coach has developed relationships with a select group of distributors who sell Coach products through department stores and freestanding retail locations in 21 countries. Coachs current network of international distributors serves the following markets: Korea, the United States (primarily Hawaii and Guam), Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, China, the Caribbean, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, New Zealand, Indonesia and France. For locations not in freestanding stores, Coach has created shop-in-shops and other image enhancing environments to increase brand appeal and stimulate growth. Coach continues to improve productivity in this channel by opening larger image-enhancing 7 TABLE OF CONTENTS locations, expanding existing stores and closing smaller, less productive stores. Coachs most significant international wholesale customers are the DFS Group, Lotte Group, Tasa Meng Corp., Shilla Group, Imaginex and Shinsegae International.
The following table shows the number of international wholesale locations at which Coach products are sold: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 International freestanding stores 37 21 14 International department store locations 74 63 58 Other international locations 29 24 22 Total international wholesale locations 140 108 94 Licensing In our licensing relationships, Coach takes an active role in the design process and controls the marketing and distribution of products under the Coach brand. The current licensing relationships as of June 30, 2007 are as follows: Category Licensing Partner Introduction Date Territory License Expiration Date Watches Movado Spring 98 U.S. and Japan 2008 Footwear Jimlar Spring 99 U.S.
2008 Eyewear Marchon Fall 03 Worldwide 2011 Products made under license are, in most cases, sold through all of the channels discussed above and, with Coachs approval, these licensees have the right to distribute Coach brand products selectively through several other channels: shoes in department store shoe salons, watches in selected jewelry stores and eyewear in selected optical retailers. These venues provide additional, yet controlled, exposure of the Coach brand. Coachs licensing partners pay royalties to Coach on their net sales of Coach branded products. However, such royalties are not material to the Coach business as they currently comprise less than 1% of Coachs total revenues. The licensing agreements generally give Coach the right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are not achieved.
Marketing Coachs marketing strategy is to deliver a consistent message each time the consumer comes in contact with the Coach brand, through our communications and visual merchandising. The Coach image is created internally and executed by the creative marketing, visual merchandising and public relations teams. Coach also has a sophisticated consumer and market research capability, which helps us assess consumer attitudes and trends and gauge the likelihood of a products success in the marketplace prior to its introduction.
In conjunction with promoting a consistent global image, Coach uses its extensive customer database and consumer knowledge to target specific products and communications to specific consumers to efficiently stimulate sales across all distribution channels.
Coach engages in several consumer communication initiatives, including direct marketing activities and national, regional and local advertising. In fiscal 2007, consumer contacts increased 4% to over 114 million. However, the Company continues to leverage marketing expenses by refining our marketing programs to increase productivity and optimize distribution. Total expenses related to consumer communications in fiscal 2007 were $47 million, representing less than 2% of net sales.
Coachs wide range of direct marketing activities includes catalogs, brochures and email contacts, targeted to promote sales to consumers in their preferred shopping venue. In addition to building brand awareness, Coach catalogs and www.coach.com serve as effective brand communications vehicles by providing a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a strategic offering of the latest styles and colors, which drives store traffic.
8 TABLE OF CONTENTS As part of Coachs direct marketing strategy, it uses its database consisting of approximately 12 million active North American households. Catalogs and email contacts are Coachs principal means of communication and are sent to selected households to stimulate consumer purchases and build brand awareness. The rapidly growing number of visitors to the www.coach.com online store provides an opportunity to increase the size of this database.
The Company also runs national, regional and local advertising campaigns, primarily print and outdoor advertising, in support of its major selling seasons.
Manufacturing All of our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers. However, we maintain control of the supply chain from design through manufacture. We are able to do this by qualifying all raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing offices in Hong Kong, China and South Korea that work closely with our independent manufacturers. Coach also operates a European sourcing and product development organization based in Florence, Italy that works closely with the New York design team. This broad-based, multi-country manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost, lead times and construction capabilities. We have increased the presence of our senior management at the manufacturers facilities to enhance control over decision making and ensure the speed with which we bring new product to market is maximized.
These independent manufacturers support a broader mix of product types, materials and a seasonal influx of new, fashion oriented styles, which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. During fiscal 2007, approximately 73% of Coachs total net sales were generated from products introduced within the fiscal year. As the collections are seasonal and planned to be sold in stores for short durations, our production quantities are limited which limits our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory.
All product sources, including independent manufacturers and licensing partners, must achieve and maintain Coachs high quality standards, which are an integral part of the Coach identity. One of Coachs keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials. Coach has longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware. As Coach has moved its production to external sources, it has maintained control of the raw materials that are used in all of its products, wherever they are made. Compliance with quality control standards is monitored through on-site quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities.
Coach carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of better brand partners with demonstrated integrity, quality and reliable delivery. Our manufacturers are located in many countries, including China, the United States, India, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Mauritius, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan and Turkey. No one vendor provides more than 13% of Coachs total units. Before partnering with a vendor, Coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit. Periodic evaluations of existing, previously approved facilities are conducted on a random basis. We believe that all of our manufacturing partners are in compliance with Coachs integrity standards.
Distribution Coach operates a distribution and consumer service facility in Jacksonville, Florida. This automated, 560,000 square foot facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse management system. Coachs distribution center employees use handheld radio frequency scanners to read product bar codes, which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders, track shipments, manage inventory and generally provide better service to our customers. Coachs products are primarily shipped to Coach retail stores and wholesale customers via Federal Express and common carrier, and direct to consumers via Federal Express.
Management Information Systems The foundation of Coachs information systems is its Enterprise Resource Planning system. This fully integrated system supports all aspects of finance and accounting, procurement, inventory control, sales and store replenishment. The system functions as a central repository for all of Coachs transactional information, resulting in increased efficiencies, improved inventory control and a better understanding of consumer demand. This system is fully scalable to accommodate rapid growth.
9 TABLE OF CONTENTS Complementing its Enterprise Resource Planning system are several other system solutions, each of which Coach believes is well suited for its needs. The data warehouse system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single platform for all management reporting. The supply chain management system supports sales and inventory planning and reporting functions. Product fulfillment is facilitated by Coachs highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system, while the unique requirements of Coachs internet and catalog businesses are supported by Coachs order management system. Finally, the point-of-sale system supports all in-store transactions, distributes management reporting to each store, and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis. This daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment. Updates and upgrades of these systems are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve our functionality. All complementary systems are integrated with the central Enterprise Resource Planning system.
Trademarks and Patents Coach owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing and distribution of all of its products, both in the U.S. and in other countries in which the products are principally sold. Coach also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which Coach products are sold. Major trademarks include Coach, Coach and lozenge design, Coach and tag design and Signature C design.
Coach is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although Coach believes that the Coach name is important for its business. In addition, several of Coachs products are covered by design patents or patent applications. Coach aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress, and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally. It also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally, as well as through its network of investigators, the Coach hotline and business partners around the world.
Coachs trademarks in the United States will remain in existence for as long as Coach continues to use and renew them. Coach has no material patents.
Seasonality Because Coach products are frequently given as gifts, Coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. However, over the past several years, we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non holiday quarters, which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations. We expect that these trends will continue.
Government Regulation Most of Coachs imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that Coach may import into the U.S. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. Coach has not been restricted by quotas in the operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of its products. In addition, Coach is subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against certain prohibited foreign practices, with respect to its product sourcing and international sales operations.
Competition The premium handbag and accessories industry is highly competitive. The Company mainly competes with European luxury brands as well as private label retailers, including some of Coachs wholesale customers. Over the last several years the category has grown rapidly, encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors. However, the Company believes that as a market leader we benefit from this increased competition as it drives consumer interest in this brand loyal category.
The Company believes that there are several factors that differentiate us from our competitors, including but not limited to: distinct newness, innovation and quality of our products, ability to meet consumers changing preferences and our superior customer service.
10 TABLE OF CONTENTS Employees As of June 30, 2007, Coach employed approximately 10,100 people, including both full and part time employees. Of these employees, approximately 3,100 and 4,900 were full time and part time employees, respectively, in the retail field in North America and Japan. Approximately 50 of Coachs employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Coach believes that its relations with its employees are good, and it has never encountered a strike or work stoppage.

Item 1A. Risk Factors You should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the Business of Coach and forward-looking information in this document. Please also see Special Note on Forward-Looking Information at the beginning of this report. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer.
The growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies.
Our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. Our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. The failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. Also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position.
Significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.
We face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. Our competitors are European luxury brands as well as private label retailers, including some of Coachs wholesale customers. There is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers. We may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability.
11 TABLE OF CONTENTS We face risks associated with operating in international markets.
We operate on a global basis, with approximately 24% of our net sales coming from operations outside the U.S. However, sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in U.S. dollars. While geographic diversity helps to reduce the Companys exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to:  changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products and result in decreased international consumer demand or increase our supply costs in those markets,  political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, and  changes in foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other government controls.
We monitor our foreign currency exposure in Japan to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through foreign currency hedging of Coach Japans U.S. dollar denominated inventory purchases. We cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements.
A downturn in the economy could affect consumer purchases of luxury items and adversely affect our business.
Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as Coach products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. A downturn in the economies in which Coach sells its products may adversely affect Coachs sales.
Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities.
As a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to:  availability of raw materials,  compliance with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations,  disruptions or delays in shipments,  loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites,  product quality issues,  political unrest, and  natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control.
While we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing sites, significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our business.
Our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products.
If Coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. In addition, because Coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers orders, it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated.
12 TABLE OF CONTENTS Our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of Coach common stock.
Because Coach products are frequently given as gifts, Coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. However, over the past several years, we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non holiday quarters, which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations. We expect that these trends will continue.
Provisions in Coachs charter and bylaws, Maryland law or its poison pill may delay or prevent an acquisition of Coach by a third party.
Coachs charter and bylaws and Maryland law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire Coach without the consent of Coachs Board of Directors. Coachs charter permits its Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that Coach has the authority to issue. In addition, Coachs Board of Directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Although Coachs Board of Directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for Coachs common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of Coachs stockholders.
On May 3, 2001 Coach declared a poison pill dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of Coachs common stock. Subject to limited exceptions, these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10% or more of Coachs common stock or announces a tender offer for 10% or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the Coach Board of Directors. In this event, each right would entitle the holder of each share of Coachs common stock to buy one additional common share of Coach stock at an exercise price far below the then-current market price. Subject to certain exceptions, Coachs Board of Directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at $0.0001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that, or the date on which a majority of Coachs Board of Directors becomes aware that, a person has acquired 10% or more of the outstanding common stock. As of the end of fiscal 2007, there were no shareholders whose common stock holdings exceeded the 10% threshold established by the rights plan.
Coachs bylaws can only be amended by Coachs Board of Directors. Coachs bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to Coachs Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by Coachs Board of Directors or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of Coachs bylaws. Also, under Maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of equity securities, between Coach and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of Coachs common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a five-year period unless exempted in accordance with the statute. After this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by Coachs Board of Directors. Coachs Board has exempted any business combination with us or any of our affiliates from the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements.

13 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 2. Properties The following table sets forth the location, use and size of Coachs distribution, corporate and product development facilities as of June 30, 2007, substantially all of which are leased. The leases expire at various times through 2015, subject to renewal options.
Location Use Approximate Square Footage Jacksonville, Florida Distribution and consumer service 560,000 New York, New York Corporate, sourcing and product development 275,000 Carlstadt, New Jersey Corporate and product development 55,000 Tokyo, Japan Coach Japan, corporate 20,000 Shenzhen, Peoples Republic of China Sourcing, quality control and product development 18,000 Florence, Italy Sourcing and product development 16,000 Dongguan, Peoples Republic of China Sourcing, quality control and product development 6,000 Hong Kong Sourcing and quality control 5,000 Seoul, South Korea Sourcing 3,000 As of June 30, 2007, Coach also occupied 259 retail and 93 factory leased stores located in North America and 137 department store shop-in-shops, retail stores and factory stores in Japan. These leases expire at various times through 2020. Coach considers these properties to be in generally good condition and believes that its facilities are adequate for its operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet its anticipated requirements.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings Coach is involved in various routine legal proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant incident to the ordinary course of its business, including proceedings to protect Coachs intellectual property rights, litigation instituted by persons alleged to have been injured upon premises within Coachs control and litigation with present or former employees.
As part of Coachs policing program for its intellectual property rights, from time to time, Coach files lawsuits in the U.S. and abroad alleging acts of trademark counterfeiting, trademark infringement, patent infringement, trade dress infringement, trademark dilution and/or state or foreign law claims. At any given point in time, Coach may have one or more of such actions pending. These actions often result in seizure of counterfeit merchandise and/or out of court settlements with defendants. From time to time, defendants will raise, either as affirmative defenses or as counterclaims, the invalidity or unenforceability of certain of Coachs intellectual properties.
Although Coachs litigation with present or former employees is routine and incidental to the conduct of Coachs business, as well as for any business employing significant numbers of U.S.-based employees, such litigation can result in large monetary awards when a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory and/or punitive damages for actions claiming discrimination on the basis of age, gender, race, religion, disability or other legally protected characteristic or for termination of employment that is wrongful or in violation of implied contracts.
Coach believes that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on Coachs business or consolidated financial statements.
Coach has not entered into any transactions that have been identified by the IRS as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose. Accordingly, we have not been required to pay a penalty to the IRS for failing to make disclosures required with respect to certain transactions that have been identified by the IRS as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose.
Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders None.

19 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of Coachs financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Coachs financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document.
Executive Overview Coach is a leading American marketer of fine accessories and gifts for men and women. Our product offerings include handbags, womens and mens accessories, footwear, outerwear, business cases, sunwear, watches, travel bags, jewelry and fragrance. Coach operates in two segments: Direct-to-Consumer and Indirect. The Direct-to-Consumer segment includes sales to consumers through Company-operated stores in North America and Japan, the Internet and Coach catalogs. The Indirect segment includes sales to wholesale customers in the U.S. and Asia as well as licensing revenue. As Coachs business model is based on multi-channel international distribution, our success does not depend solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic area.
In order to sustain growth within our global framework, we continue to focus on two key growth strategies: increased global distribution, with an emphasis on our direct retail distribution in North America and Japan, and improved productivity. To that end we are focused on four key initiatives:  Build market share in the rapidly growing North American womens accessories market by leveraging our leadership position as a preferred brand for both self purchase and gifts. As part of this initiative, we continue to emphasize new usage occasions, such as weekend casual and evening. We also continue to introduce more sophisticated product to heighten our cachet, especially with our higher-end customers. Lastly, we continue to enhance the level of customer service in our stores by focusing on additional opportunities to deliver excellent customer service.
Rapidly grow our North American retail store base by adding stores within existing markets, opening in new markets in the U.S. and by accelerating store openings in Canada. We plan to add about 40 retail stores in North America in each of the next several years and believe that North America can support about 500 retail stores in total, including up to 20 in Canada. In addition, we will continue to expand select, highly productive retail and factory locations.
Expand market share with the Japanese consumer, driving growth in Japan primarily by opening new retail locations and expanding existing ones. We plan to add about 1520 new locations in fiscal 2008 and believe that Japan can support about 180 locations in total. We will also continue to expand key locations.
Raise brand awareness in emerging markets to build the foundation for substantial sales in the future. Specifically, Greater China, Korea and other emerging geographies are increasing in importance as the handbag and accessories category grows in these areas. In fiscal 2008, we intend to open approximately 30 net new locations, through distributors, in Greater China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. This includes at least five more locations in major cities in mainland China, bringing the total number of locations in mainland China to at least 16.
In addition to the strategies outlined above, we continue to focus on improving our rate of profitability and delivering superior returns on investments. By leveraging expenses, our operating margin expansion will continue to outpace our sales growth, which will drive increased cash flows from operating activities.
Fiscal 2007 Highlights During fiscal 2007, an increase in sales, combined with an improvement in margins, continued to drive net income and earnings per share growth. The highlights of fiscal 2007 were:  Net income from continuing operations increased 37.2% to $636.5 million.
Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 41.3% to $1.69 per diluted share.
Net sales increased 28.4% to $2.6 billion.
Direct-to-consumer sales rose 30.5% to $2.1 billion.
20 TABLE OF CONTENTS  Comparable store sales in North America rose 22.3%, with retail stores up 16.4% and factory stores up 30.0%.
Coach Japan sales, when translated into U.S. dollars, rose 15.9% driven by expanded distribution and mid-single-digit comparable store sales. These increases in sales reflect a 2.9% decrease due to currency translation.
In North America, Coach opened 41 new retail stores and seven net new factory stores, bringing the total number of retail and factory stores to 259 and 93, respectively, at the end of fiscal 2007. We also expanded six retail stores and seven factory stores in North America.
Coach Japan opened 19 net new locations, bringing the total number of locations at the end of fiscal 2007 to 137. In addition, we expanded nine locations.
In mainland China, together with our distributors, Coach opened eight net stores.
In March 2007, the Company exited its corporate accounts business in order to better control the location and image of the brand where Coach product is sold. Through the corporate accounts business, Coach sold products primarily to distributors for gift-giving and incentive programs. The results of the corporate accounts business, previously included in the Indirect segment, have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented.
Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 The following table summarizes results of operations for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 Variance (dollars in millions, except per share data) Amount % of Net sales Amount % of Net sales Amount % Net sales $ 2,612.5 100.0 % $ 2,035.1 100.0 % $ 577.4 28.4 % Gross profit 2,023.0 77.4 1,581.6 77.7 441.4 27.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,029.6 39.4 866.9 42.6 162.7 18.8 Operating income 993.4 38.0 714.7 35.1 278.7 39.0 Interest income, net 41.3 1.6 32.6 1.6 8.7 26.5 Provision for income taxes 398.1 15.2 283.5 13.9 114.7 40.4 Income from continuing operations 636.5 24.4 463.8 22.8 172.7 37.2 Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes 27.1 1.0 30.4 1.5 (3.3 ) (10.8 ) Net income 663.7 25.4 494.3 24.3 169.4 34.3 Net income per share: Basic: Continuing operations $ 1.72 $ 1.22 $ 0.50 40.9 % Discontinued operations 0.07 0.08 (0.01 ) (8.4 ) Net income 1.80 1.30 0.49 37.9 Diluted: Continuing operations $ 1.69 $ 1.19 $ 0.49 41.3 % Discontinued operations 0.07 0.08 (0.01 ) (8.2 ) Net income 1.76 1.27 0.49 38.2 21 TABLE OF CONTENTS Net Sales The following table presents net sales by operating segment for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006: Fiscal Year Ended Net Sales Percentage of Total Net Sales June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 Rate of Increase June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 (dollars in millions) Direct-to-Consumer $ 2,101.8 $ 1,610.7 30.5 % 80.5 % 79.1 % Indirect 510.7 424.4 20.3 19.5 20.9 Total net sales $ 2,612.5 $ 2,035.1 28.4 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Direct-to-Consumer Net sales increased by 30.5%, driven by increased sales from comparable stores, new stores and expanded stores. Comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months. Coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation. Similarly, stores that are expanded by 15% or more are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening. Stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base.
In North America, comparable store sales growth, sales from new stores and sales from expanded stores accounted for approximately $233 million, $142 million and $31 million, respectively, of the net sales increase. In Japan, sales from new stores, comparable store sales growth and sales from expanded stores accounted for approximately $46 million, $20 million and $8 million, respectively, of the net sales increase. Coach Japans reported net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million as a result of foreign currency exchange. Sales growth in the Internet business accounted for the remaining sales increase. These sales increases were slightly offset by store closures and a decline in the direct marketing channel.
Indirect Net sales increased by 20.3%, driven primarily by growth in the U.S. wholesale division, which contributed increased sales of approximately $73 million, as compared to the prior year. This sales increase was partially offset by an approximately $7 million decrease in net sales in the international wholesale division, as shipments to our customers were curbed in consideration of slowing Japanese travel trends in our markets and to ensure healthy inventory levels. Licensing revenue of approximately $15 million and $9 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively, is included in Indirect sales.
Operating Income Operating income increased 39.0% to $993.4 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to $714.7 million in fiscal 2006, driven by increases in net sales and gross profit, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating margin rose to 38.0% in fiscal 2007 from 35.1% in fiscal 2006. This 290 basis point improvement is attributable to increased net sales, as discussed above, and the leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses.
The following chart illustrates our operating margin performance over the last two years: Operating Margin First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Total Year Fiscal 2007 34.1 % 42.3 % 36.2 % 37.6 % 38.0 % Fiscal 2006 31.3 % 40.8 % 32.0 % 34.3 % 35.1 % Gross profit increased 27.9% to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2006. Gross margin remained strong at 77.4% in fiscal 2007 compared to 77.7% in fiscal 2006. Gross margin was negatively impacted by channel mix, as Coach Japan grew more slowly than the business as a whole while our factory store channel grew faster, as well as the fluctuation in currency translation rates. However, these negative impacts were partially offset by gains from product mix shifts, reflecting increased penetration of higher margin collections and supply chain initiatives. Coachs gross profit is dependent upon a variety of 22 TABLE OF CONTENTS factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit to fluctuate from year to year.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses comprise four categories: (1) selling; (2) advertising, marketing and design; (3) distribution and consumer service; and (4) administrative. Selling expenses include store employee compensation, store occupancy costs, store supply costs, wholesale account administration compensation and all Coach Japan operating expenses. These expenses are affected by the number of Coach and Coach Japan operated stores open during any fiscal period and the related proportion of retail and wholesale sales. Advertising, marketing and design expenses include employee compensation, media space and production, advertising agency fees, new product design costs, public relations, market research expenses and mail order costs. Distribution and consumer service expenses include warehousing, order fulfillment, shipping and handling, customer service and bag repair costs. Administrative expenses include compensation costs for the executive, finance, human resources, legal and information systems departments, as well as consulting and software expenses. SG&A expenses increase as Coach and Coach Japan operate more stores, although an increase in the number of stores generally results in the fixed portion of SG&A expenses being spread over a larger sales base.
During fiscal 2007, SG&A expenses increased 18.8% to $1.0 billion, compared to $866.9 million in fiscal 2006, driven primarily by increased selling expenses. However, as a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 39.4% during fiscal 2007, compared to 42.6% during fiscal 2006, as we continue to leverage our expense base on higher sales.
The following table presents the components of SG&A expenses and the percentage of sales that each component represented for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006: Fiscal Year Ended SG&A Expenses Percentage of Total Net sales June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 Rate of Increase June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 (dollars in millions) (FY07 v. FY06) Selling $ 718.0 $ 576.6 24.5 % 27.5 % 28.4 % Advertising, Marketing and Design 119.8 100.6 19.1 4.6 4.9 Distribution and Consumer Service 53.2 42.2 26.1 2.0 2.1 Administrative 138.6 147.5 (6.0 ) 5.3 7.2 Total SG&A Expenses $ 1,029.6 $ 866.9 18.8 % 39.4 % 42.6 % The increase in selling expenses was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of North America stores and Coach Japan. The increase in North America store expenses is attributable to increased variable expenses related to higher sales, new stores opened during the fiscal year and the incremental expense associated with having a full year of expenses related to stores opened in the prior year. The increase in Coach Japan operating expenses was primarily driven by increased variable expenses related to higher sales and new store operating expenses. However, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased reported expenses by approximately $6.1 million. The remaining increase in selling expenses was due to increased variable expenses to support sales growth in other channels.
The increase in advertising, marketing and design costs was primarily due to increased staffing costs and design expenditures as well as increased development costs for new product categories.
Distribution and consumer service expenses increased primarily as result of higher sales volumes. However, efficiency gains at the distribution and consumer service facility, partially offset by an increase in our direct-to-consumer shipments as a percentage of total shipments, led to a decrease in distribution and consumer service expenses as a percentage of net sales.
23 TABLE OF CONTENTS The decrease in administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation expense and other employee staffing costs. However, fiscal 2006 expenses were reduced by $2.0 million due to the receipt of business interruption proceeds related to our World Trade Center location. The Company did not receive any business interruption proceeds in fiscal 2007.
Interest Income, Net Net interest income was $41.3 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $32.6 million in fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to higher returns on our investments as a result of higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 38.5% in fiscal 2007 compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily attributable to incremental income being taxed at higher rates.
Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations was $636.5 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $463.8 million in fiscal 2006. This 37.2% increase is attributable to increased net sales as well as significant operating margin improvement, as discussed above.
Income from Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations was $27.1 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $30.4 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, net sales related to the corporate accounts business were $66.5 million compared to $76.4 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease in net sales and income is attributable to the exiting of the corporate accounts business during the third quarter of fiscal 2007.
Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 The following table summarizes results of operations for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005: Fiscal Year Ended July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 Variance (dollars in millions, except per share data) Amount % of Net sales Amount % of Net sales Amount % Net sales $ 2,035.1 100.0 % $ 1,651.7 100.0 % $ 383.4 23.2 % Gross profit 1,581.6 77.7 1,267.6 76.7 314.0 24.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 866.9 42.6 731.9 44.3 135.0 18.4 Operating income 714.7 35.1 535.7 32.4 179.0 33.4 Interest income, net 32.6 1.6 15.8 1.0 16.9 107.0 Provision for income taxes 283.5 13.9 201.1 12.2 82.4 40.9 Minority interest  0.0 13.6 0.8 (13.6 ) (100.0 ) Income from continuing operations 463.8 22.8 336.6 20.4 127.2 37.8 Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes 30.4 1.5 22.0 1.3 8.5 38.6 Net income 494.3 24.3 358.6 21.7 135.7 37.8 Net income per share: Basic: Continuing operations $ 1.22 $ 0.89 $ 0.33 37.4 % Discontinued operations 0.08 0.06 0.02 38.2 Net income 1.30 0.95 0.35 37.5 Diluted: Continuing operations $ 1.19 $ 0.86 $ 0.33 38.4 % Discontinued operations 0.08 0.06 0.02 39.2 Net income 1.27 0.92 0.35 38.4 24 TABLE OF CONTENTS Net Sales The following table presents net sales by operating segment for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005: Fiscal Year Ended Net Sales Percentage of Total Net sales July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 Rate of Increase July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 (dollars in millions) Direct-to-Consumer $ 1,610.7 $ 1,307.4 23.2 % 79.1 % 79.2 % Indirect 424.4 344.3 23.3 20.9 20.8 Total net sales $ 2,035.1 $ 1,651.7 23.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Direct-to-Consumer Net sales increased 23.2%, driven by increased sales from comparable stores, new stores and expanded stores.
In North America, comparable store sales growth, sales from new stores and sales from expanded stores accounted for approximately $167 million, $72 million and $13 million, respectively, of the net sales increase. Comparable store sales in North America rose 20.7%, with retail stores up 12.3% and factory stores up 31.9%. In Japan, sales from new stores, comparable store sales growth and sales from expanded stores accounted for approximately $41 million, $32 million and $11 million, respectively, of the net sales increase. Coach Japans reported net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $35 million as a result of foreign currency exchange. Sales growth in the Internet business accounted for the remaining sales increase. These sales increases were slightly offset by store closures and a decline in the direct marketing channel.
Indirect Net sales increased 23.3%, driven by growth in the U.S. wholesale and international wholesale divisions, which contributed increased sales of approximately $45 million and $36 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year. Licensing revenue of approximately $9 million and $6 million in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively, is included in Indirect sales.
Operating Income Operating income increased 33.4% to $714.7 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to $535.7 million in fiscal 2005, driven by increases in net sales and gross profit, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses. Operating margin rose to 35.1% in fiscal 2006 from 32.4% in fiscal 2005. This 270 basis point improvement is attributable to increased net sales, as discussed above, and the leveraging of SG&A expenses.
The following chart illustrates our operating margin performance over the last two years: Operating Margin First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Total Year Fiscal 2006 31.3 % 40.8 % 32.0 % 34.3 % 35.1 % Fiscal 2005 27.8 % 38.7 % 30.9 % 29.9 % 32.4 % Gross profit increased 24.8% to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2006 as compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2005. Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 77.7% in fiscal 2006 from 76.7% in fiscal 2005, as gains from supply chain initiatives and product mix shifts, reflecting increased penetration of higher margin collections, more than offset the impact of channel mix.
SG&A expenses increased 18.4% to $866.9 million in fiscal 2006 from $731.9 million in fiscal 2005, driven primarily by increased selling expenses. However, as a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 42.6% as compared to 44.3% during fiscal 2005, as we continue to leverage our expense base on higher sales.
25 TABLE OF CONTENTS The following table presents the components of SG&A expenses and the percentage of net sales that each component represented for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005: Fiscal Year Ended SG&A Expenses Percentage of Total Net sales July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 Rate of Increase July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 (dollars in millions) (FY06 v.

The increase in North America store expenses is attributable to increased variable expenses related to higher sales, new stores opened during the fiscal year and the incremental expense associated with having a full year of expenses related to stores opened in the prior year. The increase in Coach Japan operating expenses was primarily driven by increased variable expenses related to higher sales and new store operating expenses. However, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased reported expenses by approximately $16 million. The remaining increase in selling expenses was due to increased variable expenses to support sales growth in other channels.
The increase in advertising, marketing and design costs was primarily due to increased staffing costs and increased design expenditures as well as increased development costs for new product categories.
Distribution and consumer service expenses increased primarily as a result of higher sales volumes. However, efficiency gains at the distribution and consumer service facility resulted in an improvement in these expenses as a percentage of net sales.
The increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to increased share-based compensation costs and other employee staffing costs. Fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 expenses were reduced by $2.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively, due to the receipt of business interruption proceeds related to our World Trade Center location.
Interest Income, Net Net interest income was $32.6 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to $15.8 million in fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to higher returns on investments as a result of higher interest rates.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate increased to 37.9% as compared to 36.5% in fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to the non-recurrence of a one time benefit that the Company recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, related to the Companys buyout of Sumitomos 50% interest in Coach Japan.
Minority Interest Minority interest expense, net of tax, was $0 in fiscal 2006 compared to $13.6 million, or 0.8% of net sales, in fiscal 2005. The purchase of Sumitomos 50% interest in Coach Japan on July 1, 2005 eliminated minority interest as of the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations was $463.8 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $336.6 million in fiscal 2005. This 37.8% increase is attributable to increased net sales as well as significant operating margin improvement, as discussed above.
26 TABLE OF CONTENTS Income from Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations was $30.4 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $22.0 million in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, net sales related to the corporate accounts business were $76.4 million compared to $58.7 million in fiscal 2005. The Company exited the corporate accounts business during the third quarter of fiscal 2007.
Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash provided by operating activities was $779.1 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $596.6 million in fiscal 2006. The $182.5 million increase was primarily due to increased earnings of $169.4 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating fluctuations.
Net cash used in investing activities was $375.9 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $181.0 million in fiscal 2006. The $194.9 million increase in net cash used is attributable to a $187.9 million increase in the net purchases of investments and a $7.0 million increase in capital expenditures, related primarily to new and renovated retail stores in North America and Japan. Coachs future capital expenditures will depend on the timing and rate of expansion of our businesses, new store openings, store renovations and international expansion opportunities.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $10.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared to a $426.8 million use of cash in fiscal 2006. The change of $437.2 million primarily resulted from a $450.3 million decrease in funds expended to repurchase common stock in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. In addition, there was a $25.6 million increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and a non-recurrence of $12.3 million in repayments on the Japanese credit facility in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a $34.2 million decrease in excess tax benefit from share-based compensation and a $16.7 million decrease related to an adjustment to reverse a portion of the excess tax benefit previously recognized from share-based compensation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.
Revolving Credit Facilities As of the end of fiscal 2007, the Company maintained a $100 million unsecured revolving credit facility with certain lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as primary lender and administrative agent (the Bank of America facility). At Coachs request, the Bank of America facility was able to be expanded to $125 million. Coach paid a commitment fee of 10 to 25 basis points on any unused amounts of the Bank of America facility and interest of LIBOR plus 45 to 100 basis points on any outstanding borrowings. The initial commitment fee was 15 basis points and the initial LIBOR margin was 62.5 basis points. At June 30, 2007, the commitment fee was 10 basis points and the LIBOR margin was 45 basis points, reflecting an improvement in our fixed-charge coverage ratio. The facility was scheduled to expire on October 16, 2007.
On July 26, 2007 (subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007), the Company renewed the Bank of America facility, extending the facility expiration to July 26, 2012. At Coachs request, the renewed Bank of America facility can be expanded to $200 million. The facility can also be extended for two additional one-year periods, at Coachs request. Under the renewed Bank of America facility, Coach will pay a commitment fee of 6 to 12.5 basis points on any unused amounts and interest of LIBOR plus 20 to 55 basis points on any outstanding borrowings.
The Bank of America facility is available for seasonal working capital requirements or general corporate purposes and may be prepaid without penalty or premium. During fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 there were no borrowings under the Bank of America facility. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Bank of America facility.
The Bank of America facility contains various covenants and customary events of default. Coach has been in compliance with all covenants since its inception.
To provide funding for working capital and general corporate purposes, Coach Japan has available credit facilities with several Japanese financial institutions. These facilities allow a maximum borrowing of 7.4 billion yen, or approximately $60 million, at June 30, 2007. Interest is based on the Tokyo Interbank rate plus a margin of up to 50 basis points.
27 TABLE OF CONTENTS During fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, the peak borrowings under the Japanese credit facilities were $25.5 million and $21.6 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Japanese credit facilities.
Common Stock Repurchase Program On October 20, 2006, the Coach Board of Directors approved an additional common stock repurchase program to acquire up to $500 million of Coachs outstanding common stock. This authorization expires in June 2008. In connection with Coachs stock repurchase program, purchases of Coach stock may be made from time to time, subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices, through open market purchases. Repurchased shares of common stock become authorized but unissued shares and may be issued in the future for general corporate and other purposes. The Company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time.
During fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased and retired 5.0 million and 19.1 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $29.99 and $31.50 per share, respectively. As of June 30, 2007, $500 million remained available for future repurchases under the existing program.
Liquidity and Capital Resources In fiscal 2007, total capital expenditures were $140.9 million. In North America, Coach opened 41 new retail and seven net new factory stores and expanded six retail stores and seven factory stores. These new and expanded stores accounted for approximately $70 million of the total capital expenditures. In addition, spending on department store renovations and distributor locations accounted for approximately $9 million of the total capital expenditures. In Japan, we invested approximately $17 million, primarily for the opening of 19 net new locations and nine store expansions. The remaining capital expenditures related to corporate systems and infrastructure. These investments were financed from on hand cash, operating cash flows and by using funds from our Japanese revolving credit facilities.
For the fiscal year ending June 28, 2008, the Company expects total capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million. Capital expenditures will be primarily for new stores and expansions both in the U.S. and in Japan. We expect to open approximately 40 new North American retail stores, six new factory stores and 15-20 new locations in Japan, while continuing to invest in department store and distributor locations. In addition, we will invest in corporate infrastructure and expand our Jacksonville distribution center. These investments will be financed primarily from on hand cash and operating cash flows.
Coach experiences significant seasonal variations in its working capital requirements. During the first fiscal quarter Coach builds inventory for the holiday selling season, opens new retail stores and generates higher levels of trade receivables. In the second fiscal quarter its working capital requirements are reduced substantially as Coach generates consumer sales and collects wholesale accounts receivable. In fiscal 2007, Coach purchased approximately $663 million of inventory, which was funded by on hand cash, operating cash flow and by borrowings under the Japanese revolving credit facilities.
Management believes that cash flow from continuing operations and on hand cash will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and the common stock repurchase program. Any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital. There can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to Coach on acceptable terms or at all. Coachs ability to fund its working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments, as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements, depends on its future operating performance and cash flow, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond Coachs control.
Commitments At June 30, 2007, the Company had letters of credit available of $205 million, of which $115.6 million were outstanding. These letters of credit, which expire at various dates through 2012, primarily collateralize the Companys obligation to third parties for the purchase of inventory. In addition, $13.2 million relates to a letter of credit for the benefit of the Sara Lee Corporation (Sara Lee). Prior to Coachs spin off from Sara Lee, Sara Lee was a guarantor or a party to many of Coachs leases. Coach has agreed to make efforts to 28 TABLE OF CONTENTS remove Sara Lee from all of its existing leases, and Sara Lee is not a guarantor or a party to any new or renewed leases. Coach has obtained a letter of credit for the benefit of Sara Lee in an amount approximately equal to the annual minimum rental payments under leases transferred to Coach by Sara Lee, but for which Sara Lee retains contingent liability. Coach is required to maintain this letter of credit until the annual minimum rental payments under the relevant leases are less than $2.0 million. The initial letter of credit had a face amount of $20.6 million, and we expect this amount to decrease annually as Coachs guaranteed obligations are reduced. Coach expects that it will be required to maintain the letter of credit for approximately 10 years.
Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2007, Coachs long-term contractual obligations are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 13 Years 35 Years More than 5 Years (amounts in millions) Capital expenditure commitments (1) $ 2.5 $ 2.5 $  $  $  Inventory purchase obligations (2) 134.7 134.7    Long-term debt, including the current portion 3.1 0.2 0.6 0.8 1.5 Operating leases 683.8 89.0 175.8 162.5 256.5 Total $ 824.1 $ 226.4 $ 176.4 $ 163.3 $ 258.0 (1) Represents the Companys legally binding agreements related to capital expenditures.
(2) Represents the Companys legally binding agreements to purchase finished goods.
The table above excludes the following: amounts included in current liabilities, other than the current portion of long-term debt, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2007 as these items will be paid within one year; long-term liabilities not requiring cash payments, such as deferred lease incentives; and cash contributions for the Companys pension plans. The Company intends to contribute approximately $0.6 million to its pension plans during the next year.
Coach does not have any off-balance-sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Coachs risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for trading purposes. The valuation of financial instruments that are marked-to-market are based upon independent third-party sources.
Long-Term Debt Coach is party to an Industrial Revenue Bond related to its Jacksonville, Florida distribution and consumer service facility. This loan has a remaining balance of $3.1 million and bears interest at 4.5%. Principal and interest payments are made semiannually, with the final payment due in 2014.
Seasonality Because its products are frequently given as gifts, Coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. However, over the past several years, we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non-holiday quarters, which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations. We expect these trends to continue.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. The development and selection of the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
29 TABLE OF CONTENTS The accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements. For more information on Coachs accounting policies, please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inventories The Companys inventories are reported at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs include material, conversion costs, freight and duties and are determined by the first-in, first-out method, except for inventories of Coach Japan, for which cost is determined by the last-in, first-out method. The Company reserves for slow-moving and aged inventory based on historical experience, current product demand and expected future demand. A decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes, buying patterns or increased competition could impact Coachs evaluation of its slow-moving and aged inventory and additional reserves might be required. At June 30, 2007, a 10% change in the reserve for slow-moving and aged inventory would have resulted in an insignificant change in inventory and cost of goods sold.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company evaluates goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment. In order to complete our impairment analysis, we must perform a valuation analysis which includes determining the fair value of the Companys reporting units based on discounted cash flows. This analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and estimate the profitability of future growth strategies. The Company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005.
Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment annually to determine if the carrying value of the assets is recoverable. The evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related business. An impairment loss is recognized if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. The Company did not record any impairment losses in fiscal 2007, 2006, or 2005. However, as the determination of future cash flows is based on expected future performance, impairment could result in the future if expectations are not met.
Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized at the point of sale, which occurs when merchandise is sold in an over-the-counter consumer transaction or, for the wholesale, Internet and catalog channels, upon shipment of merchandise, when title passes to the customer. Revenue associated with gift cards is recognized upon redemption. The Company estimates the amount of gift cards that will not be redeemed and records such amounts as revenue over the period of the performance obligation. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts and returns are provided when sales are recorded based upon historical experience and current trends. Royalty revenues are earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the Coach brand. Revenue earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported sales from the licensee. At June 30, 2007, a 10% change in the allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts and returns would have resulted in an insignificant change in accounts receivable and net sales.
Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The grant-date fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and involves several assumptions, including the expected term of the option and expected volatility. The expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Companys stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on Coachs stock. Changes in the assumptions used to determine the Black-Scholes value could result in significant changes in the Black-Scholes value. A 10% change in the Black-Scholes value would result in an insignificant change in FY07 share-based compensation expense.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instrumentsan amendment of FASB Statements 133 and 140. SFAS 155 permits fair value measurement for any hybrid financial 30 TABLE OF CONTENTS instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. This statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after July 1, 2007. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 06-3, How Taxes Collected From Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That is, Gross versus Net Presentation). EITF 06-3 requires disclosure of a companys accounting policy with respect to presentation of taxes collected on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer. For taxes that are reported on a gross basis (included in revenues and costs), EITF 06-3 also requires disclosure of the amount of taxes included in the financial statements. EITF 06-3 was effective for the interim reporting period that began on December 31, 2006. As the Company did not modify its accounting policy of recording sales taxes collected on a net basis, the adoption of EITF 06-3 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement is effective for the fiscal year beginning June 29, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation, in its statement of financial position. SFAS 158 also requires an employer to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end statement of financial position. This statement is effective as of the end of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, except for the requirement to measure plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end statement of financial position, which is effective for the fiscal year ending June 27, 2009. The impact of adopting SFAS 158 is described in Note 12.
In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB 108 states that SEC registrants should use both a balance sheet approach and an income statement approach when quantifying and evaluating the materiality of a misstatement, contains guidance on correcting errors under the dual approach and provides transition guidance for correcting errors existing in prior years. SAB 108 is effective for annual financial statements covering the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This statement is effective for the fiscal year beginning June 29, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. Coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of 31 TABLE OF CONTENTS derivative financial instruments with respect to Coach Japan. The use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with Coachs risk management policies. Coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes.
The following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. These quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency Exchange Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into U.S. dollars.
Substantially all of Coachs fiscal 2007 non-licensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the United States. These countries include China, India, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Mauritius, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan and Turkey. Additionally, sales are made through international channels to third party distributors. Substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding Coach Japan, are denominated in U.S. dollars and, therefore, are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk.
In Japan, Coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as a result of Coach Japans U.S. dollar denominated inventory purchases. Coach Japan enters into certain foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily zero-cost collar options, to manage these risks. The foreign currency contracts entered into by the Company have durations no greater than 12 months. As of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of $111.1 million and $114.8 million, respectively, were outstanding.
Coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to Coach Japan as a result of its $231 million U.S. dollar denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from Coach. To manage this risk, on July 1, 2005, Coach Japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction, the terms of which include an exchange of a U.S. dollar fixed interest rate for a yen fixed interest rate. The loan matures in 2010, at which point the swap requires an exchange of yen and U.S. dollar based principals.
The fair values of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006 were $23.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively. The fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in yen exchange rates.
Coach believes that exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and expenses of foreign operations, which are denominated in Japanese Yen and Canadian Dollars, are not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Interest Rate Coach is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its investments, revolving credit facilities and long-term debt.
The Companys investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the Companys investment policy, which identifies allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. We do not hold any investments for trading purposes. The Companys investment portfolio consists of U.S. government and agency securities as well as municipal government and corporate debt securities. As the Company has both the ability and intent to hold these securities until maturity, investments are classified as held-to-maturity and stated at amortized cost, except for auction rate securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. At June 30, 2007, the Companys short term investments consisted of $628.9 million of auction rate securities. As auction rate securities market price equals its fair value, there are no unrealized gains or losses associated with these investments.
32 TABLE OF CONTENTS As of June 30, 2007, the Company did not have any outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facilities and the Company does not expect to borrow against the facilities in the foreseeable future. However, the fair value of any outstanding borrowings in the future may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
As of June 30, 2007, Coachs outstanding long-term debt, including the current portion, was $3.1 million. A hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of Coach.

36 TABLE OF CONTENTS REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coach, Inc.
New York, New York We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coach, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2007. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 23, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP New York, New York August 23, 2007 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coach, Inc.
New York, New York We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Coach, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended June 30, 2007 of the Company and our report dated August 23, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 1. Nature of Operations Coach, Inc. (the Company) designs and markets high-quality, modern American classic accessories. The Companys primary product offerings, manufactured by third-party suppliers, include handbags, womens and mens accessories, footwear, outerwear, business cases, sunwear, watches, travel bags, jewelry and fragrance. Coachs products are sold through its Direct-to-Consumer segment, which includes Company-operated stores in North America and Japan, its online store and its catalogs, as well as through its Indirect segment, which includes department store locations in the United States, international department stores, freestanding retail locations and specialty retailers.
2. Significant Accounting Policies Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to June 30. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in the financial statements relate to fiscal years. The fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 (fiscal 2007), July 1, 2006 (fiscal 2006) and July 2, 2005 (fiscal 2005) were each 52-week periods.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries under the control of the Company, including Coach Japan, Inc. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash balances and highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than 90 days at the date of purchase.
Investments Investments consist of U.S. government and agency debt securities as well as municipal government and corporate debt securities. These securities are classified as held-to-maturity, as the Company has both the ability and the intent to hold these securities until maturity, except for auction rate securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Investments classified as held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost. Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted over the lives of the related securities as adjustments to interest income. Investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose Coach to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash investments and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash investments with high-credit quality financial institutions and currently invests primarily in U.S. government and agency debt securities, municipal government and corporate debt securities, and bank money market funds placed with major banks and financial institutions. Accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising Coachs customer base and their dispersion across many geographical regions. The Company believes no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these cash investments and accounts receivable.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Inventories Inventories consist primarily of finished goods. U.S. inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined by the first-in, first-out method (FIFO)) or market. Inventories in Japan are valued at the lower of cost (determined by the last-in, first-out method (LIFO)) or market. At the end of fiscal 2007, inventories recorded at LIFO were $3,251 higher than if they were valued at FIFO. At the end of fiscal 2006, inventories recorded at LIFO were $911 lower than if they were valued at FIFO. Inventories valued under LIFO amounted to $49,301 and $54,651 in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Inventory costs include material, conversion costs, freight and duties.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over lives of five to seven years and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over lives of three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease terms. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to earnings as incurred while expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Upon the disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts.
Operating Leases The Companys leases for office space, retail stores and the distribution facility are accounted for as operating leases. The majority of the Companys lease agreements provide for tenant improvement allowances, rent escalation clauses and/or contingent rent provisions. Tenant improvement allowances are recorded as a deferred lease credit on the balance sheet and amortized over the lease term, which is consistent with the amortization period for the constructed assets. Rent expense is recorded when the Company takes possession of a store to begin its buildout, which generally occurs before the stated commencement of the lease term and is approximately 60 to 90 days prior to the opening of the store.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company performed an impairment evaluation in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 and concluded that there was no impairment of its goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment annually to determine if the carrying value of the assets is recoverable. The evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related business. An impairment loss is recognized if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. The Company performed an impairment evaluation in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 and concluded that there was no impairment of its long-lived assets.
Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized at the point of sale, which occurs when merchandise is sold in an over-the-counter consumer transaction or, for the wholesale, Internet and catalog channels, upon shipment of merchandise, when title passes to the customer. Revenue associated with gift cards is recognized upon redemption. The Company estimates the amount of gift cards that will not be redeemed and records such amounts as revenue over the period of the performance obligation. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts and returns are provided when sales are recorded. Royalty revenues are earned through license agreements with 44 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the Coach brand. Revenue earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported sales from the licensee. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on a net basis and therefore excluded from revenue.
Advertising Advertising costs include expenses related to direct marketing activities, such as catalogs, as well as media and production costs. In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, advertising expenses totaled $47,287, $35,887 and $39,038, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs are expensed when the advertising first appears.
Share-Based Compensation The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The grant-date fair value of the award is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period.
Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred were $28,142, $19,927 and $16,188 in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS 109, a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their respective tax bases. Coach does not provide for U.S. income taxes on the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as the Company intends to permanently reinvest these earnings.
Minority Interest in Subsidiary Minority interest in the statements of income represents Sumitomo Corporations share of the earnings in Coach Japan prior to the July 1, 2005 purchase of Sumitomos 50% interest in Coach Japan.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company has evaluated its Industrial Revenue Bond and believes, based on the interest rate, related term and maturity, that the fair value of such instrument approximates its carrying amount. As of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, investments, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximated their values due to the short-term maturities of these accounts. See Note 6, Investments, for the fair values of the Companys investments as of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006.
Coach Japan enters into foreign currency contracts that hedge certain U.S. dollar denominated inventory purchases and its fixed rate intercompany loan. These contracts qualify for hedge accounting and have been designated as cash flow hedges. The fair value of these contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings in the period in which the hedged item is also recognized in earnings. The fair value of the foreign currency derivative is based on its market value as determined by an independent party. However, considerable judgment is required in developing estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that Coach could settle in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or methodologies could affect the estimated fair value.
45 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Foreign Currency The functional currency of the Companys foreign operations is the applicable local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders equity.
Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is calculated similarly but includes potential dilution from the exercise of stock options and stock awards.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instrumentsan amendment of FASB Statements 133 and 140. SFAS 155 permits fair value measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. This statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after July 1, 2007. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 06-3, How Taxes Collected From Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That is, Gross versus Net Presentation). EITF 06-3 requires disclosure of a companys accounting policy with respect to presentation of taxes collected on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer. For taxes that are reported on a gross basis (included in revenues and costs), EITF 06-3 also requires disclosure of the amount of taxes included in the financial statements. EITF 06-3 was effective for the interim reporting period that began on December 31, 2006. As the Company did not modify its accounting policy of recording sales taxes collected on a net basis, the adoption of EITF 06-3 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement is effective for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2007. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation, in its statement of financial position. SFAS 158 also requires an employer to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end statement of financial position. This statement is effective as of the end of the 46 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, except for the requirement to measure plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end statement of financial position, which is effective for the fiscal year ending June 27, 2009. The impact of adopting SFAS 158 is described in Note 12.
In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB 108 states that SEC registrants should use both a balance sheet approach and an income statement approach when quantifying and evaluating the materiality of a misstatement, contains guidance on correcting errors under the dual approach and provides transition guidance for correcting errors existing in prior years. SAB 108 is effective for annual financial statements covering the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This statement is effective for the fiscal year beginning June 29, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
3. Discontinued Operations In March 2007, the Company exited its corporate accounts business in order to better control the location and image of the brand where Coach product is sold. Through the corporate accounts business, Coach sold products primarily to distributors for gift-giving and incentive programs. The results of the corporate accounts business, previously included in the Indirect segment, have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. As the Company uses a centralized approach to cash management, interest income was not allocated to the corporate accounts business. The following table summarizes results of the corporate accounts business: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 Net sales $ 66,463 $ 76,416 $ 58,719 Income before provision for income taxes 44,483 49,897 36,903 Income from discontinued operations 27,136 30,437 21,965 The consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2007 includes approximately $71 of accounts receivable, net and approximately $2,254 of accrued liabilities, related to the corporate accounts business. The net book value of the fixed assets related to the corporate accounts business was $0 prior to the exiting of the business. Accordingly, no gain or loss was recognized upon disposal of the fixed assets. The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes the corporate accounts business for all periods presented.
47 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 4. Share-Based Compensation The Company maintains several share-based compensation plans which are more fully described below. The following table shows the total compensation cost charged against income for these plans and the related tax benefits recognized in the income statement: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 Share-based compensation expense $ 56,726 $ 69,190 $ 55,880 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense 22,071 27,191 21,793 The above amounts include $486, $1,290 and $797 of share-based compensation expense and $187, $503 and $311 of related income tax benefit related to discontinued operations in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Coach Stock-Based Plans Coach maintains the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2000 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan to award stock options, shares and other forms of equity compensation to certain members of Coach management and the outside members of its Board of Directors. These plans were approved by Coachs stockholders. The exercise price of each stock option equals the market price of Coachs stock on the date of grant and generally has a maximum term of 10 years. Options generally vest ratably over three years. Share awards are restricted and subject to forfeiture until the retention period is completed. The retention period is generally three years.
For options granted under Coachs stock option plans prior to July 1, 2003, an active employee can receive a replacement stock option equal to the number of shares surrendered upon a stock-for-stock exercise. The exercise price of the replacement option equals 100% of the market value at the date of exercise of the original option and will remain exercisable for the remaining term of the original option. Replacement stock options generally vest six months from the grant date. Replacement stock options of 1,462, 5,378 and 7,029 were granted in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Companys stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on Coachs stock. The risk free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury issue as of the date of the grant. As Coach does not pay dividends, the dividend yield is 0%.
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $7.12, $8.49 and $3.10, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $191,950, $232,507 and $201,232, respectively. The total cash received from these option exercises was $112,119, $86,550 and $46,835 in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and the actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from these option exercises was $69,496, $88,534 and $78,480, respectively.
At June 30, 2007, $77,948 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 4. Share-Based Compensation (continued) Share Awards The grant-date fair value of each Coach share award is equal to the fair value of Coach stock at the grant date. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of shares granted during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $35.09, $34.17 and $22.96, respectively. The following table summarizes information about nonvested shares as of and for the year ended June 30, 2007: Number of Non-Vested Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Nonvested at July 1, 2006 1,329 $ 22.06 Granted 332 35.09 Vested (294 ) 17.30 Forfeited (41 ) 30.62 Nonvested at June 30, 2007 1,326 $ 26.10 The total fair value of shares vested during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $11,558, $28,932 and $5,829, respectively. At June 30, 2007, $15,387 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.
The Company recorded an adjustment in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 to reduce additional paid-in-capital by $16,658, with a corresponding increase to current liabilities, due to an excess tax benefit from share-based compensation overstatement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. This immaterial adjustment is reflected within the cash flows from financing activities of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, full-time Coach employees are permitted to purchase a limited number of Coach common shares at 85% of market value. Under this plan, Coach sold 159, 162 and 159 shares to employees in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Compensation expense is calculated for the fair value of employees purchase rights using the Black-Scholes model and the following weighted-average assumptions: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 Expected term (years) 0.5 0.5 0.5 Expected volatility 30.1 % 25.7 % 27.6 % Risk-free interest rate 5.1 % 3.7 % 2.8 % Dividend yield % % % The weighted-average fair value of the purchase rights granted during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $8.72, $6.64 and $6.24, respectively.
Deferred Compensation Under the Coach, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, executive officers and certain employees at or above the senior director level may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual bonus or annual base salary into the plan. Under the Coach, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, Coachs outside directors may similarly defer their directors fees. Amounts deferred under these plans may, at the participants election, be either represented by deferred stock units, which represent the right to receive shares of Coach common stock on the distribution date elected by the participant, or placed in an interest-bearing 50 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.

Leases Coach leases certain office, distribution and retail facilities. The lease agreements, which expire at various dates through 2020, are subject, in some cases, to renewal options and provide for the payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance. Certain leases contain escalation clauses resulting from the pass-through of increases in operating costs, property taxes and the effect on costs from changes in consumer price indices. Certain rentals are also contingent upon factors such as sales.
Rent-free periods and scheduled rent increases are recorded as components of rent expense on a straight-line basis over the related terms of such leases. Contingent rentals are recognized when the achievement of the target (i.e., sales levels), which triggers the related payment, is considered probable. Rent expense for the Companys operating leases consisted of the following: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 July 2, 2005 Minimum rentals $ 83,006 $ 77,376 $ 73,283 Contingent rentals 24,452 16,380 12,101 Total rent expense $ 107,458 $ 93,756 $ 85,384 Future minimum rental payments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows: Fiscal Year Amount 2008 $ 88,966 2009 89,344 2010 86,515 2011 83,904 2012 78,582 Subsequent to 2012 256,538 Total minimum future rental payments $ 683,849 51 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 5. Leases (continued) Certain operating leases provide for renewal for periods of five to ten years at their fair rental value at the time of renewal. In the normal course of business, operating leases are generally renewed or replaced by new leases.
6. Investments The Companys investments consist of U.S. government and agency debt securities as well as municipal government and corporate debt securities. As the Company has both the ability and the intent to hold these securities until maturity, investments are classified as held-to-maturity and stated at amortized cost, except for auction rate securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. As of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, available-for-sale securities were $628,860 and $253,650. The remaining investments as of July 1, 2006 were held-to-maturity. The following table shows the amortized cost, fair value, and unrealized gains and losses of the Companys investments: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 Amortized Cost Fair Value Unrealized Loss Amortized Cost Fair Value Unrealized Loss Short-term investments: U.S. government and agency securities $ 25,000 $ 25,000 $  $ 49,986 $ 49,641 $ (345 ) Corporate debt securities 206,675 206,675  198,191 197,529 (662 ) Municipal securities 397,185 397,185  146,000 146,000  Short-term investments $ 628,860 $ 628,860 $  $ 394,177 $ 393,170 $ (1,007 ) As of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, all held-to-maturity investments had maturities of less than one year. Auction rate securities are included in short-term investments as they are intended to meet the short-term working capital needs of the Company and the Company can sell or roll them over at each 7, 28 or 35 day auction cycle.
7. Debt Revolving Credit Facilities As of the end of fiscal 2007, the Company maintained a $100,000 unsecured revolving credit facility with certain lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as primary lender and administrative agent (the Bank of America facility). At Coachs request, the Bank of America facility was able to be expanded to $125,000. Coach paid a commitment fee of 10 to 25 basis points on any unused amounts of the Bank of America facility and interest of LIBOR plus 45 to 100 basis points on any outstanding borrowings. The initial commitment fee was 15 basis points and the initial LIBOR margin was 62.5 basis points. At June 30, 2007, the commitment fee was 10 basis points and the LIBOR margin was 45 basis points, reflecting an improvement in our fixed-charge coverage ratio. The facility was scheduled to expire on October 16, 2007.
On July 26, 2007 (subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007), the Company renewed the Bank of America facility, extending the facility expiration to July 26, 2012. At Coachs request, the renewed Bank of America facility can be expanded to $200,000. The facility can also be extended for two additional one-year periods, at Coachs request. Under the renewed Bank of America facility, Coach will pay a commitment fee of 6 to 12.5 basis points on any unused amounts and interest of LIBOR plus 20 to 55 basis points on any outstanding borrowings.
52 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 7. Debt (continued) The Bank of America facility is available for seasonal working capital requirements or general corporate purposes and may be prepaid without penalty or premium. During fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 there were no borrowings under the Bank of America facility. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Bank of America facility.
The Bank of America facility contains various covenants and customary events of default. Coach has been in compliance with all covenants since its inception.
To provide funding for working capital and general corporate purposes, Coach Japan entered into credit facilities with several Japanese financial institutions. These facilities allow a maximum borrowing of 7.4 billion yen, or approximately $60,000, at June 30, 2007. Interest is based on the Tokyo Interbank rate plus a margin of up to 50 basis points.
During fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, the peak borrowings under the Japanese credit facilities were $25,518 and $21,568, respectively. As of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, outstanding borrowings under the Japanese credit facilities were $0.
Long-Term Debt Coach is party to an Industrial Revenue Bond related to its Jacksonville, Florida facility. This loan bears interest at 4.5%. Principal and interest payments are made semi-annually, with the final payment due in 2014. As of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, the remaining balance on the loan was $3,100 and $3,270, respectively. Future principal payments under the Industrial Revenue Bond are as follows: Fiscal Year Amount 2008 $ 235 2009 285 2010 335 2011 385 2012 420 Subsequent to 2012 1,440 Total $ 3,100 8. Commitments and Contingencies At June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, the Company had letters of credit available of $205,000 and $155,000, of which $115,575 and $91,855, respectively, were outstanding. Of these amounts, $13,236 and $15,057, respectively, relate to the letter of credit obtained in connection with leases transferred to the Company by the Sara Lee Corporation, for which Sara Lee retains contingent liability. Coach expects that it will be required to maintain the letter of credit for approximately 10 years. The remaining letters of credit, which expire at various dates through 2012, primarily collateralize the Companys obligation to third parties for the purchase of inventory.
Coach is a party to employment agreements with certain key executives which provide for compensation and other benefits. The agreements also provide for severance payments under certain circumstances. The Companys employment agreements with Lew Frankfort, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Reed Krakoff, President and Executive Creative Director and Keith Monda, President and Chief Operating Officer run through August 2011. The Companys employment agreements with Michael Tucci, President, North America Retail Division and Michael F. Devine, III, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer run through June 30, 2010.
53 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 8. Commitments and Contingencies (continued) In addition to the employment agreements described above, other contractual cash obligations as of June 30, 2007 included $134,690 related to inventory purchase obligations and $2,482 related to capital expenditure purchase obligations.
In the ordinary course of business, Coach is a party to several pending legal proceedings and claims. Although the outcome of such items cannot be determined with certainty, Coachs general counsel and management are of the opinion that the final outcome will not have a material effect on Coachs cash flow, results of operations or financial position.
9. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In the ordinary course of business, Coach uses derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange risk. Coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes.
Substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties are denominated in U.S. dollars, which limits the Companys exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to Coach Japan as a result of Coach Japans U.S. dollar-denominated inventory purchases. Coach Japan enters into certain foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily zero-cost collar options, to manage these risks. These transactions are in accordance with the Companys risk management policies. As of June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, $111,057 and $114,825 of foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding. These foreign currency contracts entered into by the Company have durations no greater than 12 months. The effective portion of unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized as a component of cost of sales when the related inventory is sold.
Coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to Coach Japan as a result of its $231,000 U.S. dollar denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from Coach. To manage this risk, on July 1, 2005, Coach Japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction, the terms of which include an exchange of a U.S. dollar fixed interest rate for a yen fixed interest rate. The loan matures in 2010, at which point the swap requires an exchange of yen and U.S. dollar based principals.
The fair values of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006 were $23,329 and $2,578, respectively. Hedging activity affected accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as follows: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 July 1, 2006 Balance at beginning of period $ (3,547 ) $ 941 Gains, net transferred to earnings (2,724 ) (3,543 ) Change in fair value, net of tax expense 7,432 (945 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,161 $ (3,547 ) The Company expects that $4,637 of net derivative gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at June 30, 2007 will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. This amount will vary due to fluctuations in the yen exchange rate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 11. Income Taxes (continued) Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes, and there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. It is the Companys policy to establish provisions for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. The Company establishes the provisions based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences and tax credits. The provisions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments to those provisions.
12. Retirement Plans Defined Contribution Plan Coach maintains the Coach, Inc. Savings and Profit Sharing Plan, which is a defined contribution plan. Employees who meet certain eligibility requirements and are not part of a collective bargaining agreement may participate in this program. The annual expense incurred by Coach for this defined contribution plan was $9,365, $7,714 and $8,621 in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Defined Benefit Plans Coach sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit plan, The Coach, Inc. Supplemental Pension Plan, (the U.S. Plan) for individuals who are part of collective bargaining arrangements in the U.S. The U.S. Plan provides benefits based on years of service. Coach Japan sponsors a defined benefit plan for individuals who meet certain eligibility requirements. This plan provides benefits based on employees years of service and earnings. The Company uses a March 31 measurement date for its defined benefit retirement plans.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation, in its statement of financial position. SFAS 158 also requires an employer to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end statement of financial position. This statement is effective as of the end of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, except for the requirement to measure plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end statement of financial position, which is effective for the fiscal year ending June 27, 2009.

As the U.S. Plan provides benefits based on years of service only, the rate of compensation increase assumption was not applicable in fiscal 2005.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the portfolio. This resulted in the selection of the 6.50% assumption for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.
During fiscal 2008, approximately $257 of actuarial loss will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost.
In the Companys U.S. Plan, funds are contributed to a trust in accordance with regulatory limits. The weighted-average asset allocations of the U.S. Plan, by asset category, as of the measurement dates, are as follows: Plan Assets Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Asset Category Domestic equities 65.3 % 61.3 % International equities 4.1 6.8 Fixed income 27.3 28.5 Cash equivalents 3.3 3.4 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS COACH, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 12. Retirement Plans (continued) The goals of the investment program are to fully fund the obligation to pay retirement benefits in accordance with the Coach, Inc. Supplemental Pension Plan and to provide returns which, along with appropriate funding from Coach, maintain an asset/liability ratio that is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and assures timely payment of retirement benefits. The target allocation range of percentages for each major category of plan assets are as follows: Minimum Maximum Equity securities 30 % 70 % Fixed income 25 % 55 % Cash equivalents 5 % 25 % The equity securities category includes common stocks and co-mingled funds of approved securities. The target allocation of securities is a maximum of 5% of equity assets in any one individual common or preferred stock and a maximum of 15% in any one mutual fund.
Coach expects to contribute $448 to its U.S. Plan during the year ending June 28, 2008. Coach Japan expects to contribute $123 for benefit payments during the year ending June 28, 2008. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid: Fiscal Year Pension Benefits 2008 $ 451 2009 480 2010 548 2011 656 2012 694 20132017 3,791 13. Segment Information The Company operates its business in two reportable segments: Direct-to-Consumer and Indirect. The Companys reportable segments represent channels of distribution that offer similar merchandise, service and marketing strategies. Sales of Coach products through Company-operated stores in North America and Japan, the Internet and the Coach catalog constitute the Direct-to-Consumer segment. The Indirect segment includes sales of Coach products to other retailers and royalties earned on licensed products. In deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance, Coachs executive officers regularly evaluate the sales and operating income of these segments. Operating income is the gross margin of the segment less direct expenses of the segment. Unallocated corporate expenses include production variances, general marketing, administration and information systems, as well as distribution and consumer service expenses.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company exited its corporate accounts business. The results of the corporate accounts business, previously included in the Indirect segment, have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented.

14. Business Interruption Insurance In the fiscal year ended June 29, 2002, Coachs World Trade Center location was completely destroyed as a result of the September 11 th terrorist attack. Inventory and fixed asset loss claims were filed with the Companys insurers and these losses were fully recovered. Losses covered under the Companys business interruption insurance program were also filed with the insurers. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company reached a final settlement with its insurance carriers related to losses covered under the business interruption insurance program. Accordingly, the Company did not receive any proceeds in fiscal 2007 and does not expect to receive any additional business interruption proceeds related to the World Trade Center location in the future. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, Coach received payments of $2,025 and $2,644, respectively, under its business interruption coverage. These amounts are included as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses.

Shareholder Rights Plan On May 3, 2001, Coach declared a poison pill dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock, to the holder of each outstanding share of Coachs common stock.
Subject to limited exceptions, these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10% or more of the Companys common stock or announces a tender offer for 10% or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the Coach Board of Directors. In this event, each right would entitle the holder of each share of Coachs common stock to buy one additional common share of the Company at an exercise price far below the then-current market price. Subject to certain exceptions, Coachs Board of Directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at $0.0001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that, or the date on which a majority of Coachs Board of Directors becomes aware that, a person has acquired 10% or more of the outstanding common stock. As of the end of fiscal 2007, there were no shareholders whose common stock holdings exceeded the 10% threshold established by the rights plan.
