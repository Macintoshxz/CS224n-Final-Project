Business Company Overview CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (which may be referred to in this Form 10-K as the company, we, us and our) is the worlds largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2012 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world. We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate. As of December31, 2012, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in more than 300offices worldwide, with approximately 37,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name. Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, real estate investment management, valuation, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research. We generate revenues from management fees on a contractual and per-project basis, and from commissions on transactions. Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses, which generally involve facilities management, property management, mortgage loan servicing and investment management, represented approximately 41% of our 2012 revenue.
We generated revenue from a well-balanced, highly diversified base of clients. In 2012, our client roster included approximately 80 of the Fortune 100 companies, and consisted of firms in a broad range of industries as follows:  corporations (43%);  insurance companies and banks (14%);  pension funds and advisors (10%);  real estate investment trusts, or REITs, (7%);  individuals and partnerships (6%);  government agencies (5%); and  others (15%).
Property owners, occupiers and investors continue to consolidate their needs with fewer service providers, and are awarding their business to firms that have strong capabilities across major markets and service disciplines. We believe we are well positioned to capture a growing and disproportionate share of the business being awarded as a result of these trends.
In 2012, for the second year in a row, we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the Fortune Most Admired Companies, and were also named the Global Real Estate Advisor of the Year by Euromoney . We have been the only commercial real estate services company included in the S&P 500 since 2006, and in the Fortune 500 since 2008. Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for six consecutive years, including in 2012 when we ranked fourth overall and were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company.
3 Table of Contents CBRE History CBRE marked its 106 th year of continuous operations in 2012, tracing our origins to a company founded in San Francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake. Since then, we have grown into the largest global commercial real estate services firm (in terms of 2012 revenue) through organic growth and a series of strategic acquisitions, including the December 2006 purchase of Trammell Crow Company, which significantly deepened our outsourcing service offerings, and the 2011 acquisition of the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (ING), which bolstered our global real estate investment management business and further diversified our service offerings. The ING acquisitions included substantially all of INGs Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM) along with certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
We have also historically enhanced and complemented our global capabilities through the acquisition of regional and specialty firms that are leaders in their areas of focus, including regional firms with which we had previous affiliate relationships. These in-fill acquisitions remain an integral part of our long-term strategy.
Our Regions of Operation and Principal Services CBRE Group, Inc. is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries. CBRE Services, Inc., our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our long-term indebtedness.
We report our operations through the following segments: (1)Americas, (2)Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, (3)Asia Pacific, (4)Global Investment Management and (5)Development Services.
Information regarding revenue and operating income or loss, attributable to each of our segments, is included in Segment Operations within the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and within Note 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference. Information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is also set forth in Note 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
The Americas The Americas is our largest reporting segment, comprised of operations throughout the United States and Canada as well as key markets in Latin America. Our operations are largely wholly-owned, but also include independent affiliates, which license the use of the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis names in their local markets in return for payments of annual royalty fees to us and an agreement to cross-refer business between us and the affiliate.
Most of our operations are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE, Inc. Our mortgage loan origination, sales and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the name CBRE Capital Markets and its subsidiaries. Our operations in Canada are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Limited. Both CBRE Capital Markets and CBRE Limited are subsidiaries of CBRE, Inc.
Our Americas segment accounted for 63.0% of our 2012 revenue, 62.2% of our 2011 revenue and 62.9% of our 2010 revenue. Within our Americas segment, we organize our services into the following business areas: 4 Table of Contents Advisory Services Our advisory services businesses offer occupier/tenant and investor/owner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs, including (1)real estate services, (2)capital markets and (3)valuation. Our advisory services business line accounted for 35.0% of our 2012 consolidated worldwide revenue, 34.5% of our 2011 consolidated worldwide revenue and 35.0% of our 2010 consolidated worldwide revenue.
Within advisory services, our major service lines are the following:  Real Estate Services .
We provide strategic advice and execution to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with leasing, disposition and acquisition of property. Our many years of strong local market presence have allowed us to develop significant repeat business from existing clients, including approximately 62% of our revenues from existing U.S. real estate sales and leasing clients in 2012. This includes referrals from other parts of our business. Our real estate services professionals are particularly adept at aligning real estate strategies with client business objectives, serving as advisors as well as transaction executors. We believe we are a market leader for the provision of sales and leasing real estate services in most top U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia and Phoenix.
Our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commission-based programs, which are payable upon completion of an assignment. Therefore, as compensation is our largest expense, this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions. Due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees, we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity. We believe we invest in greater support resources than most other firms, including professional development and training, market research and information, technology, branding and marketing. We also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance.
We further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through CBRE Research& Consulting and CBRE Econometric Advisors, or CBRE-EA, our commercial real estate market information and forecasting groups.
Capital Markets.
We offer clients fully integrated investment sales and debt/equity financing services under the CBRE Capital Markets brand. The tight integration of these services fosters collaboration between our investment sales and debt/equity financing professionals, helping to meet the marketplace demand for comprehensive capital markets solutions. During 2012, we concluded more than $72.1 billion of capital markets transactions in the Americas, including $50.1 billion of investment sales transactions and $22.0 billion of mortgage loan originations and sales.
We believe our Investment Properties business, which includes office, industrial, retail, multifamily and hotel properties, is the leading investment sales property advisor in the United States, with a market share of approximately 16% in 2012. Our mortgage brokerage business originates, sells and services commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms, national banks, credit companies, insurance companies, pension funds and government agencies. In the United States, our mortgage loan origination volume in 2012 was $19.2 billion, representing an increase of approximately 16% from 2011. Approximately $8.9 billion of loans in 2012 were originated for federal government-sponsored entities, most of which were financed through revolving credit lines dedicated exclusively for this purpose. We substantially mitigate the principal risk associated with loans financed through these credit lines prior to closing by either obtaining a contractual purchase commitment from the government-sponsored entity or confirming a forward-trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a mortgage-backed security that will be secured by the loan. We advised on the sale of approximately $2.0 billion of mortgages on behalf of financial institutions in 2012, compared with $2.8 billion in 2011. In 2012, GEMSA Loan Services, a joint venture between CBRE Capital 5 Table of Contents Markets, Inc., or CBRE Capital Markets, and GE Capital Real Estate, serviced approximately $106.4 billion of mortgage loans, $66.9billion of which related to the servicing rights of CBRE Capital Markets.
Valuation . We provide valuation services that include market value appraisals, litigation support, discounted cash flow analyses and feasibility and fairness opinions. Our valuation business has developed proprietary systems for data management, analysis and valuation report preparation, which we believe provides us with an advantage over our competitors. We believe that our valuation business is one of the largest in the industry. During 2012, we completed over 40,000 valuation, appraisal and advisory assignments in the Americas.
Outsourcing Services Outsourcing commercial real estate services is a long-term trend in our industry, with corporations, institutions, public sector entities, health care providers and others seeking to achieve improved efficiency, better execution and lower costs by relying on the expertise of third-party real estate specialists. Our outsourcing services primarily include two major business lines that seek to capitalize on this trend: (1)corporate services and (2)asset services. Agreements with our corporate services clients are generally long-term arrangements and although they contain different provisions for termination, there are usually penalties for early termination. Our management agreements with our asset services clients may be terminated with notice generally ranging between 30 to 90 days; however, we have developed long-term relationships with many of these clients and we work closely with them to implement their specific goals and objectives and to preserve and expand upon these relationships. As of December31, 2012, we managed approximately 1.5 billion square feet of commercial space for property owners and occupiers in the Americas, which we believe represents one of the largest portfolios in the region. Our outsourcing services business line accounted for 28.0% of our 2012 consolidated worldwide revenue, 27.7% of our 2011 consolidated worldwide revenue and 27.9% of our 2010 consolidated worldwide revenue.
Corporate Services . We provide a comprehensive suite of services to occupiers of real estate, including portfolio and transaction management, project management, facilities management and strategic consulting. We enter into multi-year, multi-service outsourcing contracts with our clients, but also provide services on a one-off assignment or a short-term contract basis. The long-term, contractual nature of these relationships enables us to devise and execute real estate strategies that support our clients overall business strategies. Our clients include leading global corporations, health care providers and public sector entities with large, geographically-diverse real estate portfolios. Project management services are typically provided on a portfolio-wide or programmatic basis. Revenues for project management include fixed management fees, variable fees, and incentive fees if certain agreed-upon performance targets are met. Revenues may also include reimbursement of payroll and related costs for personnel providing the services. Facilities management involves the day-to-day management of client-occupied space and includes headquarter buildings, regional offices, administrative offices and manufacturing and distribution facilities. We identify best practices, implement technology solutions and leverage our resources to control clients facilities costs and enhance the workplace environment. Contracts for facilities management services are typically structured so we receive reimbursement of client-dedicated personnel costs and associated overhead expenses plus a monthly fee, and in some cases, annual incentives if agreed-upon performance targets are satisfied. In general, portfolio and transaction services contribute revenue on a transaction basis; project management and facilities management contribute contractual, or per-project, revenue and strategic consulting contributes both transaction and contractual revenue.
Asset Services . We provide property management, construction management, marketing, leasing, accounting and financial services on a contractual basis for income-producing office, industrial and retail properties owned by local, regional and institutional investors. We provide these services through an extensive network of real estate experts in major markets throughout the United States. These local office teams are supported by a strategic accounts team whose function is to help ensure quality service and to maintain and expand relationships with large institutional clients, including buyers, sellers and 6 Table of Contents landlords who need to lease, buy, sell and/or finance space. We believe our contractual relationships with these clients put us in an advantageous position to provide other services to them, including refinancing, disposition and appraisal. We typically receive monthly management fees for the asset services we provide based upon a specified percentage of the monthly rental income or rental receipts generated from the property under management, or in certain cases, the greater of such percentage fee or a minimum agreed-upon fee. We are also normally reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs, as well as certain out-of-pocket expenses, directly attributable to the properties under management.
Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Our Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, reporting segment operates in 41 countries with services primarily furnished through a number of indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. The largest operations are located in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain and the United Kingdom. Our operations in these countries generally provide a full range of services to the commercial property sector. Additionally, we provide some residential property services, focused on the prime and super-prime segments of the market, primarily in France, Spain and the United Kingdom. Within EMEA, our services are organized along the same lines as in the Americas, including brokerage, investment properties, corporate services, valuation/appraisal services, asset management services and facilities management, among others. Our EMEA segment accounted for 15.8% of our 2012 revenue, 18.2% of our 2011 revenue and 18.3% of our 2010 revenue.
In France, we believe we are a market leader in Paris and also have operations inAix en Provence, Bagnolet, Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Montreuil, Montrouge, Neuilly Sur-Seine, Saint Denis and Toulouse. Our German operations are located in Berlin, Cologne, Dsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich and Stuttgart. Our presence in Italy includes operations in Milan, Modena, Rome and Turin. Our operations in the Netherlands are located in Amsterdam, the Hague, Hoofddorp and Rotterdam. Our professionals in Russia serve clients from an office in Moscow. In Spain, we provide full-service coverage through our offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Marbella, Palma de Mallorca and Valencia. We are one of the leading commercial real estate services companies in the United Kingdom. We have held the leading market position in investment sales in the United Kingdom in each of the past five years, including in 2012. In London, we provide a broad range of commercial property real estate services to investment and corporate clients, and held the leading market position for space acquisition in 2012 for the third year in a row. We also have regional offices in Birmingham, Bristol, Jersey, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Southampton as well as offices in Aberdeen, Belfast, Edinburgh and Glasgow managed by our U.K. team.
In several countries throughout EMEA, we operate through independent affiliates that provide commercial real estate services under our brand name. Our agreements with these independent affiliates include licenses to use the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis names in the relevant territory in return for payments of annual royalty fees to us. In addition, these agreements also include business cross-referral arrangements between us and our affiliates.
Asia Pacific Our Asia Pacific reporting segment operates in 13 countries with services primarily furnished through a number of indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. We believe that we are one of only a few companies that can provide a full range of real estate services to large occupiers and investors throughout the region, similar to the broad range of services provided by our Americas and EMEA segments. Our principal operations in Asia are located in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam (a former affiliate we acquired in 2012). In addition, we have agreements with independent affiliates in Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand that generate royalty fees and support cross-referral arrangements similar to our EMEA segment. The Pacific region includes Australia and New Zealand, with principal offices located in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney, Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington. Our Asia Pacific segment accounted for 12.6% of our 2012 revenue, 13.4% of our 2011 revenue and 13.1% of our 2010 revenue.
7 Table of Contents Global Investment Management Operations in our Global Investment Management reporting segment are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Global Investors, LLC and its global affiliates, which we also refer to as CBRE Global Investors. CBRE Global Investors provides investment management services to pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments and other institutional investors seeking to generate returns and diversification through investment in real estate. It sponsors investment programs that span the risk/return spectrum across three continents: North America, Europe and Asia. In some strategies, CBRE Global Investors and its investment teams co-invest with its limited partners. Our Global Investment Management segment accounted for 7.4% of our 2012 revenue, 4.9% of our 2011 revenue and 4.2% of our 2010 revenue.
CBRE Global Investors investment programs are organized into four primary categories, which include direct real estate investments through separate accounts and sponsored equity and debt funds as well as indirect real estate investments through listed securities and multi manager funds of funds. The investment programs cover the full range of risk strategies from core/core+ to opportunistic. Operationally, dedicated investment teams execute each investment program within these categories, with the teams compensation being driven largely by the investment performance of its particular strategy/fund. This organizational structure is designed to align the interests of team members with those of the firm and its investor clients/partners and to enhance accountability and performance. Dedicated teams are supported by shared resources such as accounting, financial controls, information technology, investor services and research. CBRE Global Investors has an in-house team of research professionals who focus on investment strategy, underwriting and forecasting, based in part on market data from our advisory services group.
CBRE Global Investors closed approximately $3.9 billion and $4.2 billion of new acquisitions in 2012 and 2011, respectively. It liquidated $4.7 billion and $3.1 billion of investments in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Assets under management have increased from $11.4 billion at December31, 2002 to $92.0 billion at December31, 2012, representing an approximately 23% compound annual growth rate.
As of December31, 2012, our portfolio of consolidated real estate held for investment consisted of one industrial property and three multifamily/residential properties, all located in the United States. Included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were rental revenues (which are included in revenue) and expenses (which are included in operating, administrative and other expenses) relating to these operational real estate properties, excluding those reported as discontinued operations, of $20.2 million and $18.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2012, $32.8 million and $14.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2011 and $41.6 million and $22.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2010.
Development Services Operations in our Development Services reporting segment are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Trammell Crow Company, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries, providing development services primarily in the United States to users of and investors in commercial real estate, as well as for its own account. Trammell Crow Company pursues opportunistic, risk-mitigated development and investment in commercial real estate across a wide spectrum of property types, including industrial, office and retail properties; healthcare facilities of all types (medical office buildings, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers); and residential/mixed-use projects. Our Development Services segment accounted for 1.2% of our 2012 revenue, 1.3% of our 2011 revenue and 1.5% of our 2010 revenue.
Trammell Crow Company acts as the manager of development projects, providing services that are vital in all stages of the process, including: (i)site identification, due diligence and acquisition; (ii)evaluating project feasibility, budgeting, scheduling and cash flow analysis; (iii)procurement of approvals and permits, including zoning and other entitlements; (iv)project finance advisory services; (v)coordination of project design and engineering; (vi)construction bidding and management as well as tenant finish coordination; and (vii)project close-out and tenant move coordination.
8 Table of Contents Trammell Crow Company may pursue development and investment activity on behalf of its user and investor clients (with no ownership), in partnership with its clients (through co-investmenteither on an individual project basis or through programs with certain strategic capital partners) or for its own account (100%ownership). Development activity in which Trammell Crow Company has an ownership interest is conducted through subsidiaries that are consolidated or unconsolidated for financial reporting purposes, depending primarily on the extent and nature of our ownership interest.
As of December31, 2012, our portfolio of consolidated real estate consisted of land, industrial, office and retail properties and mixed-use projects. These projects are geographically dispersed throughout the United States. Included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were rental revenues (which are included in revenue) and expenses (which are included in operating, administrative and other expenses) relating to these operational real estate properties, excluding those reported as discontinued operations, of $35.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2012, $41.1 million and $20.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2011 and $46.9 million and $24.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2010.
At December31, 2012, Trammell Crow Company had $4.2 billion of development projects in process. Additionally, the inventory of pipeline deals (prospective projects we believe have a greater than 50% chance of closing or where land has been acquired and the projected construction start date is more than twelve months out) was $2.1 billion at December31, 2012.
Competition We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research. Each business discipline is highly competitive on an international, national, regional and local level. Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2012 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services. Depending on the geography, property type or service, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers and accounting and consulting firms. Some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do. Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive. Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are substantially smaller than us, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis. We are also subject to competition from other large multi-national firms that have similar service competencies to ours, including Cushman& Wakefield, Jones Lang LaSalle and Savills plc, as well as national firms such as Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, and large global firms with significant business lines that compete with one or more of our business lines, such as Johnson Controls, Inc.
Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which can affect an investors ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Historically, this seasonality has caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year. Earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar year-end. This has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter, with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter.
9 Table of Contents Employees At December31, 2012, excluding our independent affiliates, we had approximately 37,000 employees worldwide, approximately 44% of which are fully reimbursed by clients and are mostly in our outsourcing services lines of business. At December31, 2012, 967 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements, most of whom are on-site employees in our asset services business in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California. We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.
Intellectual Property We hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide, which include the CBRE name. Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially, adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the CBRE, CB Richard Ellis and Trammell Crow names. With respect to the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis names, we maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business. We obtained our most recent U.S.trademark registrations for the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis related marks in 2005, and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them.
We hold a license to use the Trammell Crow trade name pursuant to a license agreement with CF98, L.P., an affiliate of Crow Realty Investors, L.P., d/b/a Crow Holdings, which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement.
In addition to trade names, we have developed proprietary technologies for the provision of complex services through our global outsourcing business and for preparing and developing valuation reports for our clients through our valuation business. We also offer proprietary research to clients through our CBRE-EA research unit and we offer proprietary investment structures through CBRE Global Investors. While we seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business, we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business in the aggregate.
Environmental Matters Federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities, controls, disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that impact the ownership, management, development, use, or sale of commercial real estate. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property, including contamination resulting from above-ground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property. If contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable for such costs as a current operator of a property, regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site, including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Under certain laws and common law principles, any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property. Further, federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have begun enacting various laws, regulations, and treaties governing environmental and climate change, particularly for greenhouse gases, which seek to tax, penalize, or limit the release. Such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time.
10 Table of Contents While we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned, operated or managed by us, which may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties, we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us, and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location. However, these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties, which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general. Environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses, which could adversely impact the results of operations of these business lines.

Item1A. Risk Factors Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business.However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns, liquidity crises, fiscal uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values, property sales and leasing activities.
Many of the worlds largest economies and financial institutions continue to be impacted by ongoing global economic and financial issues, with some continuing to face financial difficulty, fiscal uncertainty, pressure on asset prices, liquidity problems and limited availability of credit, made worse in certain areas by increased unemployment or limited economic growth. It is uncertain how long these effects will last, or whether economic and financial trends in those areas, particularly in Europe, will worsen or improve. The current economic situation may be exacerbated if additional negative geo-political or economic developments, natural disasters or other disruptions were to arise.
Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, declining demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.
11 Table of Contents Our business is significantly impacted by generally prevailing economic conditions in the principal markets where we operate, which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents, which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities. Our capital markets business could also suffer from any political or economic disruption that impacts interest rates or liquidity. In addition, we could experience a reduction in the amount of fees we earn in our Global Investment Management business if our assets under management decrease or those assets fail to perform as anticipated. These economic conditions could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development.
Our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest investments alongside our investor clients. Our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets. During an economic downturn, investment capital is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated. As a result, the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability. In addition, economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business.
Performance of our asset services line of business partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage because our fees are generally based on a percentage of aggregate rent collections from these properties. The performance of these properties may be impacted by many factors which are partially or completely outside of our control, including: (i)real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally, (ii)our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during economic downturns; and (iii)the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may increase during distressed conditions.
For example, during 2008 and 2009, credit became severely constrained and prohibitively expensive and real estate market activity contracted sharply in most markets around the world as a result of the global financial crisis and the deep economic recession. These adverse macro conditions impacted commercial real estate services companies like ours by significantly hampering transaction activity and lowering real estate valuations. Similar to other commercial real estate services firms, our transaction volumes fell during 2008 and most of 2009, and as a result, our stock price declined significantly. If the economic and market conditions that prevailed in 2008 and 2009 were to return, our business performance and profitability could again deteriorate.
Most recently, in the United States, we believe that the prospect of higher capital gains taxes drove an increase in transactions in the fourth quarter of 2012, but that continued uncertainty over fiscal and tax policy has caused, and may continue to do so in 2013, our clients to delay or cancel commercial real estate transactions which may impact our revenues. The economic situation in Europe has been particularly unstable, arising from the real prospect of a default by certain nations on their debt obligations and the possibility of a Eurozone break-up. If such a default or break-up occurs, or if the measures taken to avert such a default or break-up create their own instability, the adverse impact will likely be global and significant.
Fiscal uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment, and in the global political, security and competitive landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our revenue and earnings into the future. As a result, any revenue or earnings guidance or outlook, which we have given or might give, may be overtaken by events, or may otherwise turn out to be inaccurate. Though we endeavor to give reasonable estimates of future revenue and earnings at the time we give such guidance, based on then-current conditions, there is a significant risk that such guidance or outlook will turn out to be, or to have been, incorrect.
12 Table of Contents Adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our Global Investment Management, Development Services and Capital Markets (including investment property sales and debt and equity financing services) businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity. Additionally, the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity (and pricing) in the commercial real estate market.
Disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing, disposition and acquisition of property. If our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms, there may be fewer completed leasing transactions, dispositions and acquisitions of property. In addition, if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects, our Global Investment Management and Development Services businesses will be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of co-invested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made.
In 2008 and 2009, the credit markets experienced a disruption of unprecedented magnitude. This disruption reduced the availability and significantly increased the cost of most sources of funding. In some cases, these sources were eliminated. While the credit market has improved since the second half of 2009, liquidity remains constrained and it is impossible to predict when the market will return to normalcy. This uncertainty may lead market participants to continue to act more conservatively, which may amplify decreases in demand and pricing in the markets we serve.
Our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and, in the event of a default, all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable.
Our debt instruments, including our credit agreement, impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries. These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability to:  plan for or react to market conditions;  meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans; and  finance ongoing operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest, including:  incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness;  paying dividends or making distributions on or repurchases of capital stock;  repurchasing equity interests;  the payment of dividends or other amounts to us;  transferring or selling assets, including the stock of subsidiaries;  creating liens; and  entering into sale/leaseback transactions.
Our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) to total interest expense of 2.25x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) of 3.75x. Our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios 13 Table of Contents when required. For example, we experienced a decline in EBITDA during the economic downturn in 2008 to 2009, which negatively impacted our minimum coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio. However, we significantly reduced our cost structure during 2008 and 2009, and, as a result of these cost reductions as well as renewed growth in our business, we were and continue to be well within compliance with the minimum coverage ratio and the maximum leverage ratio under our credit agreement. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest expense was 10.45x for the year ended December31, 2012 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA was 1.38x as of December31, 2012. We continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement.
A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments. If any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor. If the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated, we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt.
If we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement, the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on, and acquire control of, substantially all of our assets.
Our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries. Borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, in connection with any amendment to our credit agreement, we may need to grant additional collateral to the lenders. If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against this pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets.
Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.
We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. We established term loans totaling approximately $800.0 million under our credit agreement in 2011 to finance the REIM Acquisitions. As of December31, 2012, our total debt, excluding notes payable on real estate (which are generally nonrecourse to us) and warehouse lines of credit (which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets, and are secured by our related warehouse receivables), was approximately $2.5 billion. For the year ended December31, 2012, our interest expense was approximately $175.1 million. Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase. If we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement, our debt service obligations may be substantially increased.
Our debt could have other important consequences, which include, but are not limited to, the following:  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is used to pay principal and interest on our debt;  our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because the loans under our credit agreement generally bear interest at floating rates;  our leverage could increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions, placing us at a disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged; 14 Table of Contents  our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry;  our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, results in foreclosure on substantially all of our assets; and  our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other general corporate requirements.
From time to time, Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and Standard& Poors Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., rate our significant outstanding debt. These ratings and any downgrades thereof may impact our ability to borrow under any new agreements in the future, as well as the interest rates and other terms of any future borrowings, and could also cause a decline in the market price of our ClassA common stock in addition to our outstanding debt instruments.
We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have sufficient earnings, we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell more securities, none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which, if accomplished, may adversely impact our stock price.
We have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.
Subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants, we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities, and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of equity we invest in these activities. Subject to certain covenants in our various bank credit agreements, we are also not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt CBRE Capital Markets may incur in connection with funding loan originations for multifamily properties having prior purchase commitments by a government sponsored entity.
If we experience defaults by multiple clients or counterparties, it could adversely affect our business.
We could be adversely affected by the actions and deteriorating financial condition and results of operations of certain of our clients or counterparties if that led to losses or defaults by one or more of them, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Any of our clients may experience a downturn in their business that may weaken their results of operations and financial condition. As a result, a client may fail to make payments when due, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any client bankruptcy or insolvency, or the failure of any client to make payments when due, could result in losses to our company. A client bankruptcy would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us. Additionally, certain corporate services and property management client agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients. If such a client were to file bankruptcy or otherwise fail, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur as a result of the loss of the client.
The bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant counterparty (which may include co-brokers, lenders, insurance companies, hedging counterparties, service providers or other organizations with which we do business), or the failure of any significant counterparty to perform its contractual commitments, may result in disruption to our business or material losses to our company.
15 Table of Contents Our goodwill and other intangible assets could become further impaired, which may require us to take significant non-cash charges against earnings.
Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired. Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations, stockholders equity and our stock price. For example, due to the severe market downturn and credit crisis, we determined in December 2008 that the negative impact of the global economic slowdown and resulting decline in our stock price represented an adverse change in our business climate, requiring us to undertake an interim evaluation of our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. As a result, we incurred charges of $1.2 billion in connection with the impairment of goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets during the year ended December31, 2008. A significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the economic environment, slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period, all could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then we would record such additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees (including those acquired through acquisitions).
Our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, including Robert E. Sulentic, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr.Sulentic and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us. We also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals, who generate a significant amount of our revenues, as well as other revenue producing professionals. The departure of any of our key employees (including those acquired through acquisitions), or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers, if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer. In addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business, including brokerage and property management personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. We use equity incentives to help retain and incentivize many of our key personnel. Any significant decline in, or failure to grow, our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.
Our international operations subject us to social, political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries.
We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the United States and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally. During 2012, we generated approximately 40% of our revenue from operations outside the United States. With the REIM Acquisitions, the footprint of our Global Investment Management business significantly expanded, particularly in Europe and Asia. Additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations among diverse geographies, languages and cultures;  currency restrictions, transfer pricing regulations and adverse tax consequences, which may impact our ability to transfer capital and profits to the United States;  arbitrary adverse changes in regulatory or tax requirements;  the responsibility of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, e.g., with respect to corrupt practices, employment and licensing; 16 Table of Contents  the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability, particularly in Europe, which has seen a continuing crisis in sovereign debt, and which could be further significantly and adversely impacted if the Euro were to fail as a single currency;  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable in some geographic regions such as Asia, where many countries have underdeveloped insolvency laws;  a tendency for clients to delay payments in some European and Asian countries;  political and economic instability in certain countries; and  foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries such as China.
Although we maintain anti-corruption and anti-money laundering compliance programs throughout the company, violations of our compliance programs may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including disgorgement), and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.
We have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities, to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels. If we are unable to successfully implement these plans, maintain adequate long-term strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.
Our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations.
Our revenue from non-U.S. operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned. During 2012, approximately 40% of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies, the majority of which included the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese yuan, the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen, the Singapore dollar, the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee. Our Global Investment Management business has a significant amount of Euro-denominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe, which has seen a continuing crisis in sovereign debt resulting in a notable drop in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management, revenue and earnings.
Over time, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and the Euro relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the Euro may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
From time to time, our management uses currency hedging instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies. There can be no assurance that these hedging instruments will be available when needed. Additionally, economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates, which impact cash flow, and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position.
Our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions, which may not be available in the future or perform as expected.
A significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions, including our acquisition of the Trammell Crow Company in December 2006 and the REIM Acquisitions that we completed in the second half of 2011. Any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available 17 Table of Contents to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions. We may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our then-existing indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our then-existing debt, would increase. In addition, acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect. Future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others.
We have had, and may continue to experience, challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies. This could result in the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations. The integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems. We believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income. Acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology, accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels.
The anticipated benefits of the REIM Acquisitions may not be realized as we contemplated.
We completed the REIM Acquisitions with the expectation that such acquisitions would result in various benefits, including, among others, enhanced revenues and margins, a strengthened market position, cross-selling opportunities and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the REIM Acquisitions will be subject to a number of uncertainties, including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy, which could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.
Our revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our Global Investment Management business can vary significantly as a result of market developments.
With the completion of the REIM Acquisitions, our Global Investment Management business significantly increased and became more globally diverse.With the addition of the REIM funds, a substantial part of our fees are more recurring in nature. However, the revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our Global Investment Management business are all somewhat variable, primarily due to the fact that management, transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another.
The pace at which the real estate markets worldwide turned from positive to negative starting in 2007 and continuing into 2009 is an example of the market volatility to which we are subject and over which we have no control. The underlying market conditions, decisions regarding the acquisition and disposition of fund and separate account assets, and the specifics of client mandates will cause the amount of asset management, transaction and incentive fees to vary from one product to another.
A substantial part of our fees are based upon the value of the assets we manage and if asset values deteriorate our asset management fees will decline as a result. Our acquisition and disposition fees can decline as a result of delay in the deployment of capital or limited market liquidity. We also earn incentive fees tied to portfolio performance, which fees may decline if there is a downturn in real estate markets and we fail to meet benchmarks or absolute return hurdles.Finally, during periods of economic weakness or recession, existing and prospective clients in our Global Investment Management business may be less able or willing to commit new funds to real estate investments, which are inherently less liquid than many competing investment classes, thereby inhibiting the ability of our Global Investment Management business to raise new funds.Additionally, investors with open commitments to provide additional investment could become less able or willing to honor their financial commitments and seek to renegotiate the terms of their commitments or the fees that they are 18 Table of Contents obligated to pay.To the extent that clients in our Global Investment Management business seek to avoid paying fees they are obligated to pay, or seek to avoid deploying capital that has been committed, we could experience a decrease in collection of fees and interruptions to our client relationships and business.
Our real estate investment and co-investment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow.
An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments. As of December31, 2012, we had committed $31.7 million to fund future co-investments, $27.9 million of which is expected to be funded during 2013. In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets. The failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments, including damage to our reputation with our co-investment partners and clients, as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other co-investors. Participating as a co-investor is a very important part of our Global Investment Management business, which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments. Although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in co-investments, we may provide this capital in many instances.
Selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our Development Services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investment. As of December31, 2012, we had approximately 35 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of $11.6 million and $13.9 million of notes payable on real estate that are recourse to us (in addition to being recourse to the single-purpose entity that holds the real estate asset and is the primary obligor on the note payable). In addition, at December31, 2012, we were involved as a principal (in most cases, co-investing with our clients) in approximately 45 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of $58.9 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $14.3 million. We also guaranteed notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $2.2 million, excluding guarantees for which we have outstanding liabilities accrued on our consolidated balance sheet.
During the ordinary course of our Development Services business, we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget. While we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees (which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors), there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees. If we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Because the disposition of a single significant investment can impact our financial performance in any period, our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow. In many cases, we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss, or incentive participation fee.
Poor performance of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs.
In the event that any of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages were to perform poorly, our revenue, net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease, which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn. Moreover, we could 19 Table of Contents experience losses on co-investments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance. Investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintain our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance.
We are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and/or damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.
As a licensed real estate broker, we and our licensed employees are subject to regulatory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations. Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed. We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales, as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services, alleging that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations.
In addition, in our property management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide construction services for our managed properties. While our role is limited to that of an agent for the owner, we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions.
The advice and services we render in our financial and valuation advisory businesses and the investment decisions we make in our Global Investment Management business and the activities of our investment banking and investment management professionals for or on behalf of our clients may subject them and us to the risk of third-party litigation. Such litigation may arise from client or investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our programs, differences between actual values and appraised values, and a variety of other litigation claims, including allegations that we improperly exercised judgment, discretion, control or influence over client investments or that we breached fiduciary duties to clients. For example, in our valuation and appraisal business, if market dynamics lead to a reduction in the market value of properties we have previously appraised, we may be subject to a higher risk of claims, including conflicts of interest claims, based on the circumstances of valuations previously issued.Our valuation and appraisal services involve transactions where the value of the transaction is much greater than the fees we generate. As a result, the consequences of errors that lead to damages might be disproportionately large in relation to the fees generated in the event our contractual protections or our insurance coverage are inadequate to protect us fully.
To the extent investors in our programs suffer losses resulting from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct, investors may have remedies against us, our investment programs or funds or our employees under the federal securities law and state law. Moreover, we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors and regulators relating to allegations of our having engaged in transactions involving conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed.
Some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by the commercial insurance we maintain in amounts we believe are appropriate. However, in the event of a substantial loss, our commercial insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages, or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain types of claims. Further, the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance companys insolvency, although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly-rated companies. Any of these events could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We depend on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients across our overall business, as well as investors for our Global Investment Management business. As a result, allegations by private litigants or regulators of conflicts of interest or improper conduct by us, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us or our investment activities, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and damage our business prospects both in our Global Investment Management business and our other 20 Table of Contents global businesses. In addition, if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, it could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could materially impact our business.
A failure to appropriately deal with actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.
Our company has a global platform with different business lines and a broad client base and is therefore subject to numerous potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of services to our existing and potential clients. For example, conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions. We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, but these policies and procedures may not be adequate and may not be adhered to by our employees. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest, which could have an adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent, which could limit our market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us.
Our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which, if realized, could harm our business.
We have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other affiliations both in the United States and internationally, and we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future. In many of these joint ventures, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives. In addition, the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. If a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
We have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors, some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do.
We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research. Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2012 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services. Depending on the geography, property type or service, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, and accounting and consulting firms. Some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do. In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors, such as financial institutions. Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are substantially smaller than us, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis. We are also subject to competition from other large national and multi-national firms that have similar service competencies to ours. In general, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, to maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.
21 Table of Contents A significant portion of our operations are concentrated in California and our business could be harmed if there was an economic downturn in the California real estate markets.
During 2012, approximately 10% of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in California. As a result of the geographic concentration in California, economic downturns in the California commercial real estate market, similar to recent downturns experienced in California, and particularly in the local economies in San Diego, Los Angeles and Orange County could harm our results of operations and disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations.
We operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes. Changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could cause an adverse effect on our results.
We operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes, and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate. In addition, from time to time we engage in transactions that involve different tax jurisdictions. Due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate, we are often required to make subjective determinations.The tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law. Such disagreements could result in disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities of foreign and local jurisdictions where we carry on business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.In addition, changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter.
Our estimate of tax related assets, liabilities, recoveries and expenses incorporates assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the tax laws in various jurisdictions, the effect of tax treaties between jurisdictions, taxable income projections, and the benefits of various restructuring plans. To the extent that such assumptions differ from actual results, we may have to record additional income tax expenses and liabilities.
We are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising out of tax claims, assessments related to uncertain tax positions and provisions for specifically identified income tax exposures. There are currently tax audits ongoing in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in resolving potential tax claims that arise from these audits. We have recorded provisions on the basis of the best current understanding; however, we could be required to book additional provisions in future periods for amounts that cannot be assessed at this stage. Our failure to do so and/or the need to increase our provisions for such claims could have an adverse effect on our financial position.
If the assets in our defined benefit pension plans are not sufficient to meet the plans obligations, we may be required to make cash contributions to it and our liquidity may be adversely affected.
Our subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans. With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually, an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations. Our contributions to these plans are invested and, if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect, we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall. The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, which are incorporated herein by reference, was $63.5million and $60.9 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. If the assets in our defined benefit pension planscontinue to be insufficient to meet the plans obligations, we may be required to make substantial cash contributions preventing the use of such cash for other purposes and adversely affecting our liquidity.
If we fail to maintain and protect our intellectual property, or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be harmed and we could incur financial penalties.
Our business depends, in part, on our ability to identify and protect proprietary information and other intellectual property (such as our service marks, client lists and information, business methods and research).
22 Table of Contents Existing laws, or the application of those laws, of some countries in which we operate may offer only limited protections for our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements, and on patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. Our inability to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate or timely steps to enforce our rights may have an adverse effect on our business.
We cannot be sure that the intellectual property that we may use in the course of operating our business or the services we offer to clients do not infringe on the rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients. These claims may harm our reputation, cost us money and prevent us from offering some services.
Confidential intellectual property is increasingly stored or carried on mobile devices, such as laptop computers, which makes inadvertent disclosure more of a risk in the event the mobile devices are lost or stolen and the information has not been adequately safeguarded or encrypted.
Failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and client information could adversely affect us.
Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of client, employee or other personally identifiable data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant costs, fines, litigation or regulatory actions against us. Such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our services, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. Additionally, we increasingly rely on third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers, resulting in less direct control over our data. Such third parties may also be vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems, which could adversely affect our reputation.
Interruption or failure of our information technology, communications systems or data services could hurt our ability to effectively provide our services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.
Our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure. Our ability to conduct our global business may be adversely impacted by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure. Our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions, computer viruses, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, acts of war or terrorism, or other events which are beyond our control. In addition, the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. We have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected.
23 Table of Contents The infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients. The buildings we manage for clients, which include some of the worlds largest office properties and retail centers, are used by numerous people daily. As a result, fires, earthquakes, floods, other natural disasters, defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life, and, to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties, we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm.
Our business relies significantly on the use of commercial real estate data. We produce much of this data internally, but a significant portion is purchased from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. A disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals and/or clients could damage our reputation, and our operating results could be adversely affected.
Our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof. If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, including in our role as a real estate broker, registered investment advisor, mortgage broker, property/facility manager or developer, we may incur significant financial penalties.
We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business, as well as laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental and employment laws. Brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us to maintain applicable licenses in each U.S. state and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we perform these services. If we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses, we may be required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked. A number of our services, including the services provided by our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, CBRE Capital Markets and CBRE Global Investors, are subject to regulation by the SEC, FINRA or other self-regulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business. We could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.
As the size and scope of commercial real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased. The global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities, including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations, which we expect will continue into the future. New or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business, both within and outside of the United States, as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients. We are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
We may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate.
Various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property. In our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable as an operator for such costs. This 24 Table of Contents liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. If we fail to disclose environmental issues, we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property. If we incur any such liability, our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties, or borrow funds using such properties as collateral. In the event of a substantial liability, our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages, or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities. Additionally, liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business.

The following factors are among those, but are not only those, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements:  the sustainability of the recovery in our investment sales and leasing business from the recessionary levels in 2008 and 2009, particularly in light of the continuing European sovereign debt crisis, fiscal uncertainty in the United States, and slowing economic activity globally in 2012;  disruptions in general economic and business conditions, particularly in geographies where our business may be concentrated;  volatility and disruption of the securities, capital and credit markets, interest rate increases, the cost and availability of capital for investment in real estate, clients willingness to make real estate or long-term contractual commitments and other factors impacting the value of real estate assets, inside and outside the United States, particularly Europe, which is experiencing a sovereign debt crisis;  costs and potential future capital requirements relating to businesses we may acquire;  integration issues arising out of companies we may acquire;  continued high levels of, or increases in, unemployment and general slowdowns in commercial activity;  variations in historically customary seasonal patterns that cause our business not to perform as expected;  the impairment or weakened financial condition of certain of our clients;  client actions to restrain project spending and reduce outsourced staffing levels as well as the potential loss of clients in our outsourcing business due to consolidation or bankruptcies;  our ability to diversify our revenue model to offset cyclical economic trends in the commercial real estate industry; 25 Table of Contents  foreign currency fluctuations, particularly in Europe where the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly relative to the Euro and some local currencies since the middle of 2011, and in Japan where the Yen has recently seen significant strengthening;  our ability to attract new user and investor clients;  our ability to retain major clients and renew related contracts;  a reduction by companies in their reliance on outsourcing for their commercial real estate needs, which would impact our revenues and operating performance;  trends in pricing and risk assumption for commercial real estate services;  changes in tax laws in the United States or in other jurisdictions in which our business may be concentrated that reduce or eliminate deductions or other tax benefits we receive;  our ability to maintain our effective tax rate at or below current levels;  our ability to compete globally, or in specific geographic markets or business segments that are material to us;  our ability to manage fluctuations in net earnings and cash flow, which could result from poor performance in our investment programs, including our participation as a principal in real estate investments;  our ability to leverage our global services platform to maximize and sustain long-term cash flow;  our ability to maintain or improve our industry-leading EBITDA margins;  our exposure to liabilities in connection with real estate advisory and property management activities and our ability to procure sufficient insurance coverage on acceptable terms;  the ability of our Global Investment Management business to realize values in investment funds sufficient to offset incentive compensation expense related thereto;  liabilities under guarantees, or for construction defects, that we incur in our Development Services business;  the ability of CBRE Capital Markets to periodically amend, or replace, on satisfactory terms, the agreements for its warehouse lines of credit;  the effect of implementation of new accounting rules and standards; and  the other factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, included under the headings Risk Factors, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in our other periodic filings with the SEC.
Item1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.
26 Table of Contents Item2. Properties We occupied the following offices, excluding affiliates, as of December31, 2012: Location SalesOffices CorporateOffices Total Americas 149 2 151 Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) 93 1 94 Asia Pacific 86 1 87 Total 328 4 332 Some of our offices that contain employees of our Global Investment Management or our Development Services segments also contain employees of our other business segments. Often, the employees of these segments occupy separate suites in the same building in order to operate the businesses independently with standalone offices. We have provided above office totals by geographic region and not listed all of our Global Investment Management and Development Services offices to avoid double counting.
In general, these leased offices are fully utilized. The most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent. Our leases have terms varying in duration. The rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations. Our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs, although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases. We do not own any offices, which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own.
Item3. Legal Proceedings We are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business. Our management believes that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued arising from such lawsuits are remote, but that litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount in excess of that anticipated by management.

Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant. In addition, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends is restricted by the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facilities.

28 Table of Contents Stock Performance Graph The following graph shows our cumulative total stockholder return for the period beginning December31, 2007 and ending on December31, 2012. The graph also shows the cumulative total returns of the Standard& Poors 500 Stock Index, or S&P 500 Index, in which we are included, and an industry peer group.
The comparison below assumes $100 was invested on December31, 2007 in our ClassA common stock and in each of the indices shown and assumes that all dividends were reinvested. Our stock price performance shown in the following graph is not indicative of future stock price performance.
The industry peer group is comprised of Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL), a global commercial real estate services company publicly traded in the United States, as well as the following companies that have significant commercial real estate or real estate capital markets businesses within the United States or globally, that in each case are publicly traded in the United States or abroad: BGC Partners (BGCP), which is the publicly traded parent of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank; HFF, L.P. (HF); FirstService Corporation (FRSV), which is the publicly traded parent of Colliers International; Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI); Savills plc (SVL.L, traded on the London Stock Exchange); and UGL Limited (UGL, traded on the Australian Stock Exchange), which is the publicly traded parent of DTZ. These companies are or include divisions with business lines reasonably comparable to some or all of ours, and which represent our primary competitors. The peer group in our 2011 Form 10-K was comprised of only JLL and Grubb& Ellis Company, the latter of which was subsequently acquired by BGCP out of bankruptcy during 2012. We have revised this peer group to account for the bankruptcy of Grubb& Ellis Company, to include other competitors inside and outside the United States reflecting the increasingly global nature of the industry, and to include diversified companies that have significant commercial real estate business lines. A presentation of the 2011 peer group is not presented because, following the bankruptcy of Grubb& Ellis Company, it would only include JLL.

(1) In 2011, we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (ING). The acquisitions included substantially all of INGs Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM) along with certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia. On July 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of CRES for $332.8 million and CRES co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $58.6 million. On October 3, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Asia for $45.3 million and three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million. On October 31, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Europe for $441.5 million and one co-investment from ING for $7.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we also funded nine additional co-investments for an aggregate amount of $34.5 million related to ING REIM Europe. The results for the year ended December31, 2011 include the operations of CRES, ING REIM Asia and ING REIM Europe from July1, 2011,October3, 2011 and October31, 2011, respectively, the dates each respective business was acquired.
(2) EPS represents earnings per share. See Earnings Per Share information in Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report.
(3) Includes EBITDA related to discontinued operations of $5.6 million, $14.1 million, $16.4 million and $16.9 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2008, respectively.
EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Our management believes EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. As a result, our management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs. Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our managements discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.

33 Table of Contents Item7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are the worlds largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2012 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world. We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate. As of December31, 2012, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in more than 300 offices worldwide, with approximately 37,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name. Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, real estate investment management, valuation, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research. We generate revenue from management fees on a contractual and per-project basis, and from commissions on transactions. We have been the only commercial real estate services company in the S&P 500 since 2006, and in the Fortune 500 since 2008. In 2012, for the second year in a row, we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the Fortune Most Admired Companies, and were also named the Global Real Estate Advisor of the Year by Euromoney . Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for six consecutive years, including 2012 when we ranked fourth overall and were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company. In its most recent subscriber survey, conducted in late 2011, we achieved the highest brand reputation ranking among all commercial real estate companies in a survey of Wall Street Journal subscribers.
When you read our financial statements and the information included in this section, you should consider that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results. We believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future: Macroeconomic Conditions Economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly. These include: overall economic activity and employment growth, interest rate levels, the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies. Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines. From late 2007 through 2009, the severe global economic downturn and credit market crisis had significant adverse effects on our operations and materially reduced our revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, and reduced the funds available to invest in commercial real estate and related assets. These negative trends began to reverse in early 2010 and commercial real estate markets have improved gradually for the past three years in step with the slow recovery of global economic activity.
Weak economic conditions from late 2007 through 2009 also affected our compensation expense, which is structured to generally decrease in line with a fall in revenue. Compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business, advisory services, generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production. As a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins was partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. In addition, when negative economic conditions are particularly severe, as they were in 2008 and 2009, we have moved decisively to improve financial performance by lowering operating expenses. As general economic conditions and our financial performance improved, we restored certain expenses beginning in 2010.
34 Table of Contents Notwithstanding the ongoing, slow market recovery, a return of adverse global and regional economic trends given U.S. fiscal uncertainty, a continuing sovereign debt crisis in Europe and slower growth in China, remains one of the most significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition.
Economic conditions first began to negatively affect our performance in the Americas, our largest segment in terms of revenue, beginning in the third quarter of 2007. The effects became more severe as the decline in economic activity (particularly in the United States) accelerated throughout 2008 and most of 2009. The global capital markets disruption in late 2008, in particular, caused a significant and prolonged decline in property sales, leasing, financing and investment activity that adversely affected all our business lines. Commercial real estate fundamentals began to stabilize in early 2010 and have steadily improved for the past three years due to the slow but positive economic recovery in the United States. Reflecting this gradual recovery, national vacancy rates in the United States declined modestly and rental rates rose slightly in 2012, while the ready availability of low-cost credit and investors search for yield sustained continued increases in property sales activity. Overall, however, occupiers and investors have remained cautious and both sales and leasing activity continued to be well below the levels experienced in 2006 and 2007.
In Europe, weak market conditions first became evident in the United Kingdom in late 2007 and in countries on the continent in early 2008. The major European economies fell into recession in 2008, which deepened and persisted throughout 2009. Economic activity improved in 2010, but began to weaken again in 2011 and 2012, due to the effects of the European sovereign debt crisis. As a result, economic growth in Europe has lagged behind other parts of the world for the past two years. While rents have essentially remained flat, leasing velocity has slowed in many major markets in Europe, as occupiers hesitate to make long-term space commitments. Investment sales in Europe were adversely affected by the financial crisis in late 2008 and most of 2009. Although they recovered strongly in 2010, particularly in larger markets, investment sales have been tepid across most of Europe for the past two years. European sovereign debt issues and weak economic growth have resulted in a polarization of the investment market, with capital flowing primarily to markets perceived as safe havens, such as the United Kingdom.
Real estate markets in Asia Pacific were also affected, though generally to a lesser degree than in the United States and Europe, by the global credit market dislocation and economic downturn in 2008 and 2009. This resulted in lower investment sales and leasing activity in the region. Transaction activity revived significantly in late 2009 and remained strong throughout 2010 and most of 2011. However, transaction activity has moderated for the past 18 months, as both occupiers and investors have become more cautious, reflecting slower domestic growth and the effects of economic uncertainty in the United States and Europe on the regions export-based economies.
Real estate investment management and property development activity were also adversely affected by deteriorating conditions beginning in late 2007, driving down property values, and constraining financing and disposition opportunities. However, the macro environment for these businesses has generally improved as the real estate credit and investment sales markets have gradually recovered for the past three years.
The further recovery of our global sales, leasing, investment management and development services operations depends on the continued strengthening of market fundamentals, including more robust economic growth and job creation; stable and healthy global credit markets; and improved business and investor confidence.
Effects of Acquisitions Our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies, to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world. In December 2006, we acquired the Trammell Crow Company (the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition), our largest acquisition to date, which deepened our outsourcing services offerings for corporate and institutional clients, especially project and facilities management, strengthened our ability to provide integrated management solutions across geographies, and established resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the United States.
35 Table of Contents In 2011, we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (ING). The acquisitions included substantially all of INGs Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM) along with certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
On July 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of CRES for $332.8 million and CRES co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $58.6 million. On October 3, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Asia for $45.3 million and three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million. On October 31, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Europe for $441.5 million and one co-investment from ING for $7.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we also funded nine additional co-investments for an aggregate amount of $34.5 million related to ING REIM Europe. Upon completion of the acquisitions, which we refer to as the REIM Acquisitions, ING REIM became part of our Global Investment Management segment (which conducts business through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Global Investors, an independently operated business segment). The ING REIM businesses were highly complementary to our existing investment management business, with little overlap in client base and different investment strategies. CBRE Global Investors traditionally focused on value-add funds and separate accounts. ING REIM primarily focused on core funds and global listed real estate securities funds, except in Asia, where ING REIM managed value-add and opportunistic funds. The combined entity provides us with a significantly enhanced ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies.
As of December31, 2012, CBRE Global Investors assets under management, or AUM, totaled $92.0 billion. AUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures. Our AUM is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees. Our material assets under management consist of: a) the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing. Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our AUM. The value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost. In the case of real estate operating companies, the total value of real properties controlled by the companies, generally through joint ventures, is included in AUM; and b) the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds program.
Our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.
Strategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings. The companies we acquired have generally been quality regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region, or affiliates in which, in some cases, we held a small equity interest. From 2005 to 2010, we completed 60 in-fill acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $601 million, with most of these completed before the recession in 2008. In 2011, we completed five in-fill acquisitions, including a valuation business in Australia, a retail property management business in central and eastern Europe, our former affiliate company in Switzerland, a retail services business in the United Kingdom and a shopping center management business in the Netherlands. During 36 Table of Contents 2012, we completed five in-fill acquisitions, including our former affiliate companies in Turkey and Vietnam, a niche real estate investment advisor and an independent commercial and residential property partnership in the United Kingdom, and a brokerage and property management firm in Atlanta. As market conditions continue to improve, we believe acquisitions may once again serve as a growth engine, supplementing our organic growth.
Although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets, our management also believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income, both as a result of transaction-related expenditures, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others, and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own. For example, through December31, 2012, we incurred $258.9 million of transaction-related expenditures and integration costs in connection with the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition. In addition, through December31, 2012, we incurred $109.4 million of transaction-related expenditures and integration costs in connection with the REIM Acquisitions.
International Operations As we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the United States only at levels necessary for operating purposes. In addition, from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
Our Global Investment Management business has a significant amount of Euro-denominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe, which has seen a developing crisis in sovereign debt resulting in a more pronounced movement in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our AUM, revenue and earnings.
Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
Our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. Our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.
Leverage We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. As of December31, 2012, our total debt, excluding our notes payable on real estate (which are generally nonrecourse to us) and warehouse lines of credit (which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., or CBRE Capital Markets, and are secured by our related warehouse receivables), was approximately $2.5 billion.
Our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements place constraints on the operation of our business. Although our management believes that long-term indebtedness has been an important lever in the development of our business, including facilitating the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition and the REIM Acquisitions, the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes, which may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our 37 Table of Contents business and in the commercial real estate services industry. Our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness.
Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition In order for us to recognize revenue, there are four basic criteria that must be met:  existence of persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists;  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;  the sellers price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and  collectability is reasonably assured.
Our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria. The judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms. Each transaction is evaluated to determine: (i)at what point in time revenue is earned, (ii)whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and (iii)how and when such contingencies will be resolved. The timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made. Our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentive-based management and development fees.
We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist. Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied. Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first months rent (or a combination thereof). As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
A typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent. The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied. For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first months rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
Property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed. These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements.
Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners. Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments. These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of 38 Table of Contents the related investment management agreements. Our Global Investment Management segment also earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments. Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision. With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management team has participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest. This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period. In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts. Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
We earn development and incentive development fees in our Development Services segment. Development fees are generally based on a percentage of a defined cost measure and are recognized at the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straight-line basis over the development period. Incentive development fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met (such as specified leasing or budget targets) or, for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria, upon approval of the fee by our clients. Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost. This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost. Our incentive development fee revenue is not recognized to the extent that such revenue is subject to future performance contingencies, but rather once the contingency has been resolved. The unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition.
In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability. Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customers credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances. In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible. Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant. However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation. As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities, or VIEs, in which we are the primary beneficiary. The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this report. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Variable Interest Entities As required by the Consolidations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, or Topic 810, we consolidate all VIEs in which we are the entitys primary beneficiary. A reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the VIE. Determining which reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is primarily a qualitative approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has both (1)the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact such entitys economic performance and (2)the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity. The entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
We determine if an entity is a VIE based on several factors, including whether the entitys total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support. We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
39 Table of Contents We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary. We consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities. In addition, we also consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
We also have several co-investments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the qualitative approach for analyzing potential VIEs. We continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates, including estimated future cash flows, asset hold periods and discount rates, as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring. If the entity is a VIE, we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary. This determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an upside economic interest in the form of a promote that we may have. A promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entitys achievement of certain return hurdles.
We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report) and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated. We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations, it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a VIE and whether or not to consolidate such entity.
Limited Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies and Other Subsidiaries If an entity is not a VIE, our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control. For our general partner interests, we are presumed to control (and therefore consolidate) the entity, unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control. These substantive rights allow the limited partners to remove the general partner with or without cause or to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entitys business. We account for our non-controlling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method. This treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies.
Our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but do not control, or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method. Accordingly, our share of the earnings from these equity-method basis companies is included in consolidated net income. All other investments held on a long-term basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value.
Our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors, including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners substantive rights to make decisions for the entity. If we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence, it could result in a different accounting treatment. Accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders equity in any accounting period, but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items, as consolidation would effectively gross up our income statement and balance sheet. If our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different, it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method. Under the cost method, the investor only records its share of the underlying entitys earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee; when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investors share of the investees earnings subsequent to the date of the investors investment, the investor records a reduction in the 40 Table of Contents basis of its investment. Under the cost method, the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee. Conversely, under either consolidation or equity method accounting, the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entitys net income or loss, or its guarantees of the underlying entitys debt.
Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value. When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach. These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc. When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, we use a variety of valuation methods including present value, depreciated replacement cost, market values (where available) and selling prices less costs to dispose. We are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Assumptions must often be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist. Assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates and remaining useful lives. These assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded. Different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities. Since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews.
The majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of CBRE Services, Inc, or CBRE, in 2001 (the 2001 Acquisition), our acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, Inc., or Insignia, in 2003 (the Insignia Acquisition), the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition in 2006 and the REIM Acquisitions in 2011. Other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the REIM Acquisitions, a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, and a trade name separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions. The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, management contracts and loan servicing rights, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process. The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of 41 Table of Contents the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a businesss fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
Our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year. When we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of October1, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value. During the year ended December31, 2012, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $19.8 million in our EMEA segment related to the discontinuation of the use of a trade name in the United Kingdom.
Real Estate As of December31, 2012, the carrying value of our total real estate assets was $379.2 million (4.9% of total assets). The significant accounting policies and estimates with regard to our real estate assets relate to classification and impairment evaluation, cost capitalization and allocation, disposition of real estate and discontinued operations.
Classification and Impairment Evaluation With respect to our real estate assets, the Property, Plant and Equipment, Topic of FASB ASC, or Topic360, establishes criteria to classify an asset as held for sale.Assets included in real estate held for sale consist of completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of Topic 360s held for sale criteria. All other real estate assets are classified in one of the following line items in our consolidated balance sheet: (i)real estate under development (current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date; (ii)real estate under development (non-current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date; or (iii)real estate held for investment, which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the held for sale criteria.
Real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If an assets fair value less cost to sell, based on discounted future cash flows, management estimates or market comparisons, is less than its carrying amount, an allowance is recorded against the asset. Determining an assets fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates.
Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation, as applicable. Buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally up to 39years. Tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the terms of the respective leases. Land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, up to 15 years.
When indicators of impairment are present, real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the assets carrying amount. The amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons. Impairment charges of $26.5 million, $1.7 million and $24.6 million were recorded for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, during the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, we also recorded provisions for loss on real estate held for sale of $2.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively.
42 Table of Contents We evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet. This evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under Topic 360, such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets. The classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment. Had we evaluated our assets differently, the balance sheet classification of such assets, depreciation expense and impairment losses could have been different.
Cost Capitalization and Allocation When acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets, we capitalize costs. Capitalization begins when we determine that activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy, which are timing decisions that require judgment. Costs capitalized include pursuit costs, or pre-acquisition/pre-construction costs, taxes and insurance, interest, development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations. We do not capitalize any internal costs when acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets. We expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB ASC, or Topic 805. Pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined based on our judgment not to pursue are written off in the period that such determination is made. A difference in the timing of when this determination is made could cause the pursuit costs to be expensed in a different period.
At times, we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases. The land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction. We allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases; if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase, we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values, where practicable, or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances. Relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised.
When acquiring real estate with existing buildings, we allocate the purchase price between land, land improvements, building and intangibles related to in-place leases, if any, based on their relative fair values. The fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with lease-up assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition. The fair value of in-place leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or below-market rents and tenant origination costs, determined on a lease by lease basis using assumptions for market rates, absorption periods, lease commissions and tenant improvements. The capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases. Amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense. If we use different estimates in these valuations, the allocation of purchase price to each component could differ, which could cause the amount of amortization related to lease intangibles and tenant origination costs, as well as depreciation of the related building and land improvements to be different.
Disposition of Real Estate Gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project. We evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method. This evaluation requires us to make judgments and estimates in assessing whether a sale has been consummated, the adequacy of the buyers investment, the subordination or collectability of any receivable related to the purchase, and whether we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer, with no substantial continuing involvement by us. If the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment, we account for the sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyers investment and our continuing involvement. In some cases, a deferral method could require the real estate asset and its related liabilities to remain on our balance sheet until the sale qualifies for a different deferral method or full accrual profit recognition.
43 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations Topic 360 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity, and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction. As defined in Topic 360, a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity. Because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary, many constitute a component of an entity under Topic 360, increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur. The evaluation of whether the components cash flows have been eliminated and the level of our continuing involvement require judgment by us and a different assessment could result in items not being reported as discontinued operations.
Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes , Topic of the FASB ASC, or Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Accounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties. We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. We do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods. While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December31, 2012 and 2011 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with Topic 740, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding income taxes.
During 2012, we identified opportunities to repatriate $191.0 million to the United States, $58.0 million in 2012 and $133.0 million in 2013, which resulted in $28.8 million of tax benefit in 2012. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability for $1.1 billion of remaining undistributed earnings of subsidiaries located outside of the United States. Although tax liabilities might result from the payment of dividends out of such earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-U.S. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the United States and we do not have any plans to repatriate these earnings or to sell or liquidate any of these non-U.S. subsidiaries. To the extent that we are able to repatriate the unremitted earnings in a tax efficient manner, or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy in which such funds become needed for funding our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits. The determination of the tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable. Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $263.4 million at December31, 2012.

EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, while amounts shown for EBITDA, as adjusted, remove the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, cost containment and asset impairments. Our management believes that both of these measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculations of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, generally eliminate the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. As a result, our management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant 45 Table of Contents component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs. Additionally, we believe EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
However, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not recognized measurements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our managements discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted for selected charges are calculated as follows: Year Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in thousands) Net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc.

46 Table of Contents Year Ended December31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2011 We reported consolidated net income of $315.6 million for the year ended December31, 2012 on revenue of $6.5 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $239.2 million on revenue of $5.9 billion for the year ended December31, 2011.
Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December31, 2012 increased by $608.7 million, or 10.3%, as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. This increase was driven by contributions from the REIM Acquisitions (acquired in the second half of 2011) as well as higher worldwide sales transaction revenue (up 10.9%), increased commercial mortgage brokerage activity (up 31.3%) and greater outsourcing activity (up 10.1%) also contributed to the variance. Worldwide leasing transaction revenue was essentially flat when compared with the prior year. Foreign currency translation had a $108.2 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December31, 2012.
Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $285.4 million, or 8.3%, during the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs associated with our global property and facilities management contracts. In addition, our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance. Accordingly, the increase in sales transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense. Foreign currency translation had a $58.2 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December31, 2012. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue decreased from 58.5% for the year ended December31, 2011 to 57.5% for the year ended December31, 2012, primarily attributable to our mix of revenue, with a higher composition of revenue being non-commissionable in the current year as a result of the REIM Acquisitions. In addition, all costs associated with the ING REIM businesses are included in operating, administrative and other expenses.
Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $120.2 million, or 6.4%, during the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in costs attributable to the REIM Acquisitions. Additionally, impairment charges of $32.3 million were included in operating, administrative and other expenses for the year ended December31, 2012, and were primarily incurred in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments. Foreign currency translation had a $39.7 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December31, 2012. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 30.7% for the year ended December31, 2012 from 31.9% for the year ended December31, 2011, reflecting the operating leverage inherent in our business.
Our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $53.9 million, or 46.6%, for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. This increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense relative to intangibles acquired in the REIM Acquisitions. Higher depreciation expense in our Americas segment also contributed to the increase.
Our non-amortizable intangible asset impairment on a consolidated basis was $19.8 million for the year ended December31, 2012. This non-cash write-off related to the discontinuation of the use of a trade name in the UnitedKingdom.
Our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was $5.9 million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to $13.0 million for the year ended December31, 2011. These gains resulted from activity within our Development Services and Global Investment Management segments.
Our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis decreased by $44.0 million, or 42.0%, for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. This decrease was primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales within our Development Services segment in the prior year, which did not occur to the same extent in the current year.
47 Table of Contents Our other income on a consolidated basis was $11.1 million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December31, 2011. This activity was primarily reported within our Global Investment Management segment and represented net realized and unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities, which we acquired in our acquisition of CRES. Also contributing to the increase in the current year was $4.3 million of income associated with the sale of a cost investment in our EMEA segment.
Our consolidated interest income decreased by $1.8 million, or 19.1%, as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. This decrease was mainly driven by lower interest income reported in our Americas segment in the current year.
Our consolidated interest expense increased by $24.8 million, or 16.5%, during the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expense attributable to additional borrowings made to finance the REIM Acquisitions in the second and third quarters of 2011 and the British pound sterling A-1 term loan facility entered into in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $185.3 million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to $189.1 million for the year ended December31, 2011. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations, after adjusting pre-tax income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased to 37.1% for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to 44.8% for the year ended December31, 2011. The decreases in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate were primarily the result of non-deductible acquisition costs incurred in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 and the current year benefit from previously unavailable foreign income tax credits that can be utilized to offset U.S. federal income taxes on foreign-sourced earnings, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance, tax expense on dividends and unremitted earnings and an increase in our mix of domestic to foreign earnings.
Our consolidated income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was $0.6 million for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to $49.9 million for the year ended December31, 2011. This income was reported in our Global Investment Management and Development segments and mostly related to gains from property sales, which were largely attributable to non-controlling interests.
Our net loss attributable to non-controlling interests on a consolidated basis was $10.8 million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to net income attributable to non-controlling interests of $51.2 million for the year ended December31, 2011. This activity primarily reflects our non-controlling interests share of income and losses within our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments.
Year Ended December31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2010 We reported consolidated net income of $239.2 million for the year ended December31, 2011 on revenue of $5.9 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $200.3 million on revenue of $5.1 billion for the year ended December31, 2010.
Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December31, 2011 increased by $790.1 million, or 15.4%, as compared to the year ended December31, 2010. This increase was primarily driven by higher worldwide sales (up 24.2%), leasing (up 9.5%) and outsourcing (up 15.0%) activity. Also contributing to the increase was revenue of $84.6 million attributable to the REIM Acquisitions for the year ended December31, 2011. Foreign currency translation had a $143.8 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended December31, 2011.
Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $497.0 million, or 16.8%, during the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December31, 2010. As previously mentioned, our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance. Accordingly, the increase in transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense. Higher salaries and related costs associated with our global property and facilities management contracts also contributed to the increase in cost of services in 2011. Additionally, 48 Table of Contents included in cost of services for the year ended December31, 2011, were cost containment expenses of $20.0 million relating to severance costs incurred to calibrate our staffing levels to the market environment. Foreign currency translation had an $81.7 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended December31, 2011. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 58.5% for the year ended December31, 2011 from 57.9% for the year ended December31, 2010, primarily driven by higher commission tranches achieved in 2011 as a result of the increased transaction revenue and the aforementioned cost containment expenses.
Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $275.0 million, or 17.1%, during the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December31, 2010. The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs, including bonuses, which resulted from our improved operating performance and the REIM Acquisitions. Operating expenses for the year ended December31, 2011 also included $66.7 million of transaction and integration costs incurred in connection with the REIM Acquisitions. Foreign currency translation had a $44.2 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December31, 2011. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 31.9% for the year ended December31, 2011 from 31.4% for the year ended December31, 2010, primarily driven by the aforementioned costs incurred relative to the REIM Acquisitions.
Our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $7.3 million, or 6.8%, for the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December31, 2010. This increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense relative to intangibles acquired in the REIM Acquisitions and other in-fill acquisitions completed in 2011. The increase in amortization expense was partially offset by lower depreciation expense partially stemming from property dispositions in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments in 2011.
Our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was $13.0 million for the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to $7.3 million for the year ended December31, 2010. These gains primarily resulted from activity within our Development Services segment.
Our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $78.2 million, or 294.5%, for the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December31, 2010. This increase was primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales within our Development Services segment in 2011. Also contributing to the increase were lower impairment charges reported by our Global Investment Management segment in 2011.
Our other income on a consolidated basis was $2.7 million for the year ended December31, 2011 and was reported within our Global Investment Management segment. This income primarily represented net realized and unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities, which we acquired in our acquisition of CRES in 2011.
Our consolidated interest income increased by $1.0 million, or 12.2%, as compared to the year ended December31, 2010. This increase was mainly driven by higher interest income reported in our Americas segment in 2011.
Our consolidated interest expense decreased by $40.9 million, or 21.4%, during the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December31, 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense associated with our credit agreement due to debt repayments made in the second half of 2010 and lower interest rates resulting from our refinancing activities in the fourth quarter of 2010. The lower interest expense more than offset the increase in interest expense attributable to additional borrowings made to finance the REIM Acquisitions and the British pound sterling A-1 term loan facility entered into in 2011. This overall net decrease was also partially offset by interest expense incurred related to the $350.0 million of 6.625% senior notes issued on October8, 2010.
Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $189.1 million for the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to $130.4 million for the year ended December31, 2010. Our effective tax rate from 49 Table of Contents continuing operations, after adjusting pre-tax income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, increased to 44.8% for the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to 40.5% for the year ended December31, 2010. The changes in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate were primarily the result of a significant increase in income reported in 2011 and a change in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings (losses). In addition, certain of the transaction costs incurred in connection with the REIM Acquisitions in 2011 were non-deductible.
Our consolidated income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was $49.9 million for the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to $14.3 million for the year ended December31, 2010. The income for the year ended December31, 2011 was reported in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments and mostly related to gains from property sales, which were largely attributable to non-controlling interests. The income for the year ended December31, 2010 was reported in our Development Services segment and mostly related to gains from property sales.
Our net income attributable to non-controlling interests on a consolidated basis was $51.2 million for the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to a net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of $44.3 million for the year ended December31, 2010. This activity primarily reflects our non-controlling interests share of income and losses within our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our expected capital requirements for 2013 include up to approximately $160 million of anticipated net capital expenditures. As of 55 Table of Contents December31, 2012, we had aggregate commitments of $31.7 million to fund future co-investments in our Global Investment Management business, $27.9 million of which is expected to be funded in 2013. Additionally, as of December31, 2012, we had committed to fund $14.3 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our Development Services business, which we may be required to fund at any time. In recent years, the global credit markets have experienced unprecedented tightening, which could affect both the availability and cost of our funding sources in the future.
In 2011, we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING. The acquisitions included substantially all of the ING REIM operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of CRES, its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business, as well as certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia. On July1, 2011, we acquired CRES for $332.8 million and CRES co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $58.6 million, using borrowings from our tranche D term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions. On October3, 2011, we acquired ING REIMs operations in Asia for $45.3 million and three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million, using borrowings from our tranche C term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions. On October31, 2011, we completed the ING REIM Europe portion of the REIM Acquisitions, acquiring ING REIMs operations in Europe for $441.5 million and one co-investment from ING for $7.4 million, using borrowings from our tranche C term loan facility under our credit agreement, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance these transactions. During the year ended December31, 2012, we also funded nine additional co-investments for an aggregate amount of $34.5 million related to ING REIM Europe.
During 2003 and 2006, we required substantial amounts of equity and debt financing to fund our acquisitions of Insignia and Trammell Crow Company. We also conducted two debt offerings in recent years. The first, in 2009, was part of a capital restructuring in response to the global economic recession, and the second, in 2010, was to take advantage of low interest rates and term availability. Absent extraordinary transactions such as these and the equity offerings we completed during the unprecedented global capital markets disruption in 2008 and 2009, we historically have not sought external sources of financing and have relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and investment requirements. In the absence of such extraordinary events, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, but at a minimum for the next 12 months. From time to time, we may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt securities with new debt securities at lower interest rates, longer maturities or better terms.
As evidenced above, from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions. We believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make most likely would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing. In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable. However, it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions.
Our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, generally are comprised of three elements. The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness. We are unable to project with certainty whether our long-term cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due. If our cash flow is insufficient, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates. We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.
The second long-term liquidity need is the repayment of obligations under our pension plans in the United Kingdom. Our subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans 56 Table of Contents to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans. With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually, an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations. Our contributions to these plans are invested and, if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect, we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall. During 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits. In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in the CBRE Group Personal Pension plan, a defined contribution plan in the United Kingdom. The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report was $63.5 million and $60.9 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We expect to contribute a total of $5.5 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending December31, 2013.
The third long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, we had $14.7 million and $12.1 million, respectively, of deferred purchase consideration outstanding included in accounts payable and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report.
Historical Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $291.1 million for the year ended December31, 2012, a decrease of $70.1 million as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the current year was primarily due to higher bonuses, commissions and income taxes paid and activities associated with securities acquired in our acquisition of CRES. In addition, increases in receivables and real estate held for sale and under development in the current year as well as higher tenant concessions received in the prior year also contributed to the variance. These items were partially offset by improved operating performance and an increase in accounts payable in the current year.
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $361.2 million for the year ended December31, 2011, a decrease of $255.4 million as compared to the year ended December31, 2010. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was primarily due to higher bonuses, commissions and income taxes paid in 2011. These items were partially offset by an increase in bonus accruals in 2011, activity associated with securities acquired in our acquisition of CRES, a greater decrease in real estate held for sale and under development in 2011 and a greater increase in receivables in 2010.
Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $197.7 million for the year ended December31, 2012, a decrease of $282.6 million as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in the current year was primarily driven by a greater amount of cash paid for the REIM Acquisitions in the prior year. This was partially offset by higher net proceeds received from the disposition of real estate held for investment in the prior year, a decrease in cash as a result of the deconsolidation of CBRE Clarion U.S., L.P. in the current year and higher distributions from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the prior year.
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $480.3 million for the year ended December31, 2011, an increase of $417.8 million as compared to the year ended December31, 2010. The increase was primarily driven by cash paid for the REIM Acquisitions and higher capital expenditures in 2011. These increases were partially offset by net proceeds received from the disposition of real estate held for investment and higher distributions received from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2011.
Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $100.7 million for the year ended December31, 2012 versus net cash provided by financing activities of $711.3 million for the year ended December31, 2011. The increase in 57 Table of Contents cash used in financing activities was primarily due to $800.0 million of tranche C and D term loan facilities drawn in the prior year to finance the REIM Acquisitions and proceeds from the British pound sterling A-1 term loan facility received in the prior year. This was partially offset by higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate in the prior year, greater distributions to non-controlling interests in the prior year as well as more financing costs paid in the prior year.
Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $711.3 million for the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $784.2 million for the year ended December31, 2010. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds from senior secured loans in 2011 to finance the REIM Acquisitions and the new British pound sterling A-1 term loan facility entered into in 2011 versus significant net repayments of our senior secured term loans in 2010. These items were partially offset by higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our Development Services segment and greater distributions to non-controlling interests in 2011.
Summary of Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments The following is a summary of our various contractual obligations and other commitments as of December31, 2012: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1year 1  3 years 3  5 years More than 5years (Dollars in thousands) Total debt (1) $ 3,526,966 $ 1,172,517 $ 382,128 $ 874,321 $ 1,098,000 Operating leases (2) 1,083,125 176,764 293,876 229,551 382,934 Pension liability (3)(4) 63,528 63,528    Notes payable on real estate (recourse) (5) 13,918 11,311 2,607   Notes payable on real estate (non recourse) (5) 312,094 125,443 170,169 3,454 13,028 Deferred purchase consideration (6) 14,739 6,382 8,357   Total Contractual Obligations $ 5,014,370 $ 1,555,945 $ 857,137 $ 1,107,326 $ 1,493,962 Amount of Other Commitments Expiration Other Commitments Total Less than 1year 13years 35years Morethan 5 years (Dollars in thousands) Letters of credit (2) $ 18,823 $ 18,823 $  $  $  Guarantees (2)(7) 27,182 27,182    Co-investments (2)(8) 46,003 42,166 3,570  267 Non-current tax liabilities (9)      Other (10) 48,418 48,418    Total Other Commitments $ 140,426 $ 136,589 $ 3,570 $  $ 267 (1) See Note 13 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report. Figures do not include scheduled interest payments. Assuming each debt obligation is held until maturity, we estimate that we will make the following interest payments (dollars in thousands): 2013$129,785; 2014 to 2015$248,529; 2016 to 2017$188,847 and thereafter$105,220.

(2) See Note 14 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report.
(3) See Note 15 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report.
(4) Because these obligations are related, either wholly or partially, to the future retirement of our employees and such retirement dates are not predictable, an undeterminable portion of this amount will be paid in years one through five.
58 Table of Contents (5) See Note 12 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report. Figures do not include scheduled interest payments. The notes (primarily construction loans) have either fixed or variable interest rates, ranging from 2.46% to 8.75% at December31, 2012. In general, interest is drawn on the underlying loan and subsequently paid with proceeds received upon the sale of the real estate project.
(6) Represents deferred obligations related to previous in-fill acquisitions, which are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December31, 2012 set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report.
(7) Due to the nature of guarantees, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain triggering events including default. Accordingly, all guarantees are reflected as expiring in less than one year.
(8) Includes $31.7 million related to our Global Investment Management segment, $27.9 million of which is expected to be funded in 2013 and $14.3 million related to our Development Services segment (callable at any time).
(9) As of December31, 2012, our current and non-current tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, totaled $94.3 million. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions.
(10) Represents outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs, which are included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December31, 2012 set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report. Due to the nature of this item, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain events. Accordingly, the entire balance has been reflected as expiring in less than one year.
Significant Indebtedness Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.
Since 2001, we have maintained credit facilities with Credit Suisse Group AG, or CS, and other lenders to fund strategic acquisitions and to provide for our working capital needs. On November10, 2010, we entered into a new credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks led by CS, as administrative and collateral agent, to completely refinance our previous credit facilities. On March4, 2011, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase flexibility to various covenants to accommodate the REIM Acquisitions and to maintain the availability of the $800.0 million incremental facility under the Credit Agreement. On March4, 2011, we also entered into an incremental assumption agreement to allow for the establishment of new tranche C and tranche D term loan facilities. On November10, 2011, we entered into an incremental assumption agreement led jointly by HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to allow for the establishment of a new tranche A-1 term loan facility, which also reduced the $800.0 million incremental facility under the Credit Agreement.
Our Credit Agreement currently provides for the following: (1)a $700.0 million revolving credit facility, including revolving credit loans, letters of credit and a swingline loan facility, maturing on May10, 2015; (2)a $350.0 million tranche A term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on December31, 2010 and continue through September30, 2015, with the balance payable on November10, 2015; (3)a 187.0million (approximately $300.0 million) tranche A-1 term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on December30, 2011 and continue through March31, 2016, with the balance payable on May10, 2016; (4)a $300.0 million tranche B term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on December31, 2010 and continue through September30, 2016, with the balance payable on November10, 2016; (5)a $400.0 million tranche C term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on September30, 2011 and continue through December31, 2017, with the balance payable on 59 Table of Contents March4, 2018; (6)a $400.0 million tranche D term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on September30, 2011 and continue through June30, 2019, with the balance payable on September4, 2019 and (7)an accordion provision which provides the ability to borrow additional funds under an incremental facility. The incremental facility is equivalent to the sum of $800.0 million and the aggregate amount of all repayments of term loans and permanent reductions of revolver commitments under the Credit Agreement. However, at no time may the sum of all outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement exceed $2.95 billion. On November10, 2011, we utilized the incremental facility to issue the tranche A-1 term loan facility.
On June30, 2011, we drew down $400.0 million of the tranche D term loan facility to finance the CRES portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on July1, 2011. On August31, 2011, we drew down $400.0 million of the tranche C term loan facility, part of which was used to finance the ING REIM Asia portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on October3, 2011. The remaining borrowings were used to finance the acquisition of ING REIMs operations in Europe, which closed on October31, 2011.
The revolving credit facility allows for borrowings outside of the United States, with sub-facilities of $5.0 million available to one of our Canadian subsidiaries, $35.0 million in aggregate available to one of our Australian and one of our New Zealand subsidiaries and $50.0 million available to one of our U.K. subsidiaries. Additionally, outstanding borrowings under these sub-facilities may be up to 5.0% higher as allowed under the currency fluctuation provision in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of December31, 2012 bear interest at varying rates, based at our option, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 1.65% to 3.15% or the daily rate plus 0.65% to 2.15% as determined by reference to our ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of December31, 2012 and 2011, we had $73.0 million and $44.8 million, respectively, of revolving credit facility principal outstanding with related weighted average interest rates of 3.2% and 4.3%, respectively, which are included in short-term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report. As of December31, 2012, letters of credit totaling $16.9 million were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. These letters of credit were primarily issued in the normal course of business as well as in connection with certain insurance programs and reduce the amount we may borrow under the revolving credit facility.
Borrowings under the term loan facilities as of December31, 2012 bear interest, based at our option, on the following: for the tranche A and A-1 term loan facilities, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 2.00% to 3.75% or the daily rate plus 1.00% to 2.75%, as determined by reference to our ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), for the tranche B term loan facility, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 3.25% or the daily rate plus 2.25%, for the tranche C term loan facility, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 3.25% or the daily rate plus 2.25% and for the tranche D term loan facility, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 3.50% or the daily rate plus 2.50%. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, we had $271.2 million and $306.3 million, respectively, of tranche A term loan facility principal outstanding, $275.2 million and $285.1 million, respectively, of tranche A-1 term loan facility principal outstanding, $293.3 million and $296.3 million, respectively, of tranche B term loan facility principal outstanding, $394.0 million and $398.0 million, respectively, of tranche C term loan facility principal outstanding and $394.0 million and $398.0 million, respectively, of tranche D term loan facility principal outstanding, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report.
In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities. The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019. There was no hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, the fair values of these interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a $48.0 million liability and a $39.9 million liability, respectively, and were included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report.
60 Table of Contents The Credit Agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our U.S. subsidiaries and 65.0% of the capital stock of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.

This agreement provides for a $200.0 million senior secured revolving line of credit and bears interest at the daily one-month LIBOR plus 1.9% with a maturity date of July29, 2013.
On September21, 2012, CBRE Capital Markets entered into a repurchase facility with JP Morgan for additional warehouse capacity pursuant to a Master Repurchase Agreement. This agreement provides for a $300.0 million warehouse facility and bears interest at the daily one-month LIBOR plus 2.25% with a maturity date of September20,2013.
During the year ended December31, 2012, we had a maximum of $1.0 billion of warehouse lines of credit principal outstanding. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, we had $1.0 billion and $713.4 million of warehouse lines of credit principal outstanding, respectively, which are included in short-term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, we had $1.0 billion and $720.1 million of mortgage loans held for sale (warehouse receivables), as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which substantially represented mortgage loans funded through the lines of credit that, while committed to be purchased, had not yet been purchased and which are also included in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report.
63 Table of Contents Pension Liability Our subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans. The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report was $63.5 million and $60.9 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We expect to contribute a total of $5.5 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending December31, 2013.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $18.8 million as of December31, 2012, excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases. These letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the ordinary course of business and expire at varying dates through December 2013.
We had guarantees totaling $27.2 million as of December31, 2012, excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities, consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet, and operating leases. The $27.2 million primarily consists of guarantees related to our defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom (in excess of our outstanding pension liability of $63.5 million as of December31, 2012), which are continuous guarantees that will not expire until all amounts have been paid out for our pension liabilities. The remainder of the guarantees mainly represents guarantees of obligations of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which expire at varying dates through August 2015, as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas, which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.
In addition, as of December31, 2012, we had numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects. These guarantees are made by us in the ordinary course of our Development Services business. Each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget. However, we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees. These contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors. While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees.
In January 2008, CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc., or CBRE MCI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae, under Fannie Maes Delegated Underwriting and Servicing Lender Program, or DUS Program, to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units.Under the DUS Program, CBRE MCI originates, underwrites, closes and services loans without prior approval by Fannie Mae, and in selected cases, is subject to sharing up to one-third of any losses on loans originated under the DUS Program. CBRE MCI has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of $5.8 billion at December31, 2012.Additionally, CBRE MCI has funded loans under the DUS Program that are not subject to loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of approximately $492.6 million at December31, 2012.CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur.As of December31, 2012 and 2011, CBRE MCI had $9.1 million and $4.6 million, respectively, of cash deposited under this reserve arrangement, and had provided approximately $10.6 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of loan loss accruals. Fannie Maes recourse under the DUS Program is limited to the assets of CBRE MCI, which totaled approximately $553.2 million (including $446.5 million of warehouse receivables, a substantial majority of which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to Fannie Mae) at December31, 2012.
An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients. These co-investments typically range from 2.0% to 64 Table of Contents 5.0% of the equity in a particular fund. As of December31, 2012, we had aggregate commitments of $31.7 million to fund future co-investments, $27.9 million of which is expected to be funded in 2013. In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments.
Additionally, an important part of our Development Services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal (in most cases co-investing with our clients). As of December31, 2012, we had committed to fund $14.3 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries, which may be called at any time.
Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which can affect an investors ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Historically, this seasonality has caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year. Earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar year-end. This has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter, with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter.
Inflation Our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation. However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.
New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2011-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Derecognition of in Substance Real Estatea Scope Clarification.
This ASU requires that a reporting entity that ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiarys nonrecourse debt would apply FASB ASC Subtopic 360-20, Property, Plant, and EquipmentReal Estate Sales , to determine whether to derecognize assets and liabilities of that subsidiary. ASU 2011-10 is effective prospectively for a deconsolidation event that takes place in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June15, 2012. We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
This ASU adds certain additional disclosure requirements about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are subject to netting arrangements. In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, which clarifies that ordinary trade receivables and receivables in general are not in the scope of ASU 2011-11. Both ASU 2011-11 and ASU 2013-01 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after January1, 2013, with retrospective application required. We do not believe the adoption of these updates will have a material impact on the disclosure requirements for our consolidated financial statements.
Item7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations. We manage such risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments.
65 Table of Contents We apply the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 815) when accounting for derivative financial instruments. In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
Exchange Rates During the year ended December31, 2012, approximately 40% of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries, the majority of which includes the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese yuan, the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen, the Singapore dollar, the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee. We attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities, which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into U.S. dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates, and our total revenue and expenses, which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into U.S. dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate. During the year ended December31, 2012, foreign currency translation had a $108.2 million negative impact on our total revenue and a $97.9 million positive impact on our total costs of services and operating, administrative and other expenses.
We routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate. In the normal course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans, expected cash flow and earnings. Included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report were charges of $4.4 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, resulting from net losses on foreign currency exchange option agreements. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding.
Interest Rates We manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt. Excluding notes payable on real estate, our fixed and variable rate long-term debt at December31, 2012 consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): Year of Maturity Fixed Rate LIBOR +2.25% (1) LIBOR + 3.25% (1) LIBOR + 3.50% (1) (2) (3) Total 2013 $ 2,495 $ 59,677 $ 7,000 $ 4,000 $ 1,026,381 $ 72,964 $ 1,172,517 2014 2,686 65,372 7,000 4,000   79,058 2015 2,741 289,329 7,000 4,000   303,070 2016 1,430 132,118 288,250 4,000   425,798 2017 440,523  4,000 4,000   448,523 Thereafter 350,000  374,000 374,000   1,098,000 Total $ 799,875 $ 546,496 $ 687,250 $ 394,000 $ 1,026,381 $ 72,964 $ 3,526,966 Weighted Average Interest Rate 9.4 % 2.6 % 3.5 % 3.7 % 2.3 % 3.2 % 4.4 % (1) Consists of amounts due under our senior secured term loan facilities.
(2) Consists of amounts due under our warehouse lines of credit as follows (dollars in thousands): $452,656 at daily one-month LIBOR + 2.25%; $295,593 at daily one-month LIBOR + 2.00%; $161,342 at daily one-month LIBOR + 1.90%; $78,072 at daily Chase-London LIBOR + 2.50% and $38,718 at daily LIBOR + 1.35% with a LIBOR floor of 0.35%.
66 Table of Contents (3) Consists of amounts due under our revolving credit facility as follows (dollars in thousands): $48,725 at LIBOR + 1.85%; $17,775 at Australia Bill Rate + 1.85% and $6,464 at New Zealand Bill Rate + 1.85%.
We utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt. If interest rates were to increase by 10.0% on our outstanding variable rate debt, excluding notes payable on real estate, at December31, 2012, the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of $7.9 million on pre-tax income and a decrease of $7.9 million on cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December31, 2012.
Based upon information from third-party banks, the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately $1.6 billion at December31, 2012. Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair values of our 6.625% senior notes and 11.625% senior subordinated notes were $385.0 million and $488.8 million, respectively, at December31, 2012.
In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with Topic 815. The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities. The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019. There was no hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011. As of December31, 2012, the fair values of these interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a $48.0 million liability and were included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item8 of this Annual Report.
We also have $326.0 million of notes payable on real estate as of December31, 2012. These notes have interest rates ranging from 2.46% to 8.75% with maturity dates extending through 2023. Interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate. If interest rates were to increase by 10.0%, our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December31, 2012. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate. If any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges, then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings. The net impact on our earnings resulting from gains and/or losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant.
We also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale. Topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives. The net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these derivatives contracts has not been significant.

68 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders CBRE Group, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CBRE Group, Inc. (the Company) and subsidiaries as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2012. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the related financial statement schedules. We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CBRE Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, 69 Table of Contents present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, CBRE Group, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Nature of Operations CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (which may be referred to in these financial statements as the company, we, us and our), was incorporated on February20, 2001. We are the worlds largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2012 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate. As of December31, 2012, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in more than 300 offices worldwide, with approximately 37,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name. Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, real estate investment management, valuation, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research. We generate revenue from management fees on a contractual and per-project basis, and from commissions on transactions. Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses, which generally involve facilities management, property management, mortgage loan servicing and investment management, represented approximately 41% of our 2012 revenue.
2. Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIEs) in which we are the primary beneficiary and other subsidiaries of which we have control. The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Variable Interest Entities As required by the Consolidations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 810), we consolidate all VIEs in which we are the entitys primary beneficiary. A reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the VIE. Determining which reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is primarily a qualitative approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has both (1)the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact such entitys economic performance and (2)the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity. The entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
We determine if an entity is a VIE based on several factors, including whether the entitys total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support. We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary. We consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities. In addition, we also consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
76 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) We also have several co-investments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the qualitative approach for analyzing potential VIEs. We continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates, including estimated future cash flows, asset hold periods and discount rates, as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring. If the entity is a VIE, we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary. This determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an upside economic interest in the form of a promote that we may have. A promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entitys achievement of certain return hurdles.
We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 4) and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated. We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations, it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a VIE and whether or not to consolidate such entity.
Limited Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies and Other Subsidiaries If an entity is not a VIE, our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control. For our general partner interests, we are presumed to control (and therefore consolidate) the entity, unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control. These substantive rights allow the limited partners to remove the general partner with or without cause or to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entitys business. We account for our non-controlling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method. This treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies.
Our determination of the appropriate accounting method for all other investments in subsidiaries is based on the amount of influence we have (including our ownership interest) in the underlying entity. Those other investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence (but not control) over operating and financial policies of such subsidiaries (including certain subsidiaries where we have less than 20% ownership) are accounted for using the equity method. We eliminate transactions with such equity method subsidiaries to the extent of our ownership in such subsidiaries. Accordingly, our share of the earnings or losses of these equity method subsidiaries is included in consolidated net income. All of our remaining investments are carried at cost.
Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value. When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach. These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc. When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
Estimates, Risks and Uncertainties Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.), which require management to make estimates and assumptions 77 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses we report. Such estimates include the value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, accounts receivable, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, retirement and other post-employment benefits, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best judgment, and are evaluated on an ongoing basis and adjusted, as needed, using historical experience and other factors, including consideration of the macroeconomic environment. The after-effects of the recent global financial crisis, including highly volatile credit, equity and foreign currency markets and a slow and uneven global economic recovery, have increased the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be forecast with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
The fair value of our goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets is impacted by economic and capital market conditions as well as our stock price.Property sales and leasing activity is affected by economic and employment growth, capital markets liquidity, credit availability and pricing, business and investor confidence, and inflation levels. Adverse trends involving any or all of these factors could reduce transaction-based revenue as well as property values and sales volume. Such adverse economic conditions could cause declines in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected for our reporting units.A major or sustained decline in our future cash flows and/or the current economic conditions could result in additional impairment charges.
The recoverability of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries has been impacted by the continuing effects of the global financial crisis. This was initially evident in sharply reduced property sales activity and decreasing property values throughout 2009. As liquidity subsequently improved, transaction activity has revived for the past three years from the low levels of 2008 and 2009, but has remained well below the volume experienced in 2006 and 2007. Property values also have rebounded, but price appreciation has been most significant in top-tier assets and in the largest, most liquid markets. The assumptions utilized in our recoverability analysis reflect our belief that the recovery from the severe downturn will continue to be slow and gradual, and that challenging market conditions could result in further write-downs, especially if heightened capital markets turmoil returns.
The recoverability of the carrying value of our investments in real estate is impacted by general conditions in the U.S. economy and commercial real estate market. Market fundamentals in the primary property types that we develop or own weakened significantly in late 2008 and throughout 2009. Falling employment levels negatively impacted office markets as companies reduced their occupancy requirements and placed space on the market for sublease. Weak industrial production adversely affected warehouse and distribution markets. The retail sector was negatively affected by declining consumer spending, and the resulting impact on retail sales. These trends have improved, to varying degrees, over the past three years. Property sales have increased steadily as investor confidence and liquidity returned to the commercial real estate market. However, if conditions in the broader economy, capital markets, local, regional or global commercial real estate markets decline sharply once again, we may be required to record additional impairment charges.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months. Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2012 and 2011 is cash and cash equivalents of $94.6 million and $208.1 million, respectively, from consolidated funds and other entities, which is not available for general corporate use. We also manage certain cash and cash equivalents as an agent for our investment and property and facilities management clients. These amounts are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (see Note 19).
78 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Restricted Cash Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2012 and 2011 is restricted cash of $73.7 million and $67.1 million, respectively. The balances primarily include restricted cash set aside to cover funding obligations as required by contracts executed by us in the normal course of business, including escrow accounts held in our Development Services segment.
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and interest-bearing investments. Users of real estate services account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required. The risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the large number of users and their geographic dispersion.
We place substantially all of our interest-bearing investments with major financial institutions and triple-A rated money market funds and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging up to 15 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of their associated leases, excluding options to renew, since such leases generally do not carry prohibitive penalties for non-renewal. We capitalize expenditures that materially increase the life of our assets and expense the costs of maintenance and repairs.
We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If this review indicates that such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is recognized in the period the changes occur and represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. During the year ended December31, 2012, we recorded an impairment loss related to property and equipment of $5.8 million (see Note 5 for additional information). We did not recognize an impairment loss related to property and equipment in 2011 or 2010.
Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized. Internal computer software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Direct consulting costs as well as payroll and related costs, which are incurred during the development stage of a project are generally capitalized and amortized over a three-year period (except for enterprise software development platforms, which range from five to ten years) when placed into production.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE) in 2001 (the 2001 Acquisition), our acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, Inc. (Insignia) in 2003 (the Insignia Acquisition), our acquisition of the Trammell Crow Company in 2006 (the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition) and our acquisition of substantially all of the ING Group N.V. (ING) Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES) in 2011 (collectively referred to as 79 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) the REIM Acquisitions). Other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the REIM Acquisitions, a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions. The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, management contracts and loan servicing rights, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process. The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a businesss fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred in connection with financing activities are generally deferred and amortized over the terms of the related debt agreements ranging up to ten years. Amortization of these costs is charged to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Total deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were $42.2 million and $51.5 million as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
In connection with the credit agreement we entered into on November10, 2010, we wrote off financing costs of $16.7 million during the year ended December31, 2010, including $12.1 million of credit agreement amendment fees paid in November 2010 and $4.6 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our prior credit agreement. In addition, in October 2010, we wrote off $1.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with debt repayments made. All of these write-offs were included in write-off of financing costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 13 for additional information on activities associated with our debt.
Revenue Recognition We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist. Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied. Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first months rent (or a combination thereof). As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
80 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) A typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent. The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied. For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first months rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
Property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed. These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements.
Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners. Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments. These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements. Our Global Investment Management segment earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments. Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision. With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management team has participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest. This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period. In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts. Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
Appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered. Loan origination fees are recognized at the time a loan closes and we have no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction, while loan servicing fees are recorded in revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors. Other commissions, consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as revenue at the time the related services have been performed, unless significant future contingencies exist.
Development services and project management services generate fees from development and construction management projects. Most development and construction management and project management assignments are subject to agreements that describe the calculation of fees and when we earn such fees. The earnings terms of these agreements dictate when we recognize the related revenue. Generally development fees are recognized based on the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straight-line basis over the development period. We may earn incentive fees for project management services based upon achievement of certain performance criteria as set forth in the project management services agreement. We may earn incentive development fees by reaching specified time table, leasing, budget or value creation targets, as defined in the relevant development services agreement. Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost. This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost. We recognize such fees when the specified target is attained and fees are deemed collectible.
We record deferred income to the extent that cash payments have been received in accordance with the terms of underlying agreements, but such amounts have not yet met the criteria for revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We recognize such revenues when the appropriate criteria are met.
81 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) We account for certain reimbursements (primarily salaries and related charges) mainly related to our facilities and property management operations as revenue. Reimbursement revenue is recognized when the underlying reimbursable costs are incurred.
In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability. Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customers credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances. In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible. Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant. However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation. As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
Real Estate Classification and Impairment Evaluation We classify real estate in accordance with the criteria of the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 360) as follows: (i)real estate held for sale, which includes completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of Topic 360s held for sale criteria, (ii)real estate under development (current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date; (iii)real estate under development (non-current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date; or (iv)real estate held for investment, which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the held for sale criteria. Any asset reclassified from real estate held for sale to real estate under development (current or non-current) or real estate held for investment is recorded individually at the lower of its fair value at the date of the reclassification or its carrying amount before it was classified as held for sale, adjusted (in the case of real estate held for investment) for any depreciation that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as real estate held for investment.
Real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. If an assets fair value less cost to sell, based on discounted future cash flows, management estimates or market comparisons, is less than its carrying amount, an allowance is recorded against the asset.
Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation, as applicable. Buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally up to 39years. Tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or terms of the respective leases. Land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, up to 15 years.
Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the assets carrying amount. The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is calculated as the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons.
82 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Cost Capitalization and Allocation When acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets, we capitalize costs. Capitalization begins when the activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy. Costs capitalized include pursuit costs, or pre-acquisition/pre-construction costs, taxes and insurance, interest, development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations. We do not capitalize any internal costs when acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets. We expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 805). Pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined not to pursue are written off in the period that determination is made.
At times, we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases. The land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction. We allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases; if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase, we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values, where practicable, or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances. Relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised.
When acquiring real estate with existing buildings, we allocate the purchase price between land, land improvements, building and intangibles related to in-place leases, if any, based on their relative fair values. The fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with lease-up assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition. The fair value of in-place leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or below-market rents and tenant origination costs, determined on a lease by lease basis. The capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases. Amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense.
Disposition of Real Estate Gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project. We evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method. If the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment, we account for a sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyers investment and our continuing involvement.
Discontinued Operations Topic 360 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity, and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction. As defined in Topic 360, a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity. Because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary, many constitute a component of an entity under Topic 360, increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets that we hold for sale in the ordinary course of business must be reported as a discontinued operation unless we have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the asset after its disposition. Furthermore, operating profits and losses on such assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur.
83 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Business Promotion and Advertising Costs The costs of business promotion and advertising are expensed as incurred. Business promotion and advertising costs of $43.7 million, $42.5 million and $37.5 million were included in operating, administrative and other expenses for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Foreign Currencies The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the U.S. are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rate. The resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations. The aggregate transaction losses included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $3.6 million, $0.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities As required by FASB ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging , we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting. In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive (loss) income. In the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized losses on interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, unrealized holding gains on available for sale securities and other pension liability adjustments. Foreign currency translation adjustments exclude any income tax effect given that earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time (see Note 16).
Marketable Securities We account for investments in marketable debt and equity securities in accordance with the Investments Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 320). We determine the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. Marketable securities we acquire with the intent to generate a profit from short-term movements in market prices 84 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) are classified as trading securities. Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Marketable equity and debt securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale.
Trading securities are carried at their fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net income. Available for sale securities are carried at their fair value and any difference between cost and fair value is recorded as unrealized gain or loss, net of income taxes, and is reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of equity. Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the effective interest method. Realized gains and losses and declines in value expected to be other-than-temporary on available for sale securities have not been significant. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income.
Warehouse Receivables Our wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Capital Markets is a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) approved Multifamily Program Plus Seller/Servicer and an approved Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) Aggregation and Negotiated Transaction Seller/Servicer. In addition, CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary Multifamily Capital is an approved Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) Seller/Servicer and CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE HMF is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved Non-Supervised Federal Housing Authority (FHA) Title II Mortgagee, an approved Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) lender and an approved Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) issuer of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).Under these arrangements, before loans are originated through proceeds from warehouse lines of credit, we obtain either a contractual loan purchase commitment from either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS that will be secured by the loans. The warehouse lines of credit are generally repaid within a one-month period when Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae buys the loans or upon settlement of the Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS, while we retain the servicing rights. Loans are funded at the prevailing market rates. We elect the fair value option for all warehouse receivables. At December31, 2012 and 2011, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans.
Mortgage Servicing Rights In connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans with servicing rights retained, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights on the date the loans are sold. We also assume or purchase certain servicing assets. Servicing assets are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections and timing of estimated future net cash flows.
85 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Our recording of mortgage servicing rights at their fair value resulted in net gains, which have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The amount of mortgage servicing rights recognized during the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011 was as follows (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December31, 2012 2011 Beginning balance, mortgage servicing rights $ 95,343 $ 65,319 Mortgage servicing rights recognized 83,721 56,775 Mortgage servicing rights sold (10,297 ) (10,421 ) Amortization expense (23,812 ) (16,330 ) Ending balance, mortgage servicing rights $ 144,955 $ 95,343 Mortgage servicing rights do not actively trade in an open market with readily available observable prices; therefore, fair value is determined based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the estimation of the present value of future cash flows realized from servicing the underlying mortgage loans. Managements assumptions include the benefits of servicing (servicing fee income and interest on escrow deposits), inflation, the cost of servicing, prepayment rates, delinquencies, discount rate and the estimated life of servicing cash flows.The assumptions used are subject to change based on managements judgments and estimates of changes in future cash flows and interest rates, among other things. The key assumptions used during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 in measuring fair value were as follows: Year Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 Discount rate 15.00 % 15.00 % 15.00 % Conditional prepayment rate 7.00 % 7.00 % 7.00 % Inflation 2.50 % 2.50 % 2.50 % Delinquencies    The estimated fair value of our mortgage servicing rights was $165.4 million and $111.1 million as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We did not incur any impairment charges related to our servicing rights during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 or 2010.
Included in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are contractually specified servicing fees from loans serviced for others of $40.0 million, $28.2 million and $21.7 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively and late fees/ancillary income earned from loans serviced for others of $0.8 million, $1.5 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Accounting for Broker Draws As part of our recruitment efforts relative to new U.S. brokers, we offer a transitional broker draw arrangement. Our broker draw arrangements generally last until such time as a brokers pipeline of business is sufficient to allow him or her to earn sustainable commissions. This program is intended to provide the broker with a minimal amount of cash flow to allow adequate time for his or her training as well as time for him or her to develop business relationships. Similar to traditional salaries, the broker draws are paid irrespective of the actual revenues generated by the broker. Often these broker draws represent the only form of compensation received by the broker. Furthermore, it is not our general policy to pursue collection of unearned broker draws paid under this arrangement. As a result, we have concluded that broker draws are economically equivalent to 86 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) salaries paid and accordingly charge them to compensation as incurred. The broker is also entitled to earn a commission on completed revenue transactions. This amount is calculated as the commission that would have been payable under our full commission program, less any amounts previously paid to the broker in the form of a draw.
Stock-Based Compensation We account for all employee awards under the fair value recognition provisions of the Compensation Stock Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 718). Topic 718 requires the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date, based upon the estimated fair value of the award, and requires amortization of the related expense over the employees requisite service period. See Note 15 for additional information on our stock-based compensation plans.
Income Per Share Basic income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. is computed by dividing net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. The computation of diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. generally further assumes the dilutive effect of potential common shares, which include stock options and certain contingently issuable shares. Contingently issuable shares consist of non-vested stock awards.
Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 740). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Self-Insurance Our wholly-owned captive insurance company, which is subject to applicable insurance rulesand regulations, insures our exposure related to workers compensation insurance provided to employees and purchases excess coverage from an unrelated insurance carrier. We purchase general liability and automotive insurance through an unrelated insurance carrier. The captive insurance company reinsures the related deductibles. The captive insurance company also insures deductibles relating to professional indemnity claims. Given the nature of these types of claims, it may take several years for resolution and determination of the cost of these claims. We are required to estimate the cost of these claims in our financial statements.
The estimates that we utilize to record our potential losses on claims are inherently subjective, and actual claims could differ from amounts recorded, which could result in increased or decreased expense in future periods. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, our reserves for claims under these insurance programs were $48.4million and $51.8 million, respectively, which were included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Of these amounts, $11.9 million and $16.1 million, respectively, represented our estimated current liabilities as of December31, 2012 and 2011.
87 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Limited Life Subsidiaries As of December31, 2012, the estimated settlement value of non-controlling interests in our consolidated limited life subsidiaries was $68.4 million, as compared to the carrying value of $61.7 million, which was included in non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of December31, 2011, the estimated settlement value of non-controlling interests in our consolidated limited life subsidiaries approximated the carrying value of $79.3 million, which was included in non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Derecognition of in Substance Real Estatea Scope Clarification.
This ASU requires that a reporting entity that ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiarys nonrecourse debt would apply FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 360-20, Property, Plant, and EquipmentReal Estate Sales, to determine whether to derecognize assets and liabilities of that subsidiary. ASU 2011-10 is effective prospectively for a deconsolidation event that takes place in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June15, 2012. We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
This ASU adds certain additional disclosure requirements about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are subject to netting arrangements. In January 2013, the FASBissued ASU 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, which clarifies that ordinary trade receivables and receivables in general are not in the scope of ASU 2011-11. Both ASU 2011-11 and ASU 2013-01 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after January1, 2013, with retrospective application required. We do not believe the adoption of these updates will have a material impact on the disclosure requirements for our consolidated financial statements.
3. REIM Acquisitions In 2011, we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING. The acquisitions included substantially all of INGs REIM operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of CRES, its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM) along with certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia. Upon completion of the acquisitions (collectively referred to as the REIM Acquisitions), ING REIM became part of our Global Investment Management segment (which conducts business through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Global Investors, an independently operated business segment). We completed the REIM Acquisitions in order to significantly enhance our ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies.
We secured borrowings of $800.0 million of term loans to finance the REIM Acquisitions (see Note 13). Of this amount, $400.0 million was drawn on June30, 2011 to finance the CRES portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on July1, 2011. On August31, 2011, we drew down the remaining $400.0 million, part of which was used to finance the ING REIM Asia portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on October3, 2011, 88 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) and the remainder, along with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, was used to finance the ING REIM Europe portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on October31, 2011.
The following represents a summary of the purchase price for the REIM Acquisitions (dollars in thousands): Purchase of CRES on July1, 2011 $ 332,845 Purchase of CRES co-investments on July1, 2011 58,566 Purchase of ING REIM Asia on October3, 2011 45,315 Purchase of ING REIM Europe on October31, 2011 441,515 Total purchase price $ 878,241 In connection with our acquisition of CRES, we acquired CRES co-investments from ING in three funds (CRES Funds) for an aggregate purchase price of $58.6 million, which has been included above. We determined that the CRES Funds were not VIEs and accordingly determined the method of accounting based upon voting control. The limited partners/members of the CRES Funds lack substantive rights that would overcome our presumption of control. Accordingly, we began consolidating the CRES Funds as of the acquisition date of July1, 2011. In connection with the REIM Acquisitions, we also acquired three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million on October3, 2011 and several ING REIM Europe co-investments, including one for $7.4 million on October31, 2011, and nine additional co-investments for an aggregate amount of $34.5 million during the year ended December31, 2012.
In January 2012, one of the CRES Funds (CBRE Clarion U.S., L.P.) was converted to a registered mutual fund, the CBRE Clarion Long/Short Fund (the Fund). As a result of this triggering event, we determined that the Fund became a VIE and that we were not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2012, the Fund was deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements and we recorded an investment in available for sale securities of $14.3 million. No gain or loss was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations as a result of this deconsolidation. We continue to act as the Funds adviser, make investment decisions for the Fund and review, supervise and administer the Funds investment program.
The purchase accounting for the REIM Acquisitions has been finalized. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired has been recorded to goodwill. The goodwill arising from the REIMAcquisitions consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations acquired from ING with ours. Only $8.3 million of the goodwill recorded in connection with the REIM Acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes. There were no significant adjustments to the purchase price allocation recorded during the year ended December31, 2012.
The consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2011 includes revenue, operating income and net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. of $84.6 million, $15.7 million and $9.1 million, respectively, attributable to the REIM Acquisitions. This does not include direct transaction and integration costs incurred during the year ended December31, 2011 of $66.7 million in connection with the REIM Acquisitions.
Unaudited pro forma results, assuming the REIM Acquisitions had occurred as of January1, 2010 for purposes of the 2011 and 2010 pro forma disclosures, are presented below. They include certain adjustments for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, including $14.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, of increased amortization expense as a result of intangible assets acquired in the REIM Acquisitions, $18.9 million and $32.8 million, respectively, of additional interest expense as a result of debt incurred to finance the REIM Acquisitions, the removal of $73.0million of direct costs incurred by us and ING related to the REIM Acquisitions for the year ended December31, 2011, and the tax impact in both years of the pro forma 89 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) A consolidated subsidiary (the Venture) in our Global Investment Management segment has sponsored investments by third-party investors in certain commercial properties through the formation of tenant-in-common limited liability companies and Delaware Statutory Trusts (collectively referred to as the Entities) that are owned by the third-party investors. The Venture also has formed and is a member of a limited liability company for each property that serves as master tenant (Master Tenant). Each Master Tenant leases the property from the Entities through a master lease agreement. Pursuant to the master lease agreements, the Master Tenant has the power to direct the day-to-day asset management activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the Entities. As a result, the Entities were deemed to be VIEs since the third-party investors holding the equity investment at risk in the Entities do not direct the day-to-day activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the properties held by the Entities. The Venture has made and may continue to make voluntary contributions to each of these properties to support their operations beyond the cash flow generated by the properties themselves. As of the most recent reconsideration date, such financial support has been significant enough that the Venture was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of each Entity.
During the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Venture funded $0.2 million, $0.2million and $1.2 million, respectively, of financial support to the Entities.
The Entities were initially consolidated by the Venture upon adoption of ASU 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved With Variable Interest Entities, on January1, 2010. The Entities assets and associated mortgage notes payable aggregated $251.0 million and $221.5 million, respectively, and were recorded based on their fair value at adoption. We did not recognize a gain or loss on the initial consolidation of these Entities. The assets of the Entities are the sole collateral for the mortgage notes payable and other liabilities of the Entities and as such, the creditors and equity investors of these Entities have no recourse to our assets held outside of these Entities. During the year ended December31, 2011, five of the original eight commercial properties were sold. During the year ended December31, 2012, an additional Entity was consolidated during the first quarter and subsequently sold in the fourth quarter.

Fair Value Measurements The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 820) defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Topic 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:  Level 1Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Fair value measurements for our available for sale securities are obtained from independent pricing services which utilize observable market data that may include quoted market prices, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield curve, trading levels, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the instruments terms and conditions.
The trading securities and securities sold, not yet purchased are primarily in the U.S. and are generally valued at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation or, if no sales occurred on the valuation date, at the mean of the bid and asked prices on such date.
The fair values of the warehouse receivables are calculated based on already locked in security buy prices.At December31, 2012 and 2011, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying warehouse lines of credit (See Note 2). These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as all inputs are readily observable.
The valuation of interest rate swaps is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts.The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate forward curves. To comply with the provisions of Topic 820, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. In conjunction with our adoption of ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs , we made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of our derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio. Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties. However, as of December31, 2012, we have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Inputs used in these evaluations included risk-free rates of return, estimated risk premiums as well as other economic variables.
Property and Equipment During the year ended December31, 2012, we recorded an asset impairment of $5.8 million in our Americas segment. This non-cash write-off resulted from the decision to abandon certain modules of a software platform that were being developed in the U.S. as a result of a change in strategy. This impairment charge was included within operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Other Intangible Assets During the year ended December31, 2012, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $19.8 million in our EMEA segment. This non-cash write-off related to the discontinuation of the use of a trade name in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and was reflected as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries During the year ended December31, 2012, we recorded write-downs of $3.9 million, of which $0.6 million were attributable to non-controlling interests. During the year ended December31, 2012, $3.8 million of the investment write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and $0.1 million were reported in our Development Services segment. These write-downs were primarily driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets and the continuation of challenging market conditions.
During the year ended December31, 2011, we recorded write-downs of $5.6 million, of which $0.1 million were attributable to non-controlling interests. During the year ended December31, 2011, $5.5 million of the investment write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and $0.1 million were reported in our Development Services segment. These write-downs were primarily driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
During the year ended December31, 2010, we recorded write-downs of $11.8 million, of which $3.8 million were attributable to non-controlling interests. During the year ended December31, 2010, $9.4 million of the investments write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets. In addition, during the year ended December31, 2010, we incurred an additional $1.2 million of impairment charges in each of our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments, all driven by a decline in value of several investments attributable to slower than expected leasing.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) All of our impairment charges related to investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries were included in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. When we performed our impairment analysis, the assumptions utilized reflected our outlook for the commercial real estate industry and the expected impact on our business.
Real Estate During the year ended December31, 2012, we recorded impairment charges of $26.5 million on real estate held for investment. Of this amount, $15.9 million was attributable to non-controlling interests. These impairment charges were driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets and the continuation of challenging market conditions.
During the year ended December31, 2011, we recorded charges of $4.3 million, including provisions for losses on real estate held for sale and impairment charges on real estate held for investment. Of this amount, $0.3 million was attributable to non-controlling interests. During the year ended December31, 2011, we recorded provisions for losses on real estate held for sale of $2.6 million. These charges reduced the carrying value of certain assets to their fair value, less cost to sell, primarily due to reduced selling prices resulting from a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets. Additionally, during the year ended December31, 2011, we recorded impairment charges of $1.7 million related to real estate held for investment, which were attributable to continued challenging market conditions.
During the year ended December31, 2010, we recorded charges of $26.9 million, including impairment charges on real estate held for investment and provisions for losses on real estate held for sale. Of this amount, $23.8 million was attributable to non-controlling interests. During the year ended December31, 2010, we recorded impairment charges of $24.6 million related to nine real estate projects primarily due to a decrease in the estimated holding period of several of the projects and continued capital market disruption. Additionally, during the year ended December31, 2010, we recorded provisions for losses on real estate held for sale of $2.3 million to reduce the carrying values of two office buildings, an operating hotel and a land parcel to their fair value less cost to sell, primarily due to reduced expected selling prices resulting from continued challenging market conditions.
All of the abovementioned charges were reported in our Development Services segment, with the exception of a $9.3 million impairment charge reported in our Global Investment Management segment during the year ended December31, 2012. All of the abovementioned charges were included within operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, with the exception of a $1.3 million provision for loss on real estate for the year ended December31, 2011, which was included within activity from discontinued operations. If conditions in the broader economy, commercial real estate industry, specific markets or product types in which we operate worsen, we may be required to evaluate additional projects or re-evaluate previously impaired projects for potential impairment. These evaluations could result in additional impairment charges, which may be material.
Notes Receivable During the year ended December31, 2010 we recorded a $0.3 million impairment charge on a note receivable secured by real estate, due to a decrease in value of the borrowers real estate project, the proceeds from the sale of which would be used to repay the note receivable.

FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our financial instruments, excluding those included in the preceding fair value tables above, are as follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash : These balances include cash and cash equivalents as well as restricted cash with maturities of less than three months. The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
Receivables, less Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Due to their short-term nature, fair value approximates carrying value.
Warehouse Receivables: These balances are carried at fair value based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
Trading and Available for Sale Securities: These investments are carried at their fair value.
Securities Sold, not yet Purchased: These liabilities are carried at their fair value.
Short-Term Borrowings : The majority of this balance represents our warehouse lines of credit and our revolving credit facility outstanding for CBRE Capital Markets. Due to the short-term nature and variable interest rates of these instruments, fair value approximates carrying value (see Note 13).
Senior Secured Term Loans : Based upon information from third-party banks, the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which approximated their actual carrying value at December31, 2012 and 2011 (see Note 13).
Interest Rate Swaps : These liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative (see Note 6).
11.625% Senior Subordinated Notes : Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair value of our 11.625% senior subordinated notes was $488.8 million and $504.3 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Their actual carrying value totaled $440.5 million and $439.0 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively (see Note 13).
6.625% Senior Notes : Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair value of our 6.625% senior notes was $385.0 million and $364.9 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Their actual carrying value totaled $350.0 million at both December31, 2012 and 2011 (see Note 13).
Notes Payable on Real Estate: As of December31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying value of our notes payable on real estate was $326.0 million and $372.9 million, respectively (see Note 12). These borrowings have mostly floating interest rates at spreads over a market rate index. It is likely that some portion of our notes payable on real estate have fair values lower than actual carrying values. Given our volume of notes payable and the cost involved in estimating their fair value, we determined it was not practicable to do so. Additionally, only $13.9 million and $13.6 million of these notes payable were recourse to us as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 6. Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments. Specifically, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings. Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges. The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities. The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. There was no hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, there was $48.0 million and $39.9 million, respectively, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to these interest rate swaps, which will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our senior secured term loan facilities. During the next twelve months, we estimate that $11.7 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.
The following table presents the fair value of our interest rate swaps as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands): Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Balance Sheet Location Fair Value as of December31, 2012 Fair Value as of December31, 2011 Balance Sheet Location Fair Value as of December31, 2012 Fair Value as of December31, 2011 Interestrateswaps Otherassets $  $  Otherliabilities $ 48,022 $ 39,872 The following table presents the effect of our interest rate swaps on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2012 (dollars in thousands): AmountofLoss Recognized in Other Comprehensive LossonDerivative (Effective Portion) LocationofLoss Reclassifiedfrom Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (EffectivePortion) AmountofLoss Reclassifiedfrom Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (EffectivePortion) LocationofLoss RecognizedinIncome on Derivative (Ineffective Portion) AmountofLoss Recognized on Derivative (IneffectivePortion) Interest rate swaps $ (19,826 ) Interestexpense $ (11,676 ) Interestexpense $  99 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.

As of December31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of derivatives related to these agreements was net liability positions of $49.0 million and $40.9 million, respectively, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk. As of December31, 2012, we have not posted any collateral related to these agreements. Had we breached any of the provisions discussed above at December31, 2012, we may have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $51.2million.
From time to time, we also enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate. If any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges, then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings. The net impact on our earnings resulting from gains and/or losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant.
We routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange swap, option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate. In the normal course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans, expected cash flow and earnings. Included in the consolidated statements of operations were net losses of $4.4 million, $1.5 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, resulting from net losses on foreign currency exchange swap, option and forward contracts. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding.
We also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale. Topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives. The net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these derivatives contracts has not been significant.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) During 2012, we completed five in-fill acquisitions, including our former affiliate companies in Turkey and Vietnam, a niche real estate investment advisor and an independent commercial and residential property partnership in the U.K., and a brokerage and property management firm in Atlanta. During 2011, in addition to the REIM Acquisitions, we completed five in-fill acquisitions, including a valuation business in Australia, a retail property management business in central and eastern Europe, our former affiliate company in Switzerland, a retail services business in the U.K. and a shopping center management business in the Netherlands.
Our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year. We performed the 2012, 2011 and 2010 assessments as of October1. When we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of October1, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value. From late 2007 through 2009, the severe global economic downturn and credit market crisis had significant adverse effects on our operations and reduced our revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, and funds available to invest in commercial real estate and related assets. These negative trends began to reverse in early 2010 and commercial real estate markets have improved gradually for the past three years in step with the recovery of global economic activity. Our stock price ($18.65 per share on October1, 2012, $13.46 per share on October1, 2011 and $18.13 per share on October1, 2010, versus $10.94 at October1, 2009 and $4.32 per share at December31, 2008) has also reflected this gradual recovery. These indicators led to a significant increase in the estimated fair value of our reporting units over the past three years.
Other intangible assets totaled $786.8 million and $794.3 million, net of accumulated amortization of $273.6 million and $195.0 million, as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): December31, 2012 2011 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Unamortizable intangible assets Management contracts $ 219,132 $ 216,015 Trademarks 56,800 56,800 Trade names 20,400 40,226 $ 296,332 $ 313,041 Amortizable intangible assets Customer relationships $ 259,256 $ (84,628 ) $ 257,585 $ (66,994 ) Mortgage servicing rights 195,813 (50,858 ) 128,903 (33,560 ) Management contracts 178,561 (32,005 ) 177,219 (14,667 ) Backlog and incentive fees 58,478 (57,739 ) 47,237 (47,237 ) Other 71,984 (48,401 ) 65,322 (32,524 ) $ 764,092 $ (273,631 ) $ 676,266 $ (194,982 ) Total intangible assets $ 1,060,424 $ (273,631 ) $ 989,307 $ (194,982 ) Management contracts with indefinite useful lives primarily represent intangible assets identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions relating to relationships with open-end funds. Trademarks of $56.8 million were separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition. In connection with the REIM Acquisitions, a trade name 102 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) of $20.4 million was separately identified, which represented the Clarion Partners trade name in the U.S. These intangible assets have indefinite useful lives and accordingly are not being amortized. As a result of the Insignia Acquisition, a $19.8 million trade name was separately identified, which represented the Richard Ellis trade name in the U.K. During the year ended December31, 2012, such trade name was written off as a result of the discontinuation of its use (see Note 5). This write-off was included in non-amortizable intangible asset impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Customer relationships primarily represent intangible assets identified in the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition relating to existing relationships primarily in the brokerage, property management, project management and facilities management lines of business. These intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives of up to 20 years.
Mortgage servicing rights represent the fair value of servicing assets in our mortgage brokerage line of business in the U.S. The mortgage servicing rights are being amortized over the useful lives of the underlying loans, which are generally up to ten years.
Management contracts consist primarily of asset management contracts relating to relationships with closed-end funds and separate accounts in the U.S., Europe and Asia that were separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions. Also included in management contracts are property management contracts in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and France, as well as valuation services and fund management contracts in the U.K. These management contracts are being amortized over useful lives of up to 13 years.
Backlog and incentive fees mostly represented the fair value of net revenue backlog and incentive fees acquired as part of the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition as well as other in-fill acquisitions. These intangible assets were amortized over useful lives of up to one year.
Other amortizable intangible assets mainly represent transition costs, non-compete agreements acquired as a result of the REIM Acquisitions and other intangible assets acquired as a result of the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition and the Insignia Acquisition. Other intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives of up to 20 years.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $78.6 million, $41.9 million and $23.1 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The estimated annual amortization expense for each of the years ending December31, 2013 through December31, 2017 approximates $71.8 million, $61.0 million, $56.2 million, $48.0 million and $44.0 million, respectively.

Since 2001, we have maintained credit facilities with Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) and other lenders to fund strategic acquisitions and to provide for our working capital needs. On November10, 2010, we entered into 112 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) a new credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks led by CS, as administrative and collateral agent, to completely refinance our previous credit facilities. On March4, 2011, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase flexibility to various covenants to accommodate the REIM Acquisitions and to maintain the availability of the $800.0 million incremental facility under the Credit Agreement. On March4, 2011, we also entered into an incremental assumption agreement to allow for the establishment of new tranche C and tranche D term loan facilities. On November10, 2011, we entered into an incremental assumption agreement led jointly by HSBC BankUSA,N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to allow for the establishment of a new tranche A-1 term loan facility, which also reduced the $800.0 million incremental facility under the Credit Agreement.
As of December31, 2012, our Credit Agreement provides for the following: (1)a $700.0 million revolving credit facility, including revolving credit loans, letters of credit and a swingline loan facility, maturing on May10, 2015; (2)a $350.0 million tranche A term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on December31, 2010 and continue through September30, 2015, with the balance payable on November10, 2015; (3)a 187.0million (approximately $300.0 million) tranche A-1 term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on December30, 2011 and continue through March31, 2016, with the balance payable on May10, 2016; (4)a $300.0 million tranche B term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on December31, 2010 and continue through September30, 2016, with the balance payable on November10, 2016; (5)a $400.0 million tranche C term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on September30, 2011 and continue through December31, 2017, with the balance payable on March4, 2018; (6)a $400.0 million tranche D term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on September30, 2011 and continue through June30, 2019, with the balance payable on September4, 2019 and (7)an accordion provision which provides the ability to borrow additional funds under an incremental facility. The incremental facility is equivalent to the sum of $800.0 million and the aggregate amount of all repayments of term loans and permanent reductions of revolver commitments under the Credit Agreement. However, at no time may the sum of all outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement exceed $2.95 billion. On November10, 2011, we utilized the incremental facility to issue the tranche A-1 term loan facility.
On June30, 2011, we drew down $400.0million of the tranche D term loan facility to finance the CRES portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on July1, 2011. On August31, 2011, we drew down $400.0 million of the tranche C term loan facility, part of which was used to finance the ING REIM Asia portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on October3, 2011. The remaining borrowings were used to finance the acquisition of ING REIMs operations in Europe, which closed on October31, 2011.
The revolving credit facility allows for borrowings outside of the U.S., with sub-facilities of $5.0 million available to one of our Canadian subsidiaries, $35.0 million in aggregate available to one of our Australian and one of our New Zealand subsidiaries and $50.0 million available to one of our U.K. subsidiaries. Additionally, outstanding borrowings under these sub-facilities may be up to 5.0% higher as allowed under the currency fluctuation provision in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of December31, 2012 bear interest at varying rates, based at our option, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 1.65% to 3.15% or the daily rate plus 0.65% to 2.15% as determined by reference to our ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of December31, 2012 and 2011, we had $73.0 million and $44.8 million, respectively, of revolving credit facility principal outstanding with related weighted average interest rates of 3.2% and 4.3%, respectively, which are included in short-term borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of December31, 2012, letters of credit totaling $16.9 million were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. These letters of credit were primarily issued in the normal course of business as well as in connection with certain insurance programs and reduce the amount we may borrow under the revolving credit facility.

14. Commitments and Contingencies We are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business. Our management believes that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued arising from such lawsuits are remote, but that litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount in excess of that anticipated by management.
Our leases generally relate to office space that we occupy, have varying terms and expire through 2030. The following is a schedule by year of future minimum lease payments for noncancellable operating leases as of December31, 2012 (dollars in thousands): Operatingleases 2013 $ 176,764 2014 155,207 2015 138,669 2016 123,408 2017 106,143 Thereafter 382,934 Total minimum payment required $ 1,083,125 Total minimum payments for noncancellable operating leases were not reduced by the minimum sublease rental income of $5.2 million due in the future under noncancellable subleases.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Substantially all leases require us to pay maintenance costs, insurance and property taxes. The composition of total rental expense under noncancellable operating leases consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December31, 2012 2011 2010 Minimum rentals $ 210,981 $ 209,333 $ 189,190 Less sublease rentals (218 ) (187 ) (184 ) $ 210,763 $ 209,146 $ 189,006 We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $18.8 million as of December31, 2012, excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases.

We had guarantees totaling $27.2 million as of December31, 2012, excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities, consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet, and operating leases. The $27.2 million primarily consists of guarantees related to our defined benefit pension plans in the U.K. (in excess of our outstanding pension liability of $63.5 million as of December31, 2012), which are continuous guarantees that will not expire until all amounts have been paid out for our pension liabilities. The remainder of the guarantees mainly represents guarantees of obligations of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which expire at varying dates through August 2015, as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas, which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.
In addition, as of December31, 2012, we had numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects. These guarantees are made by us in the ordinary course of our Development Services business. Each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget. However, we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees. These contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors. While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees.
In January 2008, CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc.

CBRE MCI has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of $5.8 billion at December31, 2012.Additionally, CBRE MCI has funded loans under the DUS Program that are not subject to loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of approximately $492.6 million at December31, 2012.CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur.As of December31, 2012 and 2011, CBRE MCI had $9.1 million and $4.6 million, respectively, of cash deposited under this reserve arrangement, and had provided approximately $10.6 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of loan loss accruals.

These co-investments typically range from 2.0% to 5.0% of the equity in a particular fund. As of December31, 2012, we had aggregate commitments of $31.7 million to fund future co-investments.

Second Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
Our 2004 stock incentive plan was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders on April21, 2004, and was amended several times subsequently, including an amendment and restatement on June2, 2008 and an amendment on December3, 2008.However, our 2004 stock incentive plan was terminated in May 2012 in connection with the adoption of our 2012 equity incentive plan, which is described below. At termination, all unissued shares from the 2004 stock incentive plan were allocated to the 2012 equity incentive plan for potential future issuance. The 2004 stock incentive plan authorized the grant of stock-based awards to our employees, directors or independent contractors.A total of 20,785,218 shares of our ClassA common stock initially were reserved for issuance under the 2004 stock incentive plan, which increased by 10,000,000 shares to a total of 30,785,218 shares in connection with the June2, 2008 amendment and restatement.For awards granted prior to June2, 2008 under this plan, this share reserve was reduced by one share upon grant of an option or stock appreciation right, and was reduced by 2.25 shares upon issuance of stock pursuant to other stock-based awards.For awards granted on or after June2, 2008 under this plan, this share reserve was reduced by one share upon grant of all awards.In addition, full value awards, i.e., awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights, were limited to no more than 75% of the total share reserve.No person was eligible to be granted awards in the aggregate covering more than 2,000,000 shares during any fiscal year.The number of shares issued or reserved pursuant to the 2004 stock incentive plan, or pursuant to outstanding awards, was subject to adjustment on account of mergers, consolidations, reorganizations, stock splits, stock dividends and other dilutive changes in our common stock.In 119 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) addition, our board of directors could adjust outstanding awards to preserve the awards benefits or potential benefits. Since our 2004 stock incentive plan has been terminated, no new awards may be granted under it. However, as of December31, 2012, outstanding stock options granted under the 2004 stock incentive plan to acquire 1,432,754 shares of our ClassA common stock remain outstanding according to their terms, and we will continue to issue shares to the extent required under the terms of such outstanding awards. Shares underlying awards that expire, terminate or lapse under the 2004 stock incentive plan will become available for grant under the 2012 equity incentive plan.
2012 Equity Incentive Plan.
Our 2012 equity incentive plan was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders on May8, 2012. The 2012 equity incentive plan authorizes the grant of stock-based awards to our employees, directors or independent contractors.Unless terminated earlier, the 2012 equity incentive plan will terminate on February13, 2022.A total of 16,000,000 shares of our ClassA common stock plus 2,205,887 unissued shares that remained under the 2004 stock incentive plan were reserved for issuance under the 2012 equity incentive plan.Additionally, shares underlying awards that expire, terminate or lapse under the 2012 equity incentive plan or under the 2004 stock incentive plan will become available for issuance under the 2012 equity incentive plan.No person is eligible to be granted performance-based awards in the aggregate covering more than 3,300,000 shares during any fiscal year or cash awards in excess of $5,000,000 for any fiscal year.The number of shares issued or reserved pursuant to the 2012 equity incentive plan, or pursuant to outstanding awards, is subject to adjustment on account of a stock split of our outstanding shares, stock dividend, dividend payable in a form other than shares in an amount that has a material effect on the price of the shares, consolidation, combination or reclassification of the shares, recapitalization, spin-off, or other similar occurrence.Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2012 equity incentive plan are subject to a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant. Restricted share and restricted stock unit awards that have only time-based service vesting conditions are generally subject to a minimum three year vesting schedule. Restricted share and restricted stock unit awards that have performance-based vesting conditions are generally subject to a minimum one year vesting schedule. As of December31, 2012, 16,393,350 shares remained available for future grants under this plan.
Stock Options As of December31, 2012, no shares were subject to options issued under our 2012 equity incentive plan. No options were granted during the year ended December31, 2012. Options granted under the 2004 stock incentive plan during the year ended December31, 2011 have an exercise price of $26.50 and during the year ended December31, 2010 have exercise prices in the range of $14.88 to $16.48, all of which vest and are exercisable in equal quarterly increments over three years from the date of grant. All options that have been granted under the 2004 stock incentive plan have a term of five or seven years from the date of grant.

We estimate the fair value of our options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which takes into account assumptions such as the dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate, the expected stock price volatility and the expected life of the options.
The total estimated grant date fair value of stock options that vested during the year ended December31, 2012 was $3.1 million. The weighted average fair value of options granted by us was $13.49 and $10.40 for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, utilizing the following weighted average assumptions: YearEndedDecember31, 2011 2010 Dividend yield 0 % 0 % Risk-free interest rate 1.65 % 2.31 % Expected volatility 61.99 % 75.37 % Expected life 5years 6years The dividend yield assumption is excluded from the calculation, as it is our present intention to retain all earnings. The expected volatility is based on a combination of our historical stock price and implied volatility. The selection of implied volatility data to estimate expected volatility is based upon the availability of actively 121 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) traded options on our stock. The risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the options. The expected life of our stock options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar options, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.
Option valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility and expected life. Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, we do not believe that the Black-Scholes model necessarily provides a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options.

Total compensation expense related to stock options was $2.4 million, $3.5 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December31, 2012, total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock options was approximately $0.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.8 years.
The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $16.4 million, $39.9 million and $14.5 million, respectively. We recorded cash received from stock option exercises of $20.3 million, $7.1 million and $2.4 million and related tax benefit of $2.9 million, $14.9 million and $5.4 million during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Upon option exercise, we issue new shares of stock. Excess tax benefits exist when the tax deduction resulting from the exercise of options exceeds the compensation cost recorded.
Non-Vested Stock Awards We have issued non-vested stock awards, including restricted stock units and restricted shares, in our ClassA common stock to certain of our employees and members of our board of directors. During the year ended December31, 2012, we granted 2,353,487 of non-vested stock units which primarily vest and are exercisable generally in equal annual increments over four years from the date of grant. We granted 644,635 and 759,992 of 122 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.

At December31, 2012, total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock awards was approximately $106.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.9 years.
Bonuses.
We have bonus programs covering select employees, including senior management. Awards are based on the position and performance of the employee and the achievement of pre-established financial, operating and strategic objectives. The amounts charged to expense for bonuses were $134.5 million, $154.4 million and $135.0 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
401(k) Plan.
Our CBRE 401(k) Plan (401(k)Plan) is a defined contribution savings plan that allows participant deferrals under Section401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Most of our non-union U.S. employees, other than qualified real estate agents having the status of independent contractors under section 3508 of the Internal Revenue Code, are eligible to participate in the plan. The 401(k) Plan provides for participant contributions as well as a Company match. A participant is allowed to contribute to the 401(k) Plan from 1% to 75% of his or her compensation, subject to limits imposed by applicable law. Effective January1, 2007, all participants hired post January1, 2007 vest in company match contributions 20%per year for each plan year they work 1,000 hours. All participants hired before January1, 2007 are immediately vested in company match contributions. The Company match was suspended in 2010 due to adverse economic conditions. However, we made a partial retroactive match for 2010 401(k) participants who were employed at December31, 2010, which was included in the $2.7 million expense for the year ended December31, 2010. As of January1, 2011, the Company match was reinstated. For 2011 and 2012, we contributed a 50% match on the first 3% of annual compensation (up to $150,000 of compensation) deferred by each participant. In connection with the 401(k) Plan, we charged to expense $12.9 million, $10.9 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

As of December31, 2012, approximately 1.3million shares of our common stock were held as investments by participants in our 401(k) Plan.
Pension Plans.
We have two contributory defined benefit pension plans in the U.K. The London-based firm of Hillier Parker May& Rowden, which we acquired in 1998, had a contributory defined benefit pension plan. A subsidiary of Insignia, which we acquired in connection with the Insignia Acquisition in 2003, also had a contributory defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. Our subsidiaries based in the U.K. maintain the plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in these plans. With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations. Effective July1, 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits. In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in a defined contribution plan.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, plans funded status and amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for both of our defined benefit pension plans (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December31, 2012 2011 Change in benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of period $ 316,165 $ 296,577 Interest cost 15,513 16,556 Actuarial loss 14,447 12,115 Benefits paid (8,768 ) (7,697 ) Foreign currency translation 14,885 (1,386 ) Benefit obligation at end of period $ 352,242 $ 316,165 Change in plan assets Fair value of plan asset at beginning of period $ 255,305 $ 256,570 Actuarial return on plan assets 24,175 1,649 Company contributions 5,886 5,332 Benefits paid (8,768 ) (7,697 ) Foreign currency translation 12,116 (549 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of period $ 288,714 $ 255,305 Funded status $ (63,528 ) $ (60,860 ) Amounts recognized in the statement of financial position consist of: Non-current liabilities $ (63,528 ) $ (60,860 ) The accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $352.2 million and $316.2 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The corporate bond yield curve is derived by taking a government bond yield curve, based on Bank of England data and adding an amount to reflect the yield spread on AA-rated bonds over government bonds. This discount rate selected is the weighted average of the yields on the resulting bond yield curve, where the weighting is based on the expected cash flow from the weighted average duration of the pension plans.
We review historical rates of return for equity and fixed income securities, as well as current economic conditions, to determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The assumed rate of return for 2012 is based on 66.7% of the portfolio being invested in equities yielding a 6.8% return and 22.7% of assets being primarily invested in corporate and government debt securities yielding a 3.9% return. Consideration is given to diversification and periodic rebalancing of the portfolio based on prevailing market conditions.

As of December31, 2012, there were also deferred tax assets before valuation allowances of approximately $6.8 million related to state NOLs as well as $33.4 million related to foreign NOLs. The state and foreign NOLs both begin to expire in 2013. The utilization of NOLs may be subject to certain limitations under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws.
In addition, as of December 31, 2012, we had $84.9 million of foreign income tax credits that can be utilized to offset U.S. federal income taxes on foreign-sourced earnings. These credits will begin to expire in 2022.
Management determined that as of December31, 2012, $76.2 million of deferred tax assets do not satisfy the recognition criteria set forth in Topic 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for this amount. If released, the entire amount would result in a benefit to continuing operations. During the year ended December31, 2012, our valuation allowance increased by approximately $38.5 million. This was primarily the result of the establishment of valuation allowances of $40.4 million related to U.S. foreign tax credits, $6.4million related to non-U.S. net operating losses and other assets, $2.0 million related to other U.S. assets and $1.6million related to foreign net operating loss adjustments. These increases were partially offset by the utilization of $11.9 million of non-U.S. net operating losses and other foreign assets. Management believes it is more likely than not that future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded net of these valuation allowances.
During 2012, we identified opportunities to repatriate $191.0 million to the U.S., $58.0 million in 2012 and $133.0 million in 2013, which resulted in $28.8million of tax benefit in 2012. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability for $1.1billion of remaining undistributed earnings of subsidiaries located outside of the U.S. Although tax liabilities might result from the payment of dividends out of such earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-U.S. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and we do not have any plans to repatriate these earnings or to sell or liquidate any of these non-U.S. subsidiaries. To the extent 129 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) that we are able to repatriate the unremitted earnings in a tax efficient manner, or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy in which such funds become needed for funding our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits. The determination of the tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable. Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $263.4 million at December31, 2012.
The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $95.6 million and $91.7 million as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is $51.5 million ($49.4 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) and $43.0 million ($41.8 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011 is as follows (dollars in thousands): YearEndedDecember31, 2012 2011 Beginning balance, unrecognized tax benefits $ (91,710 ) $ (77,177 ) Gross increasestax positions in prior period (3,092 ) (9,798 ) Gross decreasestax positions in prior period 5,306 184 Gross increasescurrent-period tax positions (5,432 ) (5,616 ) Decreases relating to settlements 35 721 Reductions as a result of lapse of statute of limitations 189 154 Foreign exchange movement (871 ) (178 ) Ending balance, unrecognized tax benefits $ (95,575 ) $ (91,710 ) We believe it is reasonably possible that between $24.6 million and $68.7 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits will be settled during the next twelve months due to filing amended returns and the conclusion of an advanced pricing agreement.
Our continuing practice is to recognize potential accrued interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters within income tax expense. During the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we accrued an additional $3.3 million, $3.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in interest associated with uncertain tax positions. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, we have recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $30.4 million ($24.1 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense) and $27.1 million ($21.8 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense), respectively.
We conduct business globally and, as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal Internal Revenue Service audits for years prior to 2005. With limited exception, our significant state and foreign tax jurisdictions are no longer subject to audit by the various tax authorities for tax years prior to 2005.

Stockholders Equity Our board of directors is authorized, subject to any limitations imposed by law, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue a total of 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with each such series having rights and preferences including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as our board of directors may determine.

Our management believes EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. As a result, our management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs. Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined 133 Table of Contents CBRE GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our managements discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.

Item9A. Controls and Procedures Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), including maintenance of (i)records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, and (ii)policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that (a)transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (b)our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors and (c)we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls. As a result of such limitations, there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the COSO framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2012. The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our policy for disclosure controls and procedures provides guidance on the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosure is complete and accurate in all material respects and that all information required to be disclosed in the periodic reports submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Our Disclosure Committee consisting of the principal accounting officer, general counsel, chief communication officer, senior officers of each significant business line and other select employees assisted the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer in this evaluation. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as required by the Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
