PART I Item 1. Business Company Overview Organization.
CBRE Holding,Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated on February20, 2001 as Blum CB Holding Corporation. On March26, 2001, Blum CB Holding Corporation changed its name to CBRE Holding,Inc. (the Company). The Company and its former wholly owned subsidiary, Blum CB Corporation (Blum CB), a Delaware corporation, were created to acquire all of the outstanding shares of CB Richard Ellis Services,Inc. (CBRE), an international real estate services firm. Prior to July20, 2001, the Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Blum Strategic Partners, LP (Blum Strategic), formerly known as RCBA Strategic Partners, LP, which is an affiliate of Richard C. Blum, a director of the Company and CBRE.
On July20, 2001, the Company acquired CBRE (the 2001 Merger) pursuant to an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May31, 2001, among the Company, CBRE and Blum CB. Blum CB was merged with and into CBRE, with CBRE being the surviving corporation. The operations of the Company after the 2001 Merger are substantially the same as the operations of CBRE prior to the 2001 Merger. In addition, the Company has no substantive operations other than its investment in CBRE. Information regarding the 2001 Merger is included in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and within Note3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Nature of Operations.
CBRE Holding,Inc. is a holding company that conducts its operations primarily through direct and indirect operating subsidiaries. In the United States (US), the Company operates through CB Richard Ellis,Inc. and L.J. Melody, in the United Kingdom (UK) through CB Hillier Parker and in Canada through CB Richard Ellis Limited. CB Richard Ellis Investors, LLC (CBRE Investors) and its foreign affiliates conduct business in the US, Europe and Asia. The Company operates in 47 countries through various subsidiaries and pursuant to cooperation agreements. Approximately 73% of the Company's revenue is generated from the US and 27% is generated from the rest of the world. See Note21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial data relating to the Company's domestic and foreign operations, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Recent Developments On February17, 2003, the Company, CBRE, Apple Acquisition Corp. (the Merger Sub) and Insignia Financial Group,Inc. (Insignia) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Insignia Acquisition Agreement). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Insignia Acquisition Agreement, the Merger Sub will merge with and into Insignia, the separate existence of the Merger Sub will cease and Insignia will continue its existence as a wholly owned subsidiary of CBRE (the Insignia Acquisition).
When the Insignia Acquisition becomes effective, each outstanding share of common stock of Insignia (other than the cancelled shares, dissenting shares and shares held by wholly owned subsidiaries of Insignia) will be converted into the right to receive $11.00 in cash, without interest, from the Merger Sub, subject to adjustments as provided in the Insignia Acquisition Agreement. At the same time, each outstanding share of common stock of the Merger Sub will be converted into one share of common stock of the surviving entity in the Insignia Acquisition.
As of February17, 2003, the the transaction was valued at approximately $415.0million, including the repayment of net debt and the redemption of preferred stock. In addition to Insignia shareholder approval, the transaction, which is expected to close in June2003, is subject to the receipt of financing and regulatory approvals. The sale by Insignia on March14, 2003 of its residential real estate services 1 subsidiaries, Insignia Douglas Elliman LLC and Insignia Residential Group, Inc., to Montauk Battery Realty, LLC and Insignia's receipt of the cash proceeds from such sale will not affect the consideration to be paid in the Insignia Acquisition.
Business Segments In the third quarter of 2001, subsequent to the 2001 Merger transaction, the Company reorganized its business segments as part of its efforts to reduce costs and streamline its operations. The Company reports its operations through three geographically organized segments: (1)Americas, (2)Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and (3)Asia Pacific. The Americas consists of operations located in the US, Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America. EMEA mainly consists of operations in Europe, while Asia Pacific includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Previously, the Company operated and reported its segments based on the applicable type of revenue transaction.
Information regarding revenue and operating income or loss attributable to each of the Company's business segments is included in "Segment Operations" within the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section and within Note21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference. Information concerning the identifiable assets of each of the Company's business segments is set forth in Note21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Americas The Americas is the largest business segment in terms of revenue, earnings and cash flow. It includes the following major lines of businesses:  The Brokerage Services line of business provides sales, leasing and consulting services relating to commercial real estate. This line of business is built upon relationships that the Company establishes with clients. This business does not require significant capital expenditures on a recurring basis. However, due to the low barriers to entry and strong competition, the Company strives to retain top producers through an attractive compensation program that motivates its sales force to achieve higher revenue production. Therefore, the most significant cost is commission expense. In addition, the Company believes that the CB Richard Ellis brand provides it with a competitive operating advantage. This line of business employs approximately 2,120 individuals in offices located in most of the largest metropolitan areas in the US and approximately 410 individuals in Canada and Latin America.
The Investment Properties line of business provides similar brokerage services primarily for commercial, multi-housing and hotel real estate property marketed for sale to institutional and private investors. This line of business employs approximately 480 individuals in offices mainly located in North America.
The Corporate Services line of business focuses on building relationships with large corporate clients. The objective is to establish long-term relationships with clients that could benefit from utilizing Corporate Services' broad array of services and/or global presence. These clients are offered the opportunity to be relieved of the responsibility of managing their commercial real estate activities at a lower cost than they could achieve by managing these activities themselves. Corporate Services includes research and consulting, structured finance, project management, lease administration and transaction management. These services can be delivered on a bundled or unbundled basis involving other lines of business in single or multiple markets. This business line employs approximately 420 individuals, primarily within North America.
The Commercial Mortgage line of business provides commercial loan origination and loan servicing through the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, L.J. Melody. The Commercial 2 Mortgage business line focuses on the origination of commercial mortgages without incurring principal risk. As part of its activities, L.J. Melody has established correspondent relationships and conduit arrangements with investment banking firms, national banks, credit companies, insurance companies, pension funds and government agencies. Additionally, L.J. Melody participates in a partnership whereby costs are shared in the servicing of its loan portfolios, which allows for significant cost savings. This business line employs approximately 325 individuals in the US.
The Valuation line of business provides valuation, appraisal and market research services. These services include market value appraisals, litigation support, discounted cash flow analyses, and feasibility and fairness opinions. The Company believes that the valuation business line is one of the largest in its industry domestically. At December31, 2002, this business line had over 200 employees on staff in the Americas. It has developed proprietary technology for preparing and delivering valuation reports to its clients, which provides a competitive advantage over its rivals.
The Investment Management line of business provides investment management services through the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, CBRE Investors. CBRE Investors' clients include pension plans, investment funds, insurance companies and other organizations seeking to generate returns and diversification through investment in real estate. CBRE Investors sponsors funds and investment programs that span the risk/return spectrum. In higher yield strategies, CBRE Investors "co-invests" with its clients/partners. These co-investments typically range from 2% to 5% of the equity in a particular fund. CBRE Investors is organized into three general client focused groups according to investment strategy, which include: Managed Accounts (low risk), Strategic Partners (value added funds) and Special Situations (higher yield and highly focused strategies). Operationally, a dedicated investment team with the requisite skill sets and location executes each investment strategy. Each team's compensation is driven largely by the investment performance of its particular strategy/fund. This organizational structure is designed to align the interests of team members with those of the firm and its investor clients/partners and to enhance accountability and performance. Dedicated teams share resources such as accounting, financial controls, information technology, investor services and research. In addition to the research within the CB Richard Ellis platform, which focuses primarily on market conditions and forecasts, CBRE Investors has an in-house team of research professionals who focus on investment strategy and underwriting. CBRE Investors has approximately 110 employees located in its Los Angeles headquarters and in a regional office in Boston.
The Asset Services line of business provides value-added asset and related services for income-producing properties owned by local, regional and institutional investors. At December31, 2002, it managed approximately 216.8million square feet of commercial space in the Americas. Asset Services includes property management, construction management, marketing, leasing, and accounting and financial services for investor-owned properties, including office, industrial and retail properties. Asset Services markets its services primarily to long-term institutional owners of large commercial real estate assets. Asset Services' contractual relationships put the Company in a position to provide other services for the owner, including refinancing, appraisal, and lease and sales brokerage services. Asset Services employs more than 1,010 individuals in the US, Canada and Latin America, part of whose compensation is reimbursed by clients. Most asset services are performed by management teams located on-site or in the vicinity of the properties they manage. This provides property owners and tenants with immediate and easily accessible service, enhancing client awareness of manager accountability. All personnel are trained and encouraged to continue their education through both internally-sponsored and outside training. Asset Services personnel utilize state-of-the-art technology to deliver marketing, operations and accounting services.
3  The Facilities Management line of business specializes in the administration, management, maintenance and project management of properties that are occupied by large corporations and institutions. At December31, 2002, Facilities Management had approximately 113.1million square feet under management in the Americas, comprised of corporate headquarters, regional offices, administrative offices and manufacturing and distribution facilities. The Facilities Management business line employs over 820 individuals in the Americas, most of whose compensation is reimbursed by clients. In addition to providing a full range of corporate services through contractual relationships, the Facilities Management group responds to client requests generated by the Company's other business lines for significant, single-assignment acquisition, disposition and strategic real estate consulting assignments that may lead to long-term relationships.
EMEA The EMEA division has 44 offices located in 27 countries, with its largest operations located in the UK, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Germany. Operations within the various countries typically provide, at a minimum, the following services: Brokerage, Investment Properties, Corporate Services, Valuation/Appraisal Services, Asset Services and Facilities Management, with approximately 83.7million square feet under management. Certain countries also provide Financial and Investment Management services. These services are provided to a wide range of clients and cover office, retail, leisure, industrial, logistics, biotechnology, telecommunications and residential property assets.
The Company, operating as CB Hillier Parker in the UK, is one of the leading real estate services companies in that country. It provides a range of commercial property real estate services to investment, commercial and corporate clients located in London. The Company also has four regional offices in Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow. In France, the Company is a key market leader in Paris and provides a complete range of services to the commercial property sector, as well as some services to the residential property market. In Spain, the Company provides extensive coverage operating through its offices in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Malaga, Marbella and Palma de Mallorca. The Company's Netherlands business is based in Amsterdam, while its German operations are located in Frankfurt, Munich, Berlin and Hamburg. The Company's operations in these countries generally provide a full range of services to the commercial property sector, along with some residential property services. As of December31, 2002, there were over 1,300 professional and support staff employed, of which approximately 700 were in the UK.
Asia Pacific The Asia Pacific division has 26 offices located in 11 countries. The Company believes it is one of only a few companies that can provide a full range of real estate services to large corporations throughout the region, including: Brokerage, Investment Management (in Japan only), Corporate Services, Valuation/Appraisal Services, Asset Services and Facilities Management, with approximately 140.0million square feet under management. The CB Richard Ellis brand name is recognized throughout this region as one of the leading worldwide commercial real estate services firms. This division employs over 2,000 individuals. In Asia, the Company's principal operations are located in China (including Hong Kong), Singapore, South Korea and Japan. The Pacific region includes Australia and New Zealand with principal offices located in Auckland, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.
Competitive Strengths The market for the Company's commercial real estate business is both highly fragmented and competitive. Thousands of local commercial real estate brokerage firms and hundreds of regional commercial real estate brokerage firms have offices throughout the world. Most of the Company's competitors in the Brokerage and Asset Services lines of business are local or regional firms that are 4 substantially smaller than the Company on an overall basis, but in some cases may be larger locally. In addition, there are several national, and in some cases international, real estate brokerage firms with whom the Company competes. The Company believes it has a variety of competitive advantages that have helped to establish its strong, global leadership position within the commercial real estate industry. These advantages include the following: Global Brand Name and Presence.
The Company is of the largest commercial real estate services providers in the world in terms of revenue and, together with its predecessors, has been in existence for 97 years. The Company operates over 200 offices in 47 countries around the world. The Company believes that it is among the leading commercial real estate services firms in several major US markets including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth and Phoenix as well as in many other important real estate markets around the world including Hong Kong, London and Paris. The Company's extensive global reach combined with its localized knowledge enables it to provide world-class service to its numerous multi-regional and multi-national clients. Furthermore, as a result of its global brand recognition and geographic reach, the Company believes that large corporations, institutional owners and users of real estate recognize it as the pre-eminent provider of high quality, professional, multi-functional real estate services.
Market Leader and Full Service Provider.
The Company provides a full range of real estate services to meet the needs of its clients. These services include commercial real estate Brokerage Services, Investment Properties, Corporate Services, Mortgage Banking, Investment Management, Valuation and Appraisal Services, Real Estate Market Research, Asset Services and Facilities Management. The Company believes that its combination of significant local market presence, strong client relationships and its scalable, diversified line of business platforms differentiates it from its competitors and provides it with a competitive advantage.
Strong Relationships with Established Customers.
The Company has long-standing relationships with a number of major real estate investors, and its broad national and international presence has enabled it to develop extensive relationships with many leading corporations.
Recurring Revenue Stream.
The Company believes it is well positioned to generate recurring revenue through the turnover of leases and properties for which it has previously acted as transaction manager. The Company's years of strong local market presence have allowed it to develop significant repeat client relationships, which are responsible for a large part of its business.
Attractive Business Model.
The Company's business model features a diversified revenue base, a variable cost structure and low capital requirements.
Diversified Revenue Base.
The Company's global operations, multiple service lines and extensive customer relationships provide it with a diversified revenue base. Approximately 27% of the Company's 2002 revenue was generated outside the US while over 25% of its 2002 revenue was generated from its non-brokerage businesses.
Variable Cost Structure.
The Company's sales and leasing producers are generally paid on a commission and bonus basis, which correlates with the Company's revenue performance. This flexible cost structure allows the Company to maintain its operating margins in a variety of economic conditions.
Low Capital Requirements.
The Company's business model is structured to provide high value added services with low capital intensity. In 2002, the Company's capital expenditures remained low at approximately 1.4% of 2002 revenue.
Empowered Resources.
The Company's proprietary data network gives its professionals instant access to local and global market knowledge to meet its clients' needs. It also enables the Company's 5 professionals to build cross-functional teams to work collaboratively on projects. With real-time access to state-of-the-art information systems, its professionals are empowered to support clients in achieving their business goals.
Strong Senior Management with a Significant Equity Stake.
The Company's senior management team consists of a number of highly respected executives, most of whom have over 20 years of broad experience in the real estate industry. The Company's senior management team beneficially owns approximately 5% of the Company's outstanding common stock.
L.J. Melody competes in the US with a large number of mortgage banking firms and institutional lenders as well as regional and national investment banking firms and insurance companies in providing its mortgage banking services. Appraisal and valuation services are provided by other international, national, regional and local appraisal firms and some international, national and regional accounting firms. CBRE Investors has numerous competitors including other real estate investment managers and investment banks.
The Company's Asset Services and Facilities Management lines of business compete for the right to manage properties controlled by third parties. The competitor may be the owner of the property who is trying to decide upon the efficiency of outsourcing or another management services company. Increasing competition in recent years has resulted in increased pressure to provide additional services at lower rates. The Company has mitigated that pressure by reducing the cost of delivery through automation and by providing services that generate premium fees. One way the Company seeks to grow the Asset Services and Facilities Management lines of business is through assignments that provide synergies with the Company's other lines of business.
Risk Factors The success of the Company's business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, its business could be harmed in the event of an economic slowdown or recession.
During 2002, the Company continued to be adversely affected by the slowdown in the global economy, which negatively impacted the commercial real estate market. This caused a decline in leasing activities within the US, which was partially offset by improved overall revenues in Europe and Asia.
Moreover, in part because of the terrorist attacks on September11, 2001 and the subsequent outbreak of hostilities as well as the conflict with Iraq and the risk of conflict with North Korea, the economic climate in the US and abroad remains uncertain, which may have a further adverse effect on commercial real estate market conditions and, in turn, the Company's operating results.
Periods of economic slowdown or recession in the US and in other countries, rising interest rates, a declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, can harm many segments of the Company's business. These economic conditions could result in a general decline in rents, which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales and leases. In addition, these conditions could lead to a decline in sales prices as well as a decline in demand for funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets. An economic downturn or a significant increase in interest rates also may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by the commercial mortgage banking business. If the brokerage and mortgage banking businesses are negatively impacted, it is likely that the other lines of business would also suffer due to the relationship among the various business lines. Further, as a result of the Company's debt level and the terms of the debt instruments entered into in connection with the 2001 Merger and related transactions, the Company's exposure to adverse general economic conditions is heightened.
6 If the properties that the Company manages fail to perform, its financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.
The revenue the Company generates from its Asset Services and Facilities Management lines of business is generally a percentage of aggregate rent collections from properties, although many management agreements provide for a specified minimum management fee. Accordingly, the Company's success partially depends upon the performance of the properties it manages. The performance of these properties will depend upon the following factors, among others, many of which are partially or completely outside of the Company's control:  the Company's ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants;  the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases;  the Company's ability to control operating expenses;  governmental regulations, local rent control or stabilization ordinances which are in, or may be put into, effect;  various uninsurable risks;  financial conditions prevailing generally and in the areas in which these properties are located;  the nature and extent of competitive properties; and  the real estate market generally.
The Company's growth has depended significantly upon acquisitions, which may not be available in the future and may not perform as the Company expected.
A significant component of the Company's growth has occurred through acquisitions. Any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions. However, future acquisitions may not be available at advantageous prices or upon favorable terms and conditions. In addition, acquisitions involve the risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect.
The Company has had, and may continue to experience, difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies. These difficulties include the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of its key employees or those of the acquired operations. The Company believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income. In addition, the Company generally believes that there will be significant costs related to integrating information technology, accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to effectively manage acquired businesses and some acquisitions may not have an overall benefit.
The Company has several different accounting systems as a result of acquisitions it has made. If the Company is unable to fully integrate the accounting and other systems of the businesses it owns, it may not be able to effectively manage its acquired businesses. Moreover, the integration process itself may be disruptive to business, as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems.
The Company's substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm its ability to operate the business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on the outstanding debt.
The Company is highly leveraged and has significant debt service obligations. For the year ended December31, 2002, the Company's interest expense was $60.5million. The Company's substantial level 7 of indebtedness increases the possibility that it may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of its indebtedness. In addition, the Company may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing its indebtedness. If the Company incurs additional debt, the risks associated with its substantial leverage, including its ability to service its debt, would increase.
The Company's substantial debt could have other important consequences, which include but are not limited to the following:  The Company could be required to use a substantial portion, if not all, of its free cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on its debt; additionally, its level of debt may restrict it from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other general corporate requirements.
The interest expense of the Company could increase if interest rates increase because all of its debt under its Senior Credit Facility, including $221.0million in term loans and a revolving credit facility of up to $90.0million, bear interest at floating rates, generally between three-month LIBOR plus 3.25% and three-month LIBOR plus 3.75% or between the Alternate Base Rate (ABR) plus 2.25% and ABR plus 2.75%. The ABR is the higher of (1)Credit Suisse First Boston's prime rate or (2)the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus one-half of one percent.
The Company's substantial leverage could increase its vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions placing it at a disadvantage compared to those of its competitors that are less leveraged.
The Company's debt service obligations could limit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and in the real estate services industry.
The Company's failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the documents governing its indebtedness, which, among others, require it to maintain specified financial ratios and limit its ability to incur additional debt and sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could harm its business or prospects and could result in its filing for bankruptcy.
The Company cannot be certain that its earnings will be sufficient to allow it to pay principal and interest on its debt and meet its other obligations. If the Company does not have sufficient earnings, it may be required to refinance all or part of its existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell more securities, none of which the Company can guarantee it will be able to do.
The Company has numerous significant competitors, some of which may have greater financial resources than it does.
The Company competes across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry, including investment management, tenant representation, corporate services, construction and development management, property management, agency leasing, valuation and mortgage banking. In general, with respect to each of its business disciplines, the Company cannot assure that it will be able to continue to compete effectively, maintain its current fee arrangements or margin levels, or not encounter increased competition. Each of the business disciplines in which it competes is highly competitive on an international, national, regional and local level. Although the Company is one of the largest real estate services firms in the world in terms of revenue, its relative competitive position varies significantly across product and service categories and geographic areas. Depending on the product or service, the Company faces competition from other real estate service providers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers and accounting firms. Many of its competitors are local or regional firms, which are substantially smaller than the Company; however, 8 they may be substantially larger on a local or regional basis. The Company is also subject to competition from other large national and multi-national firms.
The Company's international operations subject it to social, political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries.
The Company conducts a portion of its business and employs a substantial number of employees outside the US. In 2002, the Company generated approximately 27% of its revenue from operations outside the US. Circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect its business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;  currency restrictions, which may prevent the transfer of capital and profits to the US;  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  potentially adverse tax consequences;  the responsibility of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws;  the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability;  the geographic, time zone, language and cultural differences among personnel in different areas of the world;  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable in some geographic regions such as Asia, where many countries have underdeveloped insolvency laws and clients often are slow to pay, and in some European countries, where clients also tend to delay payments;  political instability; and  foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries such as China.
The Company has committed additional resources to expand its worldwide sales and marketing activities, to globalize its service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels. If the Company is unable to successfully implement these plans, to maintain adequate long-term strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with its global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.
In addition, the Company's international operations and, specifically, the ability of its non-US subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among its subsidiaries (including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on its senior notes) may be affected by currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences, among other things.
The Company's revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations.
The Company's revenue from non-US operations has been primarily denominated in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned. During its fiscal year ended December31, 2002, approximately 27% of its business was transacted in currencies of foreign countries, the majority of which included the Euro, the British Pound Sterling, the Hong Kong dollar, the Singapore dollar and the Australian dollar. Thus, the Company may experience significant fluctuations in revenues and earnings because of corresponding fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company has made significant acquisitions of non-US companies and may acquire additional foreign companies in the future. As the Company increases its foreign operations, fluctuations in the value of the US dollar relative to the other currencies in which the Company may generate earnings 9 could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which the Company is subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, it cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the US dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of the Company's reported results of operations.
From time to time, the Company's management uses currency hedging instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currency. Economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates, which impact cash flow relative to paying down debt and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position. These hedging activities may also not be effective.
A significant portion of the Company's operations are concentrated in California and its business could be harmed if the economic downturn continues in the California real estate market.
For the year ended December31, 2002, approximately $215.3million, or 29%, of the $745.8million in total sales and lease revenue, including revenue from investment property sales, was generated from transactions originating in the State of California. As a result of the geographic concentration in California, a continuation of the economic downturn in the California commercial real estate markets and in the local economies in San Diego, Los Angeles or Orange County could further harm the results of operations.
The Company's co-investment activities subject it to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow.
An important part of the strategy for the investment management business involves investing the Company's capital in certain real estate investments with its clients. As of December31, 2002, the Company had committed an additional $22.6million to fund future co-investments. Participation in real estate transactions through co-investment activity could increase fluctuations in earnings and cash flow. Other risks associated with these activities include, but are not limited to, the following:  loss from investments;  difficulties associated with international co-investments described in "The Company's international operations subject it to social, political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries" and "The Company's revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations"; and  potential lack of control over the disposition of any co-investments and the timing of the recognition of gains, losses or potential incentive participation fees.
The Company may incur liabilities related to its subsidiaries being general partners of numerous general and limited partnerships.
The Company has subsidiaries that are general partners in numerous general and limited partnerships that invest in or manage real estate assets in connection with its co-investments, including several partnerships involved in the acquisition, rehabilitation, subdivision and sale of multi-tenant industrial business parks. Any subsidiary that is a general partner is potentially liable to its partners and for the obligations of the partnership, including those obligations related to environmental contamination of properties owned or managed by the partnership. If the Company's exposure as a general partner is not limited, or if the exposure as a general partner expands in the future, any resulting losses may harm the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
10 The Company's joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of its control, which if realized, could harm its business.
The Company has utilized joint ventures for large commercial investments, initiatives in Internet-related technology and local brokerage partnerships. In the future, the Company may acquire interests in additional general and limited partnerships and other joint ventures formed to own or develop real property or interests in real property. The Company has acquired and may continue to acquire minority interests in joint ventures. Additionally, it may also acquire interests as a passive investor without rights to actively participate in management of the joint ventures. Investments in joint ventures involve additional risks, including, but not limited to, the following:  the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the Company's; and  the Company may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to the Company's instructions or requests and against the Company's policies and objectives.
If a joint venture participant acts contrary to the Company's interest, it could harm the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.
The Company's success depends upon the retention of its senior management, as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees.
The Company's continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of its executive officers and key employees. The only members of senior management that are parties to employment agreements are Raymond Wirta, the Chief Executive Officer; Brett White, the President; and Kenneth Kay, the Chief Financial Officer. If any of the key employees leave and the Company is unable to quickly hire and integrate a qualified replacement, business and results of operations may suffer. In addition, the growth of the business is largely dependent upon the Company's ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of the business, including brokerage and property management personnel. If the Company is unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, growth may be limited, and business and operating results could suffer.
If the Company fails to comply with laws and regulations applicable to real estate brokerage and mortgage transactions and other segments of its business, it may incur significant financial penalties.
Due to the broad geographic scope of the Company's operations and the numerous forms of real estate services performed, the Company is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations specific to the services performed. For example, the brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions requires the Company to maintain brokerage licenses in each state in which the Company operates. If the Company fails to maintain its licenses or conducts brokerage activities without a license, it may be required to pay fines, return commissions received or have licenses suspended. In addition, because the size and scope of real estate sales transactions have increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the numerous state licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased. Furthermore, the laws and regulations applicable to the Company's business, both in the US and in foreign countries, may change in ways that materially increase the costs of compliance.
The Company may have liabilities in connection with real estate brokerage and property management activities.
As a licensed real estate broker, the Company and its licensed employees are subject to statutory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations. Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject the Company or its employees to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased 11 properties they brokered or managed. The Company could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales claiming that it did not fulfill its statutory obligations as a broker.
In addition, in the Company's property management business, it hires and supervises third party contractors to provide construction and engineering services for its managed properties. While the Company's role is limited to that of a supervisor, it may be subjected to claims for construction defects or other similar actions. Adverse outcomes of property management litigation could negatively impact the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
The Company's results of operations vary significantly among quarters, which makes comparison of its quarterly results difficult.
A significant portion of the Company's revenue is seasonal. Historically, this seasonality has caused the Company's revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year. The concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industry-wide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal year-end while incurring constant, non-variable expenses throughout the year.
Employees At December31, 2002, the Company had approximately 9,500 employees. The Company believes that relations with its employees are good.
Item 2. Properties The Company leases the following offices: Location Sales Offices Corporate Offices Total Americas 134 2 136 Europe, Middle East and Africa 43 1 44 Asia Pacific 25 1 26 Total 202 4 206 The Company does not own any offices, which is consistent with its strategy to lease instead of own. In general, these offices are fully utilized. There is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet the Company's needs, although rental rates in some markets may negatively affect the Company's profits in those markets.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, its ordinary course of business. Management believes that any liability that may result from disposition of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2002.
12 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters The Company's common stock is not publicly traded on any exchange or in any market. At February28, 2003, the Company had seventy-eight record holders of its ClassA common stock and ten record holders of its ClassB common stock. The Company has not declared any cash dividends on its common stock. The Company's existing credit agreement restricts its ability to pay dividends on its common stock, and the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the near future.
From November7, 1997 to July20, 2001, the common stock of CB Richard Ellis Services,Inc. (CBRE) traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol "CBG." On July20, 2001, CBRE merged with a subsidiary of the Company, with CBRE as the surviving corporation, and the common stock of CBRE was delisted from the NYSE. The Company owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of CBRE. CBRE has never declared any cash dividends on its capital stock.

(4) For the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001 the 7,845,004 and the 7,909,797 represent the weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively. These balances take into consideration the lower number of shares outstanding prior to the merger with CBRE. The 14,380,414 represents the outstanding number of shares at December31, 2001.
14 (5) EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges, represents earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and excludes the impact of merger-related and other nonrecurring charges, if any. Management believes that the presentation of EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges, will enhance a reader's understanding of the Company's operating performance and ability to service debt as it provides a measure of cash generated (subject to the payment of interest and income taxes) that can be used to service debt and for other required or discretionary purposes. Additionally, many of the Company's debt covenants are based upon EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges. Net cash that will be available to the Company for discretionary purposes represents remaining cash after debt service and other cash requirements, such as capital expenditures, are deducted from EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges. EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges, should not be considered as an alternative to (i)operating income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or (ii)operating cash flow determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company's calculation of EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources contained within this report on Form10-K is more clearly understood when read in conjunction with the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements elaborate on certain terms that are used throughout this discussion and provide information about the Company and the basis of presentation used in this report on Form10-K.
The Company is one of the world's largest global commercial real estate services firms in terms of revenue, offering a full range of services to commercial real estate occupiers, owners, lenders and investors. Operations are conducted in 47 countries through 206 offices with approximately 9,500 employees. The Company has worldwide capabilities to assist buyers in the purchase and sellers in the disposition of commercial property, to assist tenants in finding available space and owners in finding qualified tenants, to provide valuation and appraisals for real estate property, to assist in the placement of financing for commercial real estate, to provide commercial loan servicing, to provide research and consulting services, to help institutional investors manage commercial real estate portfolios, to provide property and facilities management services and to serve as the outsource service provider to corporations seeking to be relieved of the responsibility for managing their real estate operations.
15 A significant portion of the Company's revenue is seasonal. Historically, this seasonality has caused the Company's revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year. The concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industry-wide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal year-end while incurring constant, non-variable expenses throughout the year. In addition, the Company's operations are directly affected by actual and perceived trends in various national and economic conditions, including interest rates, the availability of credit to finance commercial real estate transactions and the impact of tax laws. The international operations are subject to political instability, currency fluctuations and changing regulatory environments. To date, the Company does not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon its operations. Revenue, commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand rather than general inflation.
On July20, 2001, the Company acquired CB Richard Ellis Services,Inc. (CBRE), (the 2001 Merger), pursuant to an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May31, 2001 (the 2001 Merger Agreement), among the Company, CBRE and Blum CB Corp. (Blum CB), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Blum CB was merged with and into CBRE, with CBRE being the surviving corporation. At the effective time of the 2001 Merger, CBRE became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
The results of operations, including the segment operations and cash flows, for the year ended December31, 2001 have been derived by combining the results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the period from February20, 2001 (inception) to December31, 2001 with the results of operations and cash flows of CBRE, prior to the 2001 Merger, from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001, the date of the 2001 Merger. The results of operations and cash flows of CBRE prior to the 2001 Merger incorporated in the following discussion are the historical results and cash flows of CBRE, the predecessor to the Company. These CBRE results do not reflect any purchase accounting adjustments, which are included in the results of the Company subsequent to the 2001 Merger. Due to the effects of purchase accounting applied as a result of the 2001 Merger and the additional interest expense associated with the debt incurred to finance the 2001 Merger, the results of operations of the Company may not be comparable in all respects to the results of operations for CBRE prior to the 2001 Merger. However, the Company's management believes a discussion of the 2001 operations is more meaningful by combining the results of the Company with the results of CBRE.
On February17, 2003, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Insignia Financial Group,Inc. Additional information regarding this transaction is included in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 16 Results of Operations The following table sets forth items derived from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: Year Ended December31 2002 2001 2000 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue 1,170,277 100.0 % 1,170,762 100.0 % 1,323,604 100.0 % Costs and expenses: Commissions, fees and other incentives 554,942 47.4 547,577 46.8 628,097 47.4 Operating, administrative and other 493,949 42.2 512,632 43.8 551,528 41.7 Depreciation and amortization 24,614 2.1 37,854 3.2 43,199 3.3 Equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries (9,326 ) (0.8 ) (4,428 ) (0.4 ) (6,505 ) (0.5 ) Merger-related and other nonrecurring charges 36  28,569 2.5   Operating income 106,062 9.1 48,558 4.1 107,285 8.1 Interest income 3,272 0.3 3,994 0.4 2,554 0.2 Interest expense 60,501 5.2 50,020 4.3 41,700 3.2 Income before provision for income taxes 48,833 4.2 2,532 0.2 68,139 5.1 Provision for income taxes 30,106 2.6 19,126 1.6 34,751 2.6 Net income (loss) $ 18,727 1.6 % $ (16,594 ) (1.4 )% $ 33,388 2.5 % EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges $ 130,712 11.2 % $ 114,981 9.8 % $ 150,484 11.4 % EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges, is calculated as follows: Year Ended December31 2002 2001 2000 (Dollars in thousands) Operating income $ 106,062 $ 48,558 $ 107,285 Add: Depreciation and amortization 24,614 37,854 43,199 EBITDA 130,676 86,412 150,484 Add: Merger-related and other nonrecurring charges 36 28,569  EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges $ 130,712 $ 114,981 $ 150,484 EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges, represents earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and excludes the impact of merger-related and other nonrecurring charges, if any. Management believes that the presentation of EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges, will enhance a reader's understanding of the Company's operating performance and ability to service debt as it provides a measure of cash generated (subject to the payment of interest and income taxes) that can be used to service debt and for other required or discretionary purposes. Additionally, many of the Company's debt covenants are based upon EBITDA, excluding merger related and other nonrecurring charges. Net cash that will be available to the Company for discretionary purposes represents remaining cash after debt service and other cash requirements, such as capital expenditures, are deducted from EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges. EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges, should not be considered as an alternative to (i)operating income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or (ii)operating cash 17 flow determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company's calculation of EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Year Ended December31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2001 The Company reported consolidated net income of $18.7million for the year ended December31, 2002 on revenue of $1,170.3million as compared to a consolidated net loss of $16.6million on revenue of $1,170.8million for the year ended December31, 2001.
Revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December31, 2002 was comparable to the year ended December31, 2001. Declines in lease transaction revenue, principally in the Americas and Asia Pacific, combined with a nonrecurring prior year sale of mortgage fund contracts of $5.6million, was mostly offset by higher worldwide sales transaction revenue, consulting fees, investment management fees and loan fees.
Commissions, fees and other incentives on a consolidated basis totaled $554.9million for the year ended December31, 2002, an increase of $7.4million or 1.3% from the year ended December31, 2001. Commissions, fees and other incentives as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 47.4% in the current year as compared to 46.8% in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher producer compensation within the Company's international operations associated with expanded international activities. These increases were partially offset by lower variable commissions, principally in the Americas, driven by lower lease transaction revenue.
Operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis were $493.9million for the year ended December31, 2002, a decrease of $18.7million or 3.6% as compared to the year ended December31, 2001. This decrease was primarily driven by cost cutting measures and operational efficiencies from programs initiated in May2001 as well as foreign currency transaction and settlement gains resulting from the weaker United States (US) dollar. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in bonuses and other incentives, primarily within the Company's international operations, due to higher results.
Depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis decreased by $13.2million or 35.0% mainly due to the discontinuation of goodwill amortization after the 2001 Merger in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.142 , "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS No.142) and lower depreciation expense, principally due to lower capital expenditures in the current year. The year ended December31, 2002 also included a reduction of amortization expense of $2.0million arising from the adjustment of certain intangible assets to their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date as determined by independent third party appraisers in 2002.
Equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries increased by $4.9million or 110.6% for the year ended December31, 2002 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to improved performance from several domestic joint ventures.
The year ended December31, 2001 included merger-related and other nonrecurring charges on a consolidated basis of $28.6million. These costs primarily consisted of merger-related costs of $18.3million, the write-off of assets, primarily e-business investments, of $7.2million as well as severance costs of $3.1million related to the Company's cost reduction program instituted in May2001.
Consolidated interest expense was $60.5million, an increase of $10.5million or 21.0% over the year ended December31, 2001. This was primarily attributable to the Company's change in debt structure as a result of the 2001 Merger.
Income tax expense on a consolidated basis was $30.1million for the year ended December31, 2002 as compared to $19.1million for the year ended December31, 2001. The income tax provision 18 and effective tax rate were not comparable between periods due to effects of the 2001 Merger and the adoption of SFAS No.142, which resulted in the elimination of the amortization of goodwill. In addition, the decline in the market value of assets associated with the deferred compensation plan for which no tax benefit was realized contributed to an increased effective tax rate.
Year Ended December31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2000 The Company reported a consolidated net loss of $16.6million for the year ended December31, 2001 on revenue of $1,170.8million compared to consolidated net income of $33.4million on revenue of $1,323.6million for the year ended December31, 2000. The 2001 results include a nonrecurring sale of mortgage fund management contracts of $5.6million. The 2000 results include a nonrecurring sale of certain non-strategic assets of $4.7million.
Revenue on a consolidated basis decreased by $152.8million or 11.5% during the year ended December31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December31, 2000. This was mainly driven by a $98.2million decrease in lease transaction revenue and a $62.8million decline in sales transaction revenue during 2001. The lower revenue was primarily attributable to the Company's North American operation. However, the European and Asian operations also experienced lower sales and lease transaction revenue as compared to 2000. These decreases were slightly offset by a $6.4million or 11.0% increase in loan origination and servicing fees as well as a $6.0million or 8.1% increase in appraisal fees driven by increased refinancing activities due to a decline in interest rates in the US and increased fees in the European operation.
Commissions, fees and other incentives on a consolidated basis totaled $547.6million, a decrease of $80.5million or 12.8% for the year ended December31, 2001 as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to the lower sales and lease transaction revenue within North America. This decline in revenue also resulted in lower variable commissions expense within this region as compared to 2000. This was slightly offset by producer compensation within the international operations, which is typically fixed in nature and does not decrease as a result of lower revenue. Accordingly, commissions, fees and other incentives as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to 46.8% for 2001 as compared to 47.4% for 2000.
Operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis were $512.6million, a decrease of $38.9million or 7.1% for the year ended December31, 2001 as compared to the prior year. This decrease was due to cost cutting measures and operational efficiencies from programs initiated in May2001. An organizational restructure was also implemented after the 2001 Merger transaction that included the reduction of administrative staff in corporate and divisional headquarters and the scaling back of unprofitable operations. In addition, bonus incentives and profit share declined due to the Company's lower results.
Depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis decreased by $5.3million or 12.4% primarily due to the discontinuation of goodwill amortization after the 2001 Merger in accordance with SFAS No.142.
Equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased by $2.1million or 31.9% for the year ended December31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December31, 2000, primarily due to decreased results from several domestic joint ventures.
Merger-related and other nonrecurring charges on a consolidated basis were $28.6million for the year ended December31, 2001. This included merger-related costs of $18.3million, the write-off of assets, primarily e-business investments, of $7.2million and severance costs of $3.1million attributable to the Company's cost reduction program instituted in May2001.
Consolidated interest expense was $50.0million, an increase of $8.3million or 20.0% for the year ended December31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December31, 2000. This was attributable to the Company's increased debt as a result of the 2001 Merger.
19 Provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $19.1million for the year ended December31, 2001 as compared to a provision for income taxes of $34.8million for the year ended December31, 2000. The income tax provision and effective tax rate were not comparable between periods due to the 2001 Merger. In addition, the Company adopted SFAS No.142, which resulted in the elimination of the amortization of goodwill.
Segment Operations In the third quarter of 2001, subsequent to the 2001 Merger transaction, the Company reorganized its business segments as part of its efforts to reduce costs and streamline its operations. The Company reports its operations through three geographically organized segments: (1)Americas, (2)Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and (3)Asia Pacific. The Americas consists of operations located in the US, Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America. EMEA mainly consists of operations in Europe, while Asia Pacific includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The Americas 2001 results include a nonrecurring sale of mortgage fund contracts of $5.6million as well as merger-related and other nonrecurring charges of $26.9million. The Americas 2000 results include a nonrecurring sale of certain non-strategic assets of $4.7million. Asia Pacific's 2001 results include merger-related and other nonrecurring charges of $1.2million. The following table summarizes the revenue, costs and expenses and operating income (loss) by operating segment for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: Year Ended December31 2002 2001 2000 (Dollars in thousands) Americas Revenue $ 896,064 100.0 % $ 928,799 100.0 % $ 1,074,080 100.0 % Costs and expenses: Commissions, fees and other incentives 438,842 48.9 448,813 48.4 530,284 49.3 Operating, administrative and other 367,312 41.0 388,645 41.8 422,698 39.4 Depreciation and amortization 16,958 1.9 27,452 3.0 28,600 2.7 Equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries (8,425 ) (0.9 ) (3,808 ) (0.4 ) (5,553 ) (0.5 ) Merger-related and other nonrecurring charges 36  26,923 2.8   Operating income $ 81,341 9.1 % $ 40,774 4.4 % $ 98,051 9.1 % EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges $ 98,335 11.0 % $ 95,149 10.2 % $ 126,651 11.8 % EMEA Revenue $ 182,222 100.0 % $ 161,306 100.0 % $ 164,539 100.0 % Costs and expenses: Commissions, fees and other incentives 75,475 41.4 63,343 39.3 61,194 37.1 Operating, administrative and other 84,963 46.6 81,728 50.6 84,172 51.2 Depreciation and amortization 4,579 2.5 6,492 4.0 9,837 6.0 Equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries (82 )  (2 )  (3 )  Merger-related and other nonrecurring charges   451 0.3   Operating income $ 17,287 9.5 % $ 9,294 5.8 % $ 9,339 5.7 % EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges $ 21,866 12.0 % $ 16,237 10.1 % $ 19,176 11.7 % Asia Pacific Revenue $ 91,991 100.0 % $ 80,657 100.0 % $ 84,985 100.0 % Costs and expenses: Commissions, fees and other incentives 40,625 44.2 35,421 43.9 36,619 43.1 Operating, administrative and other 41,674 45.3 42,259 52.4 44,658 52.5 Depreciation and amortization 3,077 3.3 3,910 4.9 4,762 5.6 Equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries (819 ) (0.9 ) (618 ) (0.8 ) (949 ) (1.1 ) Merger-related and other nonrecurring charges   1,195 1.5   Operating income (loss) $ 7,434 8.1 % $ (1,510 ) (1.9 )% $ (105 ) (0.1 )% EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges $ 10,511 11.4 % $ 3,595 4.5 % $ 4,657 5.5 % 20 EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges, is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (Dollars in thousands) Americas Operating income $ 81,341 $ 40,774 $ 98,051 Add: Depreciation and amortization 16,958 27,452 28,600 EBITDA 98,299 68,226 126,651 Add: Merger-related and other nonrecurring charges 36 26,923  EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges $ 98,335 $ 95,149 $ 126,651 EMEA Operating income $ 17,287 $ 9,294 $ 9,339 Add: Depreciation and amortization 4,579 6,492 9,837 EBITDA 21,866 15,786 19,176 Add: Merger-related and other nonrecurring charges  451  EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges $ 21,866 $ 16,237 $ 19,176 Asia Pacific Operating income (loss) $ 7,434 $ (1,510 ) $ (105 ) Add: Depreciation and amortization 3,077 3,910 4,762 EBITDA 10,511 2,400 4,657 Add: Merger-related and other nonrecurring charges  1,195  EBITDA, excluding merger-related and other nonrecurring charges $ 10,511 $ 3,595 $ 4,657 Year Ended December31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2001 Americas Revenue decreased by $32.7million or 3.5% for the year ended December31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December31, 2001, primarily driven by lower lease transaction revenue, partially offset by an increase in sales transaction revenue and loan fees. The lease transaction revenue decrease was primarily due to a lower average value per transaction partially offset by a higher number of transactions. The sales transaction revenue increase was driven by a higher number of transactions as well as a higher average value per transaction. Loan fees also increased compared to the prior year principally due to an increase in the number of transactions.
Commissions, fees and other incentives decreased by $10.0million or 2.2% for the year ended December31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December31, 2001, caused primarily by lower variable commissions due to lower lease transaction revenue. Commissions, fees and other incentives as a percentage of revenue were relatively flat when compared to the prior year at approximately 48.9%.
Operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $21.3million or 5.5% as a result of cost reduction and efficiency measures, the organizational restructure implemented after the 2001 Merger, and foreign currency transaction and settlement gains resulting from the weaker US dollar.
EMEA Revenue increased by $20.9million or 13.0% for the year ended December31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December31, 2001. This was mainly driven by higher sales transaction revenue across Europe as well as higher lease transaction revenue and investment management fees in France.
Commissions, fees and other incentives increased by $12.1million or 19.2% due to higher producer 21 compensation as a result of increased revenue arising from expanded activities in the United Kingdom (UK), France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $3.2million or 4.0% mainly attributable to higher incentives due to increased results, higher occupancy costs and consulting fees.
Asia Pacific Revenue increased by $11.3million or 14.1% for the year ended December31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December31, 2001. This increase was primarily driven by higher investment management fees in Japan and an increase in overall revenue in Australia and New Zealand, partially offset by lower revenues as a result of conversions of small, wholly owned offices to affiliate offices elsewhere in Asia.
Commissions, fees and other incentives increased by $5.2million or 14.7% primarily driven by higher producer compensation expense due to increased personnel requirements in Australia, China and New Zealand, slightly offset by lower commissions due to conversions to affiliate offices elsewhere in Asia.
Operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $0.6million or 1.4% primarily as a result of conversions to affiliate offices. This decrease was mostly offset by an increased accrual for bonuses due to higher results in Australia and New Zealand.
Year Ended December31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2000 Americas Revenue decreased by $145.3million or 13.5% for the year ended December31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December31, 2000, primarily driven by the softening global economy as well as the tragic events of September11, 2001. Lease transaction revenue decreased by $85.3million and sales transaction revenue declined by $55.5million due to a lower number of transactions completed as well as a lower average value per transaction during 2001 as compared to 2000. Consulting and referral fees also decreased by $12.1million or 20.0% as compared to 2000. These declines were slightly offset by an increase in loan origination and servicing fees of $6.4million as well as higher appraisal fees of $4.4million driven by increased refinancing activities due to the low interest rate environment in North America.
Commissions, fees and other incentives decreased by $81.5million or 15.4% for the year ended December31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December31, 2000, caused primarily by the lower lease transaction and sales transaction revenue. The decline in revenue also resulted in lower variable commissions expense. As a result, commissions, fees and other incentives as a percentage of revenue decreased from 49.3% in 2000 to 48.4% in 2001.
Operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $34.1million or 8.1% as a result of cost reduction and efficiency measures initiated in May2001 as well as the organizational restructure implemented after the 2001 Merger. Key executive bonuses and profit share also declined due to the lower results.
EMEA Revenue decreased by $3.2million or 2.0% for the year ended December31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December31, 2000. This was mainly driven by lower sales transaction and lease transaction revenue due to the overall weakness in the European economy, particularly in France and Germany. This was slightly offset by higher consulting and referral fees in the UK as well as an overall increase in appraisal fees throughout Europe.
Commissions, fees and other incentives increased by $2.1million or 3.5% for the year ended December31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December31, 2000, primarily due to a higher number of producers, mainly in the UK. Producer compensation in EMEA is typically fixed in nature and does not decrease with a decline in revenue.
Operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $2.4million or 2.9% for the year ended December31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December31, 2000, mainly attributable to decreased bonuses and other incentives due to lower 2001 results.
22 Asia Pacific Revenue decreased by $4.3million or 5.1% for the year ended December31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December31, 2000. This was primarily driven by lower lease transaction revenue due to the weak economy in China and Singapore.
Operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $2.4million or 5.4% for the year ended December31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December31, 2000. The decrease was primarily due to lower personnel requirements and other cost containment measures put in place during May2001 as well as the organizational restructure implemented after the 2001 Merger.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Pursuant to the terms of the 2001 Merger Agreement, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of CBRE was converted into the right to receive $16.00 in cash, except for: (i)shares of common stock of CBRE owned by the Company and Blum CB immediately prior to the 2001 Merger, totaling 7,967,774 shares, which were cancelled, (ii)treasury shares and shares of common stock of CBRE owned by any of its subsidiaries which were cancelled and (iii)shares of common stock of CBRE held by stockholders who perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Delaware law. All shares of common stock of CBRE outstanding prior to the 2001 Merger were acquired by the Company and subsequently cancelled. Immediately prior to the 2001 Merger, the following, collectively referred to as the buying group, contributed to the Company all the shares of CBRE's common stock that he or it directly owned in exchange for an equal number of shares of ClassB common stock of the Company: Blum Strategic Partners, L.P. (formerly known as RCBA Strategic Partners, L.P.), FS Equity Partners III, L.P. (FSEP), a Delaware limited partnership, FS Equity Partners International, L.P. (FSEP International), a Delaware limited partnership, The Koll Holding Company, a California corporation, Frederic V. Malek, a director of the Company and CBRE, Raymond E. Wirta, the Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company and CBRE, and Brett White, the President and a director of the Company and CBRE. Such shares of common stock of CBRE, which totaled 7,967,774 shares of common stock, were then cancelled. In addition, the Company offered to purchase for cash, options outstanding to acquire common stock of CBRE at a purchase price per option equal to the greater of the amount by which $16.00 exceeded the exercise price of the option, if at all, or $1.00. In connection with the 2001 Merger, CBRE purchased its outstanding options on behalf of the Company, which were recorded as merger-related and other nonrecurring charges by CBRE in the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001.
The funding to complete the 2001 Merger, as well as the refinancing of substantially all of the outstanding indebtedness of CBRE, was obtained through: (i)the cash contribution of $74.8million from the sale of ClassB common stock of the Company for $16.00 per share, (ii)the sale of shares of ClassA common stock of the Company for $16.00 per share to employees and independent contractors of CBRE, (iii)the sale of 625,000 shares of ClassA common stock of the Company to the California Public Employees' Retirement System for $16.00 per share, (iv)the issuance and sale by the Company of 65,000 units for $65.0million to DLJ Investment Funding,Inc. and other purchasers, which units consist of $65.0million in aggregate principal amount of 16% Senior Notes due July20, 2011 and 339,820 shares of ClassA common stock of the Company, (v)the issuance and sale by Blum CB of $229.0million in aggregate principal amount of 11 1 / 4 % Senior Subordinated Notes due June15, 2011 for $225.6million (which were assumed by CBRE in connection with the 2001 Merger) and (vi)borrowings by CBRE under a new $325.0million senior credit agreement with Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) and other lenders.
Following the 2001 Merger, the common stock of CBRE was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. CBRE also successfully completed a tender offer and consent solicitation for all of the outstanding principal amount of its 8 7 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 (the Subordinated Notes). The Subordinated Notes were purchased at $1,079.14 for each $1,000 principal amount of 23 Subordinated Notes, which included a consent payment of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount of Subordinated Notes. The Company also repaid the outstanding balance of CBRE's existing revolving credit facility. The Company entered into the 2001 Merger in order to enhance the flexibility to operate CBRE's existing businesses and to develop new ones.
On February17, 2003, the Company, CBRE, Apple Acquisition Corp. (the Merger Sub) and Insignia Financial Group,Inc. (Insignia) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Insignia Acquisition Agreement). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Insignia Acquisition Agreement, the Merger Sub will merge with and into Insignia, the separate existence of the Merger Sub will cease and Insignia will continue its existence as a wholly owned subsidiary of CBRE (the Insignia Acquisition).
When the Insignia Acquisition becomes effective, each outstanding share of common stock of Insignia (other than the cancelled shares, dissenting shares and shares held by wholly owned subsidiaries of Insignia) will be converted into the right to receive $11.00 in cash, without interest, from the Merger Sub, subject to adjustments as provided in the Insignia Acquisition Agreement. At the same time, each outstanding share of common stock of the Merger Sub will be converted into one share of common stock of the surviving entity in the Insignia Acquisition.
As of February17, 2003, the transaction was valued at approximately $415.0million, including the repayment of net debt and the redemption of preferred stock. In addition to Insignia shareholder approval, the transaction, which is expected to close in June2003, is subject to the receipt of financing and regulatory approvals. The sale by Insignia on March14, 2003 of its residential real estate services subsidiaries, Insignia Douglas Elliman LLC and Insignia Residential Group, Inc., to Montauk Battery Realty, LLC and Insignia's receipt of the cash proceeds from such sale will not affect the consideration to be paid in the Insignia Acquisition.
The Company believes it can satisfy its non-acquisition obligations, as well as working capital requirements and funding of investments, with internally generated cash flow, borrowings under the revolving line of credit with CSFB and other lenders or any replacement credit facilities. In the near term, further material acquisitions, if any, that necessitate cash will require new sources of capital such as an expansion of the revolving credit facility and/or issuing additional debt or equity. The Company anticipates that its existing sources of liquidity, including cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet its anticipated non-acquisition cash requirements for the foreseeable future, but at a minimum for the next twelve months.
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $64.9million for the current year, an increase of $93.8million compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to improved 2002 earnings, as well as lower payments made in the current year for 2001 bonus and profit sharing as compared to the 2000 bonus and profit sharing payments made in the prior year.
The Company utilized $24.1million in investing activities during the current year, a decrease of $249.4million compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to the prior year payment of the purchase price and related expenses associated with the acquisition of CBRE by the Company. Capital expenditures of $14.3million, net of concessions received, were lower than 2001 by $7.0million driven primarily by efforts to reduce spending and improve cash flow. Capital expenditures for 2002 and 2001 consisted primarily of purchases of computer hardware and software and furniture and fixtures. The Company expects to have capital expenditures, net of concessions received, of approximately $28.8million in 2003 due to leasehold improvements anticipated in New York and London.
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $17.8million for the year ended December31, 2002, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $340.1million for the year ended December31, 24 2001. This decrease was mainly attributable to the debt and equity financing required by the 2001 Merger in the prior year.
The Company issued $229.0million in aggregate principal amount of 11 1 / 4 % Senior Subordinated Notes due June15, 2011 (the Notes), which were issued and sold by Blum CB Corp. for approximately $225.6million, net of discount, on June7, 2001 and assumed by CBRE in connection with the 2001 Merger. The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Company and its domestic subsidiaries. The Notes require semi-annual payments of interest in arrears on June15 and December15, having commenced on December15, 2001, and are redeemable in whole or in part on or after June15, 2006 at 105.625% of par on that date and at declining prices thereafter. In addition, before June15, 2004, the Company may redeem up to 35.0% of the originally issued amount of the Notes at 111 1 / 4 % of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, solely with the net cash proceeds from public equity offerings. In the event of a change of control, the Company is obligated to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a redemption price of 101.0% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The amounts included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, net of unamortized discount, were $225.9million and $225.7million at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The Company also entered into a $325.0million Senior Credit Facility (the Credit Facility) with CSFB and other lenders. The Credit Facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of their assets. The Credit Facility includes the Tranche A term facility of $50.0million, maturing on July20, 2007; the Tranche B term facility of $185.0million, maturing on July18, 2008; and the revolving line of credit of $90.0million, including revolving credit loans, letters of credit and a swingline loan facility, maturing on July20, 2007. Borrowings under the Tranche A and revolving facility bear interest at varying rates based on the Company's option at either three-month LIBOR plus 2.50% to 3.25% or the alternate base rate plus 1.50% to 2.25% as determined by reference to the Company's ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA, which is defined in the debt agreement. Borrowings under the Tranche B facility bear interest at varying rates based on the Company's option at either three-month LIBOR plus 3.75% or the alternate base rate plus 2.75%. The alternate base rate is the higher of (1)CSFB's prime rate or (2)the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus one-half of one percent.
The Tranche A facility will be repaid by July20, 2007 through quarterly principal payments over six years, which total $7.5million each year through June30, 2003 and $8.75million each year thereafter through July20, 2007. The Tranche B facility requires quarterly principal payments of approximately $0.5million, with the remaining outstanding principal due on July18, 2008. The revolving line of credit requires the repayment of any outstanding balance for a period of 45 consecutive days commencing on any day in the month of December of each year as determined by the Company. The Company repaid its revolving credit facility as of November5, 2002 and December1, 2001, and at December31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had no revolving line of credit principal outstanding. The total amount outstanding under the Credit Facility included in senior secured term loans and current maturities of long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was $221.0million and $230.3million at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The Company issued an aggregate principal amount of $65.0million of 16.0% Senior Notes due on July20, 2011 (the Senior Notes). The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations, senior to all current and future unsecured indebtedness, but subordinated to all current and future secured indebtedness of the Company. Interest accrues at a rate of 16.0% per year and is payable quarterly in cash in arrears. Interest may be paid in kind to the extent CBRE's ability to pay cash dividends is restricted by the terms of the Credit Facility. Additionally, interest in excess of 12.0% may, at the Company's option, be paid in kind through July 2006. The Company elected to pay in kind interest in excess of 12.0%, or 4.0%, that was payable on April20, 2002, July20, 2002 and October20, 2002. The Senior Notes are redeemable at the Company's option, in whole or in part, at 116.0% of par commencing on July20, 25 2001 and at declining prices thereafter. As of December31, 2002, the redemption price was 112.8% of par. In the event of a change in control, the Company is obligated to make an offer to purchase all of the outstanding Senior Notes at 101.0% of par. The total amount included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was $61.9million and $59.7million, net of unamortized discount, at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The Senior Notes are solely the Company's obligation to repay. CBRE has neither guaranteed nor pledged any of its assets as collateral for the Senior Notes and is not obligated to provide cashflow to the Company for repayment of these Senior Notes. However, the Company has no substantive assets or operations other than its investment in CBRE to meet any required principal and interest payments on the Senior Notes. The Company will depend on CBRE's cash flows to fund principal and interest payments as they come due.
The Notes, the Credit Facility and the Senior Notes all contain numerous restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or distributions to stockholders, repurchase capital stock or debt, make investments, sell assets or subsidiary stock, engage in transactions with affiliates, issue subsidiary equity and enter into consolidations or mergers. The credit facility requires the Company to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of interest and certain fixed charges and a maximum leverage and senior leverage ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to funded debt. The Credit Facility requires the Company to pay a facility fee based on the total amount of the unused commitment.
On March12, 2002, Moody's Investor Service downgraded the Company's senior secured term loans and Senior Subordinated Notes to B1 from Ba3 and to B3 from B2, respectively. On February23, 2003, Moody's Investor Service confirmed the ratings of the Company's senior secured term loans and Senior Subordinated Notes at B1 and B3, respectively. On May21, 2002 Standard and Poor's Ratings Service affirmed the ratings of the Company's senior secured term loans and Senior Subordinated Notes at BB- and B, respectively, but revised the outlook from stable to negative. On February19, 2003, Standard and Poor's Ratings Service placed its ratings on the Company on CreditWatch with negative implications in response to the Company's announced acquisition of Insignia. Neither the Moody's nor the Standard and Poor's ratings impact the Company's ability to borrow or affect the Company's interest rates for the senior secured term loans.
A subsidiary of the Company has a credit agreement with Residential Funding Corporation (RFC) for the purpose of funding mortgage loans that will be resold. The credit agreement in 2001 initially provided for a revolving line of credit of $150.0million, bore interest at the greater of one-month LIBOR or 3.0% (RFC Base Rate), plus 1.0%, and expired on August31, 2001. Through various executed amendments and extension letters in 2001, the revolving line of credit was increased to $350.0million and the maturity date was extended to January22, 2002.
Effective January23, 2002, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Warehousing Credit and Security Agreement. This agreement provided for a revolving line of credit in the amount of $350.0million until February28, 2002 and $150.0million for the period from March1, 2002 through August31, 2002. Additionally, on February1, 2002, the Company executed a Letter Agreement with RFC that redefined the RFC Base Rate to the greater of one-month LIBOR or 2.25% per annum. On April20, 2002, the Company obtained a temporary revolving line of credit increase of $210.0million that resulted in a total line of credit equaling $360.0million, which expired on July31, 2002. Upon expiration of the temporary increase and through various executed amendments and extension letter agreements, the Company established a revolving line of credit of $200.0million, redefined the RFC Base Rate to the greater of one-month LIBOR or 2.0% and extended the maturity date of the agreement to December20, 2002. On December16, 2002, the Company entered into the Third Amended and Restated Warehousing Credit and Security Agreement effective December20, 26 2002. The agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of $200.0million, bears interest at the RFC Base Rate plus 1.0% and expires on August31, 2003.
During the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, the Company had a maximum of $309.0million and $164.0million revolving line of credit principal outstanding with RFC. At December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, the Company had a $63.1million and a $106.8million warehouse line of credit outstanding, which are included in short-term borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the Company had a $63.1million and a $106.8million warehouse receivable, which are also included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Subsequent to December31, 2002 and 2001, the warehouse lines of credit that were outstanding on those dates were repaid with the proceeds from the warehouse receivables.
A subsidiary of the Company has a credit agreement with JP Morgan Chase. The credit agreement provides for a non-recourse revolving line of credit of up to $20.0million, bears interest at 1.0% of the bank's cost of funds and expires on May28, 2003. At December31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had no revolving line of credit principal outstanding.
During 2001, the Company incurred certain non-recourse debt through a joint venture. In September2002, the maturity date on this non-recourse debt was extended to June18, 2003. At December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, the Company had $40.0million and $37.2million of non-recourse debt outstanding, which is included in short-term borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Acquisitions During 2001, the Company acquired a professional real estate services firm in Mexico for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.7million in cash. The Company also purchased the remaining ownership interests that it did not already own in CB Richard Ellis/Hampshire, LLC for a purchase price of approximately $1.8million in cash.
Litigation The Company is a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, its ordinary course of business. Management believes that any liability that may result from disposition of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
27 Net Operating Losses The Company had federal income tax net operating losses (NOLs) of approximately $7.9million at December31, 2001 and had no federal income tax NOLs at December31, 2002.
Related Party Transactions The Company's investment management business involves investing the Company's own capital in certain real estate investments with clients, including its equity investments in CB Richard Ellis Strategic Partners,LP, Global Innovation Partners, LLC and other co-investments. The Company has provided investment management, property management, brokerage, appraisal and other professional services to these equity investees and earned revenues from these co-investments of $22.4million, $15.4million and $7.3million during the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is a note receivable from the Company's equity investment in Investor 1031, LLC in the amount of $1.2million as of December31, 2002. This note was issued on June20, 2002, bears interest at 20.0% per annum and is due for repayment on July15, 2003.
Included in other current and long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are employee loans of $5.9million and $1.6million as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The majority of these loans represent prepaid retention and recruitment awards issued to employees at varying principal amounts, bear interest at rates up to 10.0% per annum and mature on various dates through 2007. These loans and related interest are typically forgiven over time, assuming that the relevant employee is still employed by, and is in good standing with, the Company. As of December31, 2002, the outstanding employee loan balances included a $0.3million loan to Raymond Wirta, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and a $0.2million loan to Brett White, the Company's President. These non-interest bearing loans to Mr.Wirta and Mr.White were issued during 2002 and are due and payable on December31, 2003.
The accompanying consolidated balance sheets also include $4.8million and $5.9million of notes receivable from sale of stock as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These notes are primarily composed of full-recourse loans to employees, officers and certain shareholders of the Company, which are secured by the Company's common stock that is owned by the borrowers. These full-recourse loans are at varying principal amounts, require quarterly interest payments, bear interest at rates up to 10.0% per annum and mature on various dates through 2010.
Pursuant to the Company's 1996 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP), Mr.Wirta purchased 30,000 shares of CBRE common stock in 2000 at a purchase price of $12.875 per share that was paid for by delivery of a full recourse promissory note bearing interest at 7.40%. As part of the 2001 Merger, the 30,000 shares of CBRE common stock were exchanged for 30,000 shares of ClassB common stock of the Company. These shares of ClassB common stock were substituted for the CBRE shares as security for the promissory note. All interest charged on the outstanding promissory note balance for any year is forgiven if Mr.Wirta's performance produces a high enough level of bonus (approximately $7,500 of interest is forgiven for each $10,000 of bonus). As a result of bonuses paid in 2001 and in 2002, all interest on Mr.Wirta's promissory note for 2000 and 2001 was forgiven. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, Mr.Wirta had an outstanding loan balance of $385,950, which is included in notes receivable from sale of common stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Pursuant to the Company's 1996 EIP, Mr. White purchased 25,000 shares of CBRE common stock in 1998 at a purchase price of $38.50 per share and 20,000 shares of CBRE common stock in 2000 at a purchase price of $12.875 per share. These purchases were paid for by delivery of full recourse promissory notes bearing interest at 7.40%. As part of the 2001 Merger, Mr.White's shares of CBRE common stock were exchanged for a like amount of shares of ClassB common stock of the Company. These shares of ClassB common stock were substituted for the CBRE shares as security for the notes.
28 A First Amendment to Mr.White's 1998 promissory note provided that the portion of the then outstanding principal in excess of the fair market value of the shares would be forgiven in the event that Mr.White was an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries on November16, 2002 and the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock was less than $38.50 on November16, 2002. Mr.White's 1998 promissory note was subsequently amended, terminating the First Amendment and adjusting the original 1998 Stock Purchase Agreement by reducing the purchase price from $38.50 to $16.00. During 2002, the 25,000 shares held as security for the Second Amended Promissory Note were tendered as full payment for the remaining balance of $400,000 on the 1998 promissory note. All interest charged on the outstanding promissory note balances for any year is forgiven if Mr.White's performance produces a high enough level of bonus (approximately $7,500 of interest is forgiven for each $10,000 of bonus). As a result of bonuses paid in 2001 and in 2002, all interest on Mr.White's promissory notes for 2000 and 2001 was forgiven. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, Mr.White had outstanding loan balances of $257,300 and $657,300, which are included in notes receivable from sale of common stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
As of December31, 2002 and 2001, Mr.White had an outstanding loan of $164,832, which is included in notes receivable from sale of common stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. This outstanding loan relates to the acquisition of 12,500 shares of CBRE's common stock prior to the 2001 Merger. Subsequent to the 2001 Merger, these shares were converted into shares in the Company's common stock and the related loan amount was carried forward. This loan bears interest at 6.0% and is payable at the earlier of: (i)October14, 2003, (ii)the date of the sale of shares held by the Company pursuant to the related security agreement or (iii)the date of the termination of Mr.White's employment.
At the time of the 2001 Merger, Mr. Wirta delivered to the Company an $80,000 promissory note, which bore interest at 10% per year, as payment for the purchase of 5,000 shares of the Company's ClassB common stock. Mr.Wirta repaid this promissory note in full in April of 2002. Additionally, Mr.Wirta and Mr.White delivered full-recourse notes in the amounts of $512,504 and $209,734, respectively, as payment for a portion of the shares purchased in connection with the 2001 Merger. During 2002, Mr.Wirta paid down his loan amount by $40,004 and Mr.White paid off his note in its entirety. As of December31, 2002, Mr.Wirta has an outstanding loan of $472,500, which is included in notes receivable from sale of common stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
In the event that the Company's common stock is not freely tradable on a national securities exchange or an over-the-counter market by June2004, the Company has agreed to loan Mr.Wirta up to $3.0million on a full-recourse basis to enable him to exercise an existing option to acquire shares held by The Koll Holding Company, if Mr.Wirta is employed by the Company at the time of exercise, was terminated without cause or resigned for good reason. This loan will become repayable upon the earliest to occur of: (1)90days following termination of his employment, other than by the Company without cause or by him for good reason, (2)seven months following the date the Company's common stock becomes freely tradable as described above or (3)the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the pledged shares. This loan will bear interest at the prime rate in effect on the date of the loan, compounded annually, and will be repayable to the extent of any net proceeds received by Mr.Wirta upon the sale of any shares of the Company's common stock. Mr.Wirta will pledge the shares received upon exercise of the option as security for the loan.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company 29 believes that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition The Company records real estate commissions on sales upon close of escrow or upon transfer of title. Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded as income once the Company satisfies all obligations under the commission agreement. A typical commission agreement provides that the Company earns a portion of the lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant, while the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission is earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy. The existence of any significant future contingencies will result in the delay of recognition of revenue until such contingencies are satisfied. For example, if the Company does not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays their first month's rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, the Company delays revenue recognition until cash rent is paid by the tenant. Investment management and property management fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related agreements. Appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered. Loan origination fees are recognized at the time the loan closes and the Company has no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction, while loan servicing fees are recorded to revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors. Other commissions, consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as income at the time the related services have been performed unless significant future contingencies exist.
In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, the Company makes assumptions with respect to their future collectibility. The Company's assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer's credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances. In addition to these individual assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are greater than 180days are fully provided for.
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CBRE Holding, Inc. (the Company) and majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. Additionally, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CBRE prior to the 2001 Merger as CBRE is considered the predecessor to the Company for purposes of RegulationS-X. The equity attributable to minority shareholders' interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company's investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but does not control, are accounted for under the equity method. Accordingly, the Company's share of the earnings of these equity-method basis companies is included in consolidated net income. All other investments held on a long-term basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of CBRE at July20, 2001, the date of the 2001 Merger. Other intangible assets include a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Merger, is not being amortized and has an indefinite estimated life. The remaining other intangible assets represent management contracts and loan servicing rights and are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging up to ten years.
The Company fully adopted SFAS No.142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective January1, 2002. This statement requires the Company to perform at least an annual assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives based on 30 assumptions and estimates of fair value and future cash flow information. In June2002, the Company completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test and determined that no impairment existed as of January1, 2002. The Company also completed its required annual impairment test as of October1, 2002 and determined that no impairment existed as of that date. An independent third-party valuation firm was engaged to perform all of the impairment tests.
New Accounting Pronouncements In June2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No.143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and (or) the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. The statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of its fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. SFAS No.143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2002. Adoption of this statement is not expected to have any material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
In April2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.145, " Rescission of FASB Statements No.4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No.13, and Technical Corrections ." This statement rescinds the following pronouncements:  SFAS No.4, " Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt "  SFAS No.44, " Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers "  SFAS No.64, " Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements " SFAS No.145 amends SFAS No.13, " Accounting for Leases ," to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. This statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions.
The provisions of this statement related to the rescission of SFAS No.4 shall be applied in fiscal years beginning after May15, 2002. The provisions of this statement related to SFAS No.13 shall be effective for transactions occurring after May15, 2002. All other provisions of this statement shall be effective for financial statements issued on or after May15, 2002. Adoption of this statement has not had and is not expected to have any material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
In July2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.146, " Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." This statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan and supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.94.3, " Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity ." SFAS No.146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December31, 2002. The Company will account for such costs, if any, under SFAS No.146 on a prospective basis.
In November2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN)45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," an interpretation of SFAS No.5, "Accounting for Contingencies," SFAS No.57, "Related Party Disclosures" and SFAS No.107, "Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments." This interpretation also rescinds FIN34, "Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN45 expands the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain 31 guarantees and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under certain guarantees. The disclosure requirements of FIN45 are effective as of December31, 2002, and require disclosure of the nature of the guarantee, the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee and the current amount of the liability, if any, for the guarantor's obligations under the guarantee. The recognition requirements of FIN45 are to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002. The adoption of FIN45 has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
In December2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure." This statement amends SFAS No.123 , "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No.148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.123 to require prominent disclosures about the effect on reported net income of an entity's accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation. Finally, SFAS No.148 amends Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.28, "Interim Financial Reporting," to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. For entities that voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation, the transition and the disclosure provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2002. The amendments to APB No.28 are effective for interim periods beginning after December15, 2002. The Company continues to account for stock-based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No.25 and does not plan to voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation. The Company will adopt the interim disclosure provisions of SFAS No.148 for the quarter ended March31, 2003.
In January2003, the FASB issued FIN46, " Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which is an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No.51, "Consolidated Financial Statements." This interpretation addresses consolidation of entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks. The objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity (VIE) and determine when the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and results of operations of a VIE need to be consolidated with its primary beneficiary. A company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company's interest in the VIE is such that the company will absorb a majority of the VIE's expected losses and/or receive a majority of the VIE's expected residual returns or if the VIE does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. For VIEs in which a significant (but not majority) variable interest is held, certain disclosures are required. The consolidation requirements of FIN46 apply immediately to VIEs created after January31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to existing VIEs in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June15, 2003. Certain disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January31, 2003, regardless of when the VIE was established. The adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
Forward-Looking Statements Portions of this Form10-K, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements, which are generally identified by the use of terms such as "will," "expected" or similar expressions involving known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Company's actual results and performance in future periods to be materially different from any future results or performance suggested in forward-looking statements in this Form10-K. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and the Company expressly disclaims any obligation 32 to update or revise any forward-looking statements found herein to reflect any changes in its expectations or results or any change in events. Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: commercial real estate vacancy levels; employment conditions and their effect on vacancy rates; property values; rental rates; any general economic recession domestically or internationally; and general conditions of financial liquidity for real estate transactions.
Item7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company's exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations.
Approximately 27% of the Company's business is transacted in local currencies of foreign countries. The Company attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities, and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes. The Company routinely monitors its transaction exposure to currency exchange rate changes and occasionally enters into currency forward and option contracts to limit its exposure, as appropriate. As of December31, 2002, the Company was not a party to any such contracts. The Company does not engage in any speculative activities in respect of foreign currency.
The Company manages its interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt. The Company's fixed and variable long-term debt at December31, 2002 consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): Year of Maturity Fixed Rate One-Month Yen LIBOR +4.95% Greater of 3.0% or One-Month LIBOR +1.0% Three-Month LIBOR +3.25% Three-Month LIBOR +3.75% Interest Rate Range of 4.37% to 6.50% Total 2003 $ 752 $ 40,005 $ 63,140 $ 8,125 $ 1,850 $ 7,904 $ 121,776 2004 40   8,750 1,850  10,640 2005 23   8,750 1,850  10,623 2006 19   8,750 1,850  10,619 2007 19   4,375 1,850  6,244 Thereafter(1) 300,032    172,975  473,007 Total $ 300,885 $ 40,005 $ 63,140 $ 38,750 $ 182,225 $ 7,904 $ 632,909 Weighted Average Interest Rate 12.1 % 5.0 % 3.0 % 4.7 % 5.2 % 4.9 % 8.2 % (1) Primarily includes the 11 1 / 4 % Senior Subordinated Notes, the 16% Senior Notes and the TrancheB term loans under the senior secured credit facilities.
The Company utilizes sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of its variable rate debt. If interest rates were to increase by 47 basis points, approximately 10% of the weighted average variable rate at year end, the net impact would be a decrease of $1.6million on annual pre-tax income and cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December31, 2002.
Based on dealers' quotes, the estimated fair value of the Company's $225.9million 11 1 / 4 % Senior Subordinated Notes is $208.4million at December31, 2002. There was no trading activity for the 16% Senior Notes, which are due in 2011. Their carrying value as of December31, 2002 totaled $61.9million. Estimated fair values for the term loans under the senior secured credit facilities and the remaining long-term debt are not presented because the Company believes that they are not materially different from book value, primarily because the majority of the remaining debt is based on variable rates that approximate terms that could be obtained at December31, 2002.

34 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CBRE Holding,Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of CBRE Holding,Inc., a Delaware corporation, and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December31, 2002 and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income (loss) for the twelve months then ended. Our audit also included the 2002 financial statement schedule listed in the Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule at Item8. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 2002 financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audit. The consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule of the Company as of December31, 2001 and for the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001 and the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules of CB Richard Ellis Services,Inc. (the "Predecessor") for the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001 and for the twelve months ended December31, 2000 were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and stated that such 2001 and 2000 financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the 2001 and 2000 basic financial statements taken as a whole, presented fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein, in their report dated february26, 2002.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such 2002 consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December31, 2002 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the twelve months then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the 2002 financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002 to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS142").
As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December31, 2001 and for the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001 and the financial statements of the Predecessor for the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001 and for the twelve months ended December31, 2000 were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note8, these consolidated financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by SFAS142, which was adopted by the Company as of January1, 2002. Our audit procedures with respect to the disclosures in Note8 with respect to 2001 and 2000 included (i)comparing the previously reported net income (loss) to the previously issued consolidated financial statements and the adjustments to reported net income (loss) representing amortization expense (including any related tax effects) recognized in those periods relating to goodwill that is no longer being amortized as a result of applying SFAS142 to the Company's and the 35 Predecessor's underlying analysis obtained from management, and (ii)testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss) to reported net income (loss) and the related earnings (loss)-per-share amounts. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001 and 2000 in Note8 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Predecessor other than with respect to such disclosures, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
DELOITTE& TOUCHE LLP Los Angeles, California March21, 2003 36 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of CBRE Holding,Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of CBRE Holding,Inc., a Delaware corporation, (the Company) as of December31, 2001 and related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income for the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001. We have also audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of CB Richard Ellis Services,Inc. (Predecessor) as of December31, 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, stockholders' equity and comprehensive (loss) income for the period from January1, 2001 to July20, 2001, and the twelve months ended December31, 2000 and 1999. These financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of the Company's and the Predecessor's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CBRE Holding,Inc. as of December31, 2001 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001 and the financial position of CB Richard Ellis Services,Inc. (the Predecessor) as of December, 31 2000 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the period from January1, 2001 to July20, 2001, and the twelve months ended December31, 2000 and 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index to consolidated financial statements is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

43 CBRE HOLDINGINC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Nature of Operations CBRE Holding,Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated on February20, 2001 as Blum CB Holding Corporation. On March26, 2001, Blum CB Holding Corporation changed its name to CBRE Holding,Inc. (the Company). The Company and its former wholly owned subsidiary, Blum CB Corporation (Blum CB), a Delaware corporation, were created to acquire all of the outstanding shares of CB Richard Ellis Services,Inc. (CBRE), an international real estate services firm. Prior to July20, 2001, the Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of RCBA Strategic Partners,LP (RCBA Strategic), which is an affiliate of RichardC. Blum, a director of the Company and CBRE.
On July20, 2001, the Company acquired CBRE (the 2001 Merger) pursuant to an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May31, 2001, among the Company, CBRE and Blum CB. Blum CB was merged with and into CBRE, with CBRE being the surviving corporation. The operations of the Company after the 2001 Merger are substantially the same as the operations of CBRE prior to the 2001 Merger. In addition, the Company has no substantive operations other than its investment in CBRE.
CBRE Holding,Inc. is a holding company that conducts its operations primarily through direct and indirect operating subsidiaries. In the United States (US), the Company operates through CB Richard Ellis,Inc. and L.J. Melody, in the United Kingdom (UK) through CB Hillier Parker and in Canada through CB Richard Ellis Limited. CB Richard Ellis Investors,LLC (CBRE Investors) and its foreign affiliates conduct business in the US, Europe and Asia. The Company operates in 47 countries through various subsidiaries and pursuant to cooperation agreements. Approximately 73% of the Company's revenue is generated from the US and 27% is generated from the rest of the world.
2.Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. Additionally, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CBRE prior to the 2001 Merger as CBRE is considered the predecessor to the Company for purposes of RegulationS-X. The equity attributable to minority shareholders' interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company's investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but does not control, are accounted for under the equity method. Accordingly, the Company's share of the earnings of these equity-method basis companies is included in consolidated net income. All other investments held on a long-term basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value.
Use of Estimates The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that these estimates provide a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of its financial condition and results of operations.
44 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months. The Company controls certain cash and cash equivalents as an agent for its investment and property management clients. These amounts are not included in the consolidated balance sheets (See Note17).
Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or in the case of capitalized leases, at the present value of the future minimum lease payments. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging up to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the respective leases, excluding options to renew. The Company capitalizes expenditures that materially increase the life of the related assets and expenses the cost of maintenance and repairs.
The Company periodically reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If any of the significant assumptions inherent in this assessment materially change due to market, economic, and/or other factors, the recoverability is assessed based on the revised assumptions. If this analysis indicates that such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is recognized in the period the changes occur and represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of CBRE at July20, 2001, the date of the 2001 Merger. Other intangible assets include a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Merger, is not being amortized and has an indefinite estimated life. The remaining other intangible assets represent management contracts and loan servicing rights and are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging up to ten years.
The Company fully adopted SFAS No.142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective January1, 2002. This statement requires the Company to perform at least an annual assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives based on assumptions and estimates of fair value and future cash flow information. In June2002, the Company completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test and determined that no impairment existed as of January1, 2002. The Company also completed its required annual impairment test as of October1, 2002 and determined that no impairment existed as of that date. An independent third-party valuation firm was engaged to perform all of the impairment tests (See Note8).
Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred in connection with financing activities are deferred and amortized using the straight-line method over the terms of the related debt agreements ranging up to 10years. Amortization of these costs is charged to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Total deferred costs, net of accumulated amortization, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were $20.5million and $23.3million, as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
45 Revenue Recognition Real estate commissions on sales are recorded as income upon close of escrow or upon transfer of title. Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded as income once the Company satisfies all obligations under the commission agreement. A typical commission agreement provides that the Company earns a portion of the lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant, while the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission is earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy. The existence of any significant future contingencies will result in the delay of recognition of revenue until such contingencies are satisfied. For example, if the Company does not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays their first month's rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, the Company delays revenue recognition until cash rent is paid by the tenant. Investment management and property management fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related agreements. Appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered. Loan origination fees are recognized at the time the loan closes and the Company has no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction, while loan servicing fees are recorded to revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors. Other commissions, consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as income at the time the related services have been performed unless significant future contingencies exist.
In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, the Company makes assumptions with respect to their future collectibility. The Company's assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer's credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances. In addition to these individual assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are greater than 180days are fully provided for.
Business Promotion and Advertising Costs The costs of business promotion and advertising are expensed as incurred in accordance with Statement of Position 93-7, "Reporting on Advertising Costs." Business promotion and advertising costs of $42.4million, $17.0million, $30.4million and $57.0million were included in operating, administrative and other expenses for the twelve months ended December31, 2002, the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001, the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001 and the twelve months ended December31, 2000.
Foreign Currencies The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the US are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rate. The resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations. The aggregate transaction gains and losses included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are a $6.4million gain, a $0.2million loss, a $0.3million gain, and a $3.1million loss for the twelve months ended December31, 2002, the period February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001, the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001 and the twelve months ended December31, 2000, respectively.
46 Comprehensive (Loss) Income Comprehensive (loss) income consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive (loss) income. Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and a minimum pension liability adjustment. Foreign currency translation adjustments exclude income tax expense (benefit) given that earnings of non-US subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time. The income tax benefit associated with the minimum pension liability adjustment is $7.3million for the twelve months ended December31, 2002.
Accounting for Transfers and Servicing The Company follows SFAS No.140, " Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities" in accounting for loan sales and acquisition of servicing rights. SFAS No.140 provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. Those standards are based on consistent application of a financial-components approach that focuses on control. Under the approach, after a transfer of financial assets, an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred at fair value. Servicing assets are amortized over the period of estimated servicing income with write-off required when control is surrendered. The Company's recording of servicing rights at their fair value resulted in gains, which have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Corresponding servicing assets of approximately $2.1million and $1.8million, at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, are included in other intangible assets reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Stock-Based Compensation In December2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure." This statement amends SFAS No.123 , "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No.148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.123 to require prominent disclosures about the effect on reported net income of an entity's accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation. Finally, SFAS No.148 amends APB Opinion No.28, "Interim Financial Reporting," to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. For entities that voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation, the transition and the disclosure provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2002. The amendments to APB No.28 are effective for interim periods beginning after December15, 2002. The Company will adopt the interim disclosure provisions of SFAS No.148 for the quarter ended March31, 2003.
However, the Company continues to account for stock-based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No.25 and does not plan to voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation. Under this method, the Company does not recognize compensation expense for options that were granted at or above the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Had compensation expense been determined consistent with 47 SFAS No.123, the Company's net income (loss) and per share information would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Company Company Predecessor Predecessor CBRE Holding,Inc.

The weighted average fair value of options and warrants granted was $2.33 for the twelve months ended December31, 2002, $1.86 for the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001 and $6.72 for the twelve months ended December31, 2000. There were no stock options or warrants granted by CBRE for the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001. Dividend yield is excluded from the calculation since it is the present intention of the Company to retain all earnings. The fair value of each option grant and warrant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants: Company Company Predecessor CBRE Holding,Inc.

Twelve Months Ended December31, 2002 February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001 Twelve Months Ended December31, 2000 Risk-free interest rate 4.06 % 4.69 % 6.52 % Expected volatility 0.00 % 0.00 % 58.06 % Expected life 5years 5years 5years The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the Company believes the Black-Scholes model does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
48 Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share further assumes the dilutive effect of stock options, stock warrants, contingently issuable shares and other stock-based compensation programs. Contingently issuable shares represent unvested stock fund units in the deferred compensation plan. In accordance with SFAS No.128, " Earnings Per Share " these shares are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method (see Note15).
Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with SFAS No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
New Accounting Pronouncements In June2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No.143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and (or) the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. The statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of its fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. SFAS No.143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2002. Adoption of this statement is not expected to have any material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
In April2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.145, " Rescission of FASB Statements No.4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No.13, and Technical Corrections ." This statement rescinds the following pronouncements:  SFAS No.4, " Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt "  SFAS No.44, " Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers "  SFAS No.64, " Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements " SFAS No.145 amends SFAS No.13, " Accounting for Leases ," to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. This statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions.
The provisions of this statement related to the rescission of SFAS No.4 shall be applied in fiscal years beginning after May15, 2002. The provisions of this statement related to SFAS No.13 shall be effective for transactions occurring after May15, 2002. All other provisions of this statement shall be 49 effective for financial statements issued on or after May15, 2002. Adoption of this statement has not had and is not expected to have any material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
In July2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.146, " Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." This statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan and supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.94.3, " Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity ." SFAS No.146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal plan activities initiated after December31, 2002. The Company will account for such costs, if any, under SFAS No.146 on a prospective basis.
In November2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN)45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," an interpretation of SFAS No.5, "Accounting for Contingencies," SFAS No.57, "Related Party Disclosures" and SFAS No.107, "Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments." This interpretation also rescinds FIN34, "Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN45 expands the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under certain guarantees. The disclosure requirements of FIN45 are effective as of December31, 2002, and require disclosure of the nature of the guarantee, the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee, and the current amount of the liability, if any, for the guarantor's obligations under the guarantee. The recognition requirements of FIN45 are to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002. The adoption of FIN45 has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
In January2003, the FASB issued FIN46, " Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which is an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No.51, "Consolidated Financial Statements." This interpretation addresses consolidation of entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks. The objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity (VIE) and determine when the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and results of operations of a VIE need to be consolidated with its primary beneficiary. A company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company's interest in the VIE is such that the company will absorb a majority of the VIE's expected losses and/or receive a majority of the VIE's expected residual returns, or if the VIE does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. For VIEs in which a significant (but not majority) variable interest is held, certain disclosures are required. The consolidation requirements of FIN46 apply immediately to VIEs created after January31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to existing VIEs in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June15, 2003. Certain disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January31, 2003, regardless of when the VIE was established. The adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications, which do not have an effect on net income, have been made to the 2001 and 2000 financial statements to conform to the 2002 presentation.
50 3.2001 Merger On July20, 2001, the Company acquired CBRE (the 2001 Merger) pursuant to an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May31, 2001 (the 2001 Merger Agreement) among the Company, CBRE and Blum CB. Blum CB was merged with and into CBRE, with CBRE being the surviving corporation. The operations of the Company after the 2001 Merger are substantially the same as the operations of CBRE prior to the 2001 Merger. In addition, the Company has no substantive operations other than its investment in CBRE. As such, CBRE is considered the predecessor to the Company for purposes of RegulationS-X.
At the effective time of the 2001 Merger, CBRE became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the 2001 Merger Agreement, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of CBRE was converted into the right to receive $16.00 in cash, except for: (i)shares of common stock of CBRE owned by the Company and Blum CB immediately prior to the 2001 Merger, totaling 7,967,774 shares, which were cancelled, (ii)treasury shares and shares of common stock of CBRE owned by any of its subsidiaries, which were cancelled and (iii)shares of CBRE held by stockholders who perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Delaware law. All shares of common stock of CBRE outstanding prior to the 2001 Merger were acquired by the Company and subsequently cancelled. Immediately prior to the 2001 Merger, the following, collectively referred to as the buying group, contributed to the Company all the shares of CBRE's common stock that he or it directly owned in exchange for an equal number of shares of ClassB common stock of the Company: Blum Strategic Partners,L.P. (Blum Strategic), formerly known as RCBA Strategic Partners,L.P., FS Equity PartnersIII,L.P. (FSEP III), a Delaware limited partnership, FS Equity Partners International,L.P. (FSEP International), a Delaware limited partnership, The Koll Holding Company, a California corporation, Frederic V. Malek, a director of the Company and CBRE, Raymond E. Wirta, the Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company and CBRE, and Brett White, the President and a director of the Company and CBRE. Such shares of common stock of CBRE, which totaled 7,967,774 shares of common stock, were then cancelled. In addition, the Company offered to purchase for cash options outstanding to acquire common stock of CBRE at a purchase price per option equal to the greater of the amount by which $16.00 exceeded the exercise price of the option, if at all, or $1.00. In connection with the 2001 Merger, CBRE purchased its outstanding options on behalf of the Company, which were recorded as merger-related and other nonrecurring charges by CBRE in the period from January1, 2001 to July20, 2001.
The funding to complete the 2001 Merger, as well as the refinancing of substantially all of the outstanding indebtedness of CBRE, was obtained through: (i)the cash contribution of $74.8million from the sale of ClassB common stock of the Company for $16.00 per share, (ii)the sale of shares of ClassA common stock of the Company for $16.00 per share to employees and independent contractors of CBRE, (iii)the sale of 625,000 shares of ClassA common stock of the Company to the California Public Employees' Retirement System for $16.00 per share, (iv)the issuance and sale by the Company of 65,000 units for $65.0million to DLJ Investment Funding,Inc. and other purchasers, which units consist of $65.0million in aggregate principal amount of 16% Senior Notes due July20, 2011 and 339,820 shares of ClassA common stock of the Company, (v)the issuance and sale by Blum CB of $229.0million in aggregate principal amount of 11 1 / 4 % Senior Subordinated Notes due June15, 2011 for $225.6million (which were assumed by CBRE in connection with the 2001 Merger) and (vi)borrowings by CBRE under a new $325.0million senior credit facility with Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) and other lenders.
Following the 2001 Merger, the common stock of CBRE was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. CBRE also successfully completed a tender offer and consent solicitation for all of the 51 outstanding principal amount of its 8 7 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 (the Subordinated Notes). The Subordinated Notes were purchased at $1,079.14 for each $1,000 principal amount of Subordinated Notes, which included a consent payment of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount of Subordinated Notes. The Company also repaid the outstanding balance of CBRE's existing revolving credit facility. The Company entered into the 2001 Merger in order to enhance the flexibility to operate CBRE's existing businesses and to develop new ones.
4.Purchase Accounting The aggregate finalized purchase price for the acquisition of CBRE was approximately $399.5million, which included: (1)shares of the Company's ClassB common stock, valued at $16.00 per share, and warrants to acquire shares of the Company's ClassB common stock issued to members of the buying group in exchange for shares of common stock of CBRE contributed to the Company immediately prior to the 2001 Merger and the cancellation of warrants to acquire common stock of CBRE; (2)$16.00 per share in cash paid to owners of common stock of CBRE, excluding shares owned by members of the buying group discussed above; (3)allocations in CBRE's deferred compensation plan (the DCP) from vested stock fund units, each of which was valued at $16.00 and which was entitled to one underlying share of CBRE common stock upon distribution from the DCP prior to the 2001 Merger, to other investments alternatives available under the DCP, in each case at the election of the applicable participant; (4)vested stock fund units held in the DCP, each of which was valued at $16.00 and which was converted to the right to receive one underlying share of the Company's ClassA common stock upon distribution from the DCP after the 2001 Merger, that participants elected to continue to hold after the 2001 Merger; (5)unvested stock fund units held in the DCP, each of which was valued at $16.00 and which were automatically converted to the right to receive one underlying share of the Company's ClassA common stock upon distribution from the DCP after the 2001 Merger and (6)direct costs incurred in connection with the 2001 Merger.
The 2001 Merger was accounted for as a purchase by the Company. Prior to the 2001 Merger, no single member of the buying group, nor any combination thereof, controlled CBRE. After the completion of the 2001 Merger, Blum Strategic has control of CBRE. The shares of common stock of CBRE directly owned by Blum Strategic prior to the 2001 Merger, which were included in the shares owned by the buying group contributed to the Company, were valued at Blum Strategic's book value in the determination of the purchase price. All other shares of common stock of CBRE acquired by the Company were accounted for at a fair value of $16.00 per share in the determination of the purchase price. As such, the 2001 Merger was accounted for as a step purchase acquisition in accordance with SFAS No.141, "Business Combinations," and the net assets of CBRE acquired by the Company were adjusted to 86.5% of their estimated fair value.
The preliminary purchase accounting adjustments of the Company were recorded in 2001 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for any periods subsequent to July20, 2001. During 2002, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation, which included finalizing the fair values of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the 2001 Merger date. The excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the finalized fair value of the assets and liabilities of CBRE at the date of the 2001 Merger was approximately $594.9million and is included in goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2002. This represents a $28.3million reduction to what was originally estimated and reported at December31, 2001. This net decrease was mainly due to the adjustment, net of the related tax impact, of certain intangible assets to their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, which were finalized based on independent third party appraisals during 2002 (See Note8 for additional information).
52 5.Basis of Preparation The accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders' equity for the twelve months ended December31, 2002 and for the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001, reflect the consolidated balance sheets, results of operations, cash flows and stockholders' equity of the Company from inception and also include the consolidated financial statements of CBRE from the date of the 2001 Merger, including all material adjustments required under the purchase method of accounting. For purposes of RegulationS-X, CBRE is considered the predecessor to the Company. As such, the historical financial statements of CBRE prior to the 2001 Merger are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders' equity for the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001 and for the twelve months ended December31, 2000 (collectively "Predecessor financial statements"). The Predecessor financial statements have not been adjusted to reflect the acquisition of CBRE by the Company. As such, the consolidated financial statements of the Company after the 2001 Merger are not directly comparable to the Predecessor financial statements prior to the 2001 Merger.
Unaudited pro forma results of the Company, assuming the 2001 Merger had occurred as of January1, 2001, are presented below. These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and include certain adjustments, such as increased interest expense as a result of debt acquired to finance the 2001 Merger. The 2001 proforma information excludes $18.3million of merger-related and other nonrecurring charges. These pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been and may not be indicative of future operating results (dollars in thousands, except share data): Twelve Months Ended December31 2001 Revenue $ 1,170,762 Operating income $ 76,496 Net loss $ (1,640 ) Basic and diluted loss per share $ (0.11 ) Weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted loss per share 15,025,308 6.Acquisitions and Dispositions During 2001, the Company acquired a professional real estate services firm in Mexico for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.7million in cash. The Company also purchased the remaining ownership interests that it did not already own in CB Richard Ellis/Hampshire,L.L.C. for a purchase price of approximately $1.8million in cash.
During 2000, the Company acquired five companies with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.4million in cash, $0.7million in notes, plus additional payments over the next five years based on acquisition earnout agreements. These payments will supplement the purchase price and be recorded as additional goodwill when paid, as applicable. The most significant acquisition in 2000 was the purchase of Boston Mortgage Capital Corporation (Boston Mortgage) by L.J. Melody for approximately $2.1million, plus supplemental payments based on an acquisition earnout agreement. Boston Mortgage provides further mortgage banking penetration into the northeastern part of the US.
53 It services approximately $1.8billion in loans covering roughly 175 commercial properties throughout New England, New York and New Jersey.
In February2000, the Company sold certain non-strategic assets for cash proceeds of $8.4million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $4.7million.
7.Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of the following (dollars in thousands): December31 2002 2001 Leasehold improvements $ 20,000 $ 19,710 Furniture and equipment 116,268 126,864 Equipment under capital leases 13,925 27,541 150,193 174,115 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (83,559 ) (105,664 ) Property and equipment, net $ 66,634 $ 68,451 Depreciation expense was $20.8million for the twelve months ended December31, 2002, $9.1million for the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001, $12.6million for the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001 and $19.2million for the twelve months ended December31, 2000.
8.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets In June2001, the FASB issued SFAS No.141, " Business Combinations, " and SFAS No.142, " Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
" SFAS No.141 replaces APB Opinion No.16, "Business Combinations," and requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001. It also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets. Under SFAS No.142, goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but are subject to impairment tests, on an annual basis, at a minimum, or whenever events or circumstances occur indicating goodwill might be impaired. SFAS No.142 also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and be reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No.144, " Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." The Company adopted SFAS No.141 for all business combinations completed after June30, 2001 and fully adopted SFAS No.142 effective January1, 2002. The Company identified its reporting units and determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those units for purposes of performing the required transitional goodwill impairment assessment.
In June2002, the Company completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test which entailed comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company determined that no impairment existed at the effective date of the implementation of the new standard. The Company also completed its required annual goodwill impairment test as of October1, 2002 and determined that no impairment existed as of that date.
54 Had the Company accounted for goodwill consistent with the provisions of SFAS No.142 in prior periods, the Company's net income (loss) would have been affected as follows (dollars in thousands, except share data): Company Company Predecessor Predecessor CBRE Holding, Inc.

CB Richard Ellis Services,Inc., the Predecessor Option Plans and Warrants.
At the effective time of the 2001 Merger, each holder of an option to acquire CBRE's common stock, whether or not vested, had the right to receive, in consideration for the cancellation of his or her options, an amount per share of common stock equal to the greater of (i)the amount by which $16.00 exceeded the exercise price of the option, if any, or (ii)$1.00 reduced in each case by applicable withholding taxes.

In 1994, CBRE implemented the DCP. Under the DCP, a select group of management and highly compensated employees can defer the payment of all or a portion of their compensation (including any bonus). The DCP permits participating employees to 59 make an irrevocable election at the beginning of each year to receive at some future date these deferred amounts invested in interest bearing accounts, which are an unsecured liability of the Company, in shares of common stock of the Company, where elections are recorded to additional paid-in capital or in insurance products which function like mutual funds. The Company has elected to fund a portion of its obligation for deferrals in these insurance products, but is not obligated to do so in the future.
As part of the 2001 Merger, the DCP was amended so that each stock fund unit was converted to the right to receive one share of ClassA common stock of the Company. Each participant in the DCP who was a US employee or an independent contractor in specified states and had vested stock fund units prior to the 2001 Merger was permitted to make one of the following elections: (i)convert the value of his or her vested stock fund units, based upon the value of $16.00 per stock unit, into any of the insurance mutual fund alternatives or the Interest Index Fund II provided under the DCP, (ii)continue to hold the vested stock fund units in his or her account under the DCP or (iii)transfer amounts invested in insurance mutual fund alternatives into DCP stock fund units. In accordance with a change in control provision included in the terms of the DCP, stock fund units associated with the 1999 Company matching contribution, which were unvested prior to the 2001 Merger, became vested upon completion of the 2001 Merger, but remained as stock fund units.
Each stock fund unit that was unvested prior to the 2001 Merger remained in participants' accounts, but after the 2001 Merger was converted to the right to receive one share of ClassA common stock of the Company. These unvested stock fund units have been accounted for as a deferred compensation asset. The deferred compensation asset will be amortized as compensation expense over the remaining vesting period for such stock fund units in accordance with FASB Interpretation No.44, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation," with $1.8million charged to compensation expense for the twelve months ended December31, 2002 and $0.9million charged to compensation expense for the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001. The accompanying consolidated balance sheets include the unamortized balances totaling $1.9million and $1.4million in other current assets and other assets, respectively, as of December31, 2002. Subsequent to the 2001 Merger, no new deferrals are allowed in stock fund units.
In 2001, the Company announced a match for the Plan Year 2000, effective July2001, in the amount of $8.0million to be invested in an interest bearing account on behalf of participants. The 2000 Company Match vests at 20% per year, and will be fully vested by December2005. The related compensation expense will be amortized over the vesting period. The amounts charged to expense for the 2000 Company match were $1.7million for the twelve months ended December31, 2002, $0.7million for the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001 and $0.2million for the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001.
Included in the Company's accompanying consolidated balance sheets is the accumulated non-stock liability of $106.3million and $105.1million at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and the assets (in the form of insurance) set aside to cover the liability of $63.6million and $69.4million as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, the Company's deferred stock liability, included in additional paid-in capital, totaled $18.2million and $18.8million at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Stock Purchase Plans.
Prior to the 2001 Merger, CBRE had restricted stock purchase plans covering select key executives including senior management. A total of 500,000 and 550,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under CBRE's 1999 and 1996 Equity Incentive Plans, respectively. The shares were issued to senior executives for a purchase price equal to the greater of 60 $18.00 and $10.00 per share or fair market value, respectively. The purchase price for these shares was paid either in cash or by delivery of a full recourse promissory note. All promissory notes related to the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan were repaid as part of the 2001 Merger. The majority of the notes related to the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan were also repaid, with the remaining unpaid outstanding balances of $0.6million and $1.0million as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, included in notes receivable from sale of stock in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders' equity. As part of the 2001 Merger, the CBRE shares related to these outstanding promissory notes were exchanged for shares of ClassB common stock of the Company.
Bonuses.
The Company has bonus programs covering select key employees, including senior management. Awards are based on the position and performance of the employee and the achievement of pre-established financial, operating and strategic objectives. The amounts charged to expense for bonuses were $40.2million for the twelve months ended December31, 2002, $18.0million for the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001, $16.5million for the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001 and $49.8million for the twelve months ended December31, 2000.
Capital Accumulation Plan (the Cap Plan).
The Cap Plan is a defined contribution profit sharing plan under Section401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and is the Company's only such plan. Generally, a US employee of the Company is eligible to participate in the plan if the employee is at least 21years old. The Cap Plan provides for participant contributions as well as discretionary employer contributions. A participant is allowed to contribute to the Cap Plan from 1% to 15%, in whole percentages of his or her compensation, subject to limits imposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Each year, the Company determines the amount of employer contributions, if any, it will contribute to the Cap Plan based on the performance and profitability of the Company's consolidated U.S. operations. The Company's contributions for the year are allocated to participants who are actively employed on the last day of the plan year in proportion to each participant's pre-tax contributions for that year, up to 5% of the participant's compensation. In connection with the Cap Plan, the Company incurred no expense for the twelve months ended December31, 2002, $0.8million for the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001, no expense for the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001 and $2.2million for the twelve months ended December31, 2000.
In connection with the 2001 Merger, each share of common stock of CBRE formerly held by the Cap Plan and credited to participant accounts was exchanged for $16.00 in cash. In addition, the Cap Plan was amended to eliminate the common stock of CBRE as an investment option within the Cap Plan after July20, 2001. The cash received for the shares of CBRE common stock was available for reinvestment in one or more of the investment alternatives available within the Cap Plan in accordance with the terms of the plan, including a new company stock fund in which employees could invest on a one-time basis in ClassA shares of common stock of the Company. Subsequent to the 2001 Merger, participants are no longer entitled to purchase additional shares of CBRE Holding ClassA or ClassB common stock for allocation to their account balance.
Pension Plan.
The Company, through the acquisition of Hillier Parker in the UK, maintains a contributory defined benefit pension plan to provide retirement benefits to existing and former Hillier Parker employees participating in the plan. It is the Company's policy to fund the minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations. Pension expense totaled $3.6million for the twelve months ended December31, 2002, $1.4million for the period February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001, $0.9million for the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001 and $0.9million for the twelve months ended December31, 2000.
61 As a result of the plan's under-funded status in 2002, the Company recorded a charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of the related deferred tax impact, appropriately eliminating the prepaid pension asset and establishing a minimum liability for under-funding. This non-cash charge had no impact on net income or cash flow.

The Company issued $229.0million in aggregate principal amount of 11 1 / 4 % Senior Subordinated Notes due June15, 2011 (the Notes), which were issued and sold by Blum CB Corp. for approximately $225.6million, net of discount, on June7, 2001 and assumed by CBRE in connection with the 2001 Merger. The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Company 64 and its domestic subsidiaries. The Notes require semi-annual payments of interest in arrears on June15 and December15, having commenced on December15, 2001, and are redeemable in whole or in part on or after June15, 2006 at 105.625% of par on that date and at declining prices thereafter. In addition, before June15, 2004, the Company may redeem up to 35.0% of the originally issued amount of the Notes at 111 1 / 4 % of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, solely with the net cash proceeds from public equity offerings. In the event of a change of control, the Company is obligated to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a redemption price of 101.0% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The Company also entered into a $325.0million Senior Credit Facility (the Credit Facility) with CSFB and other lenders. The Credit Facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of their assets. The Credit Facility includes the Tranche A term facility of $50.0million, maturing on July20, 2007; the Tranche B term facility of $185.0million, maturing on July18, 2008; and the revolving line of credit of $90.0million, including revolving credit loans, letters of credit and a swingline loan facility, maturing on July20, 2007. Borrowings under the Tranche A and revolving facility bear interest at varying rates based on the Company's option at either three-month LIBOR plus 2.50% to 3.25% or the alternate base rate plus 1.50% to 2.25% as determined by reference to the Company's ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA, which is defined in the debt agreement. Borrowings under the Tranche B facility bear interest at varying rates based on the Company's option at either three-month LIBOR plus 3.75% or the alternate base rate plus 2.75%. The alternate base rate is the higher of (1)CSFB's prime rate or (2)the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus one-half of one percent.
The Tranche A facility will be repaid by July20, 2007 through quarterly principal payments over six years, which total $7.5million each year through June30, 2003 and $8.75million each year thereafter through July20, 2007. The Tranche B facility requires quarterly principal payments of approximately $0.5million, with the remaining outstanding principal due on July18, 2008. The revolving line of credit requires the repayment of any outstanding balance for a period of 45 consecutive days commencing on any day in the month of December of each year as determined by the Company. The Company repaid its revolving credit facility as of November5, 2002 and December1, 2001 and at December31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had no revolving line of credit principal outstanding.
The Company issued an aggregate principal amount of $65.0million of 16.0% Senior Notes due on July20, 2011 (the Senior Notes). The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations, senior to all current and future unsecured indebtedness, but subordinated to all current and future secured indebtedness of the Company. Interest accrues at a rate of 16.0% per year and is payable quarterly in cash in arrears. Interest may be paid in kind to the extent CBRE's ability to pay cash dividends is restricted by the terms of the Credit Facility. Additionally, interest in excess of 12.0% may, at the Company's option, be paid in kind through July2006. The Company elected to pay in kind interest in excess of 12.0%, or 4.0%, that was payable on April20, 2002, July20, 2002 and October20, 2002. The Senior Notes are redeemable at the Company's option, in whole or in part, at 116.0% of par commencing on July20, 2001 and at declining prices thereafter. As of December31, 2002, the redemption price was 112.8% of par. In the event of a change in control, the Company is obligated to make an offer to purchase all of the outstanding Senior Notes at 101.0% of par.
The Senior Notes are solely the Company's obligation to repay. CBRE has neither guaranteed nor pledged any of its assets as collateral for the Senior Notes and is not obligated to provide cashflow to the Company for repayment of these Senior Notes. However, the Company has no substantive assets or operations other than its investment in CBRE to meet any required principal and interest payments on 65 the Senior Notes. The Company will depend on CBRE's cash flows to fund principal and interest payments as they come due.
The Notes, the Credit Facility and the Senior Notes all contain numerous restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or distributions to stockholders, repurchase capital stock or debt, make investments, sell assets or subsidiary stock, engage in transactions with affiliates, issue subsidiary equity and enter into consolidations or mergers. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of interest and certain fixed charges and a maximum leverage and senior leverage ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to funded debt. The Credit Facility requires the Company to pay a facility fee based on the total amount of the unused commitment.
The Company has short-term borrowings of $111.1million and $155.6million with related weighted average interest rates of 3.9% and 4.5% as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
A subsidiary of the Company has a credit agreement with Residential Funding Corporation (RFC) for the purpose of funding mortgage loans that will be resold. The credit agreement in 2001 initially provided for a revolving line of credit of $150.0million, bore interest at the greater of one-month LIBOR or 3.0% (RFC Base Rate), plus 1.0%, and expired on August31, 2001. Through various executed amendments and extension letters in 2001, the revolving line of credit was increased to $350.0million and the maturity date was extended to January22, 2002.
Effective January23, 2002, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Warehousing Credit and Security Agreement. This agreement provided for a revolving line of credit in the amount of $350.0million until February28, 2002 and $150.0million for the period from March1, 2002 through August31, 2002. Additionally, on February1, 2002, the Company executed a Letter Agreement with RFC that redefined the RFC Base Rate to the greater of one-month LIBOR or 2.25% per annum. On April20, 2002, the Company obtained a temporary revolving line of credit increase of $210.0million that resulted in a total line of credit equaling $360.0million, which expired on July31, 2002. Upon expiration of the temporary increase and through various executed amendments and extension letter agreements, the Company established a revolving line of credit of $200.0million, redefined the RFC Base Rate to the greater of one-month LIBOR or 2.0% and extended the maturity date of the agreement to December20, 2002. On December16, 2002, the Company entered into the Third Amended and Restated Warehousing Credit and Security Agreement effective December20, 2002. The agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of $200.0million, bears interest at the RFC Base Rate plus 1.0% and expires on August31, 2003.
During the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, the Company had a maximum of $309.0million and $164.0million revolving line of credit principal outstanding with RFC. At December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, the Company had a $63.1million and a $106.8million warehouse line of credit outstanding, which are included in short-term borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the Company had a $63.1million and a $106.8million warehouse receivable, which are also included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
A subsidiary of the Company has a credit agreement with JP Morgan Chase. The credit agreement provides for a non-recourse revolving line of credit of up to $20.0million, bears interest at 1.0% of the bank's cost of funds and expires on May28, 2003. At December31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had no revolving line of credit principal outstanding.
66 During 2001, the Company incurred $37.2million of non-recourse debt through a joint venture. In September2002, the maturity date on this non-recourse debt was extended to June18, 2003.
13.Commitments and Contingencies The Company is a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, its ordinary course of business. Management believes that any liability that may result from disposition of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
The following is a schedule by year of future minimum lease payments for noncancelable leases as of December31, 2002 (dollars in thousands): Capital Leases Operating Leases 2003 $ 731 $ 66,632 2004 29 58,320 2005 9 50,966 2006 4 42,924 2007 3 35,090 Thereafter  233,379 Total minimum payments required $ 776 $ 487,311 The interest portion of capital lease payments represents the amount necessary to reduce net minimum lease payments to present value calculated at the Company's incremental borrowing rate at the inception of the leases. This totaled approximately $.01million at December31, 2002, resulting in a present value of net minimum lease payments of $.76million. At December31, 2002, $.72million and $.04million were included in current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt, respectively. In addition, the total minimum payments for noncancelable operating leases were not reduced by the minimum sublease rental income of $4.3million due in the future under noncancelable subleases.
Substantially all leases require the Company to pay maintenance costs, insurance and property taxes, and generally may be renewed for five-year periods. The composition of total rental expense under noncancelable operating leases consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): Company Company Predecessor Predecessor CBRE Holding, Inc.

A 100% participation in the 67 loan portfolio was sold to Fannie Mae with the Company retaining the credit risk on the first 2% of losses incurred on the underlying portfolio of commercial mortgage loans. The Company has collateralized a portion of its obligation to cover the first 1% of losses through a letter of credit in favor of Fannie Mae for a total of approximately $1.0million.
At December31, 2002, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $7.8million, including the Fannie Mae letter of credit discussed in the preceding paragraph. The letters of credit expire at varying dates through December2004.
An important part of the strategy for the Company's investment management business involves investing the Company's own capital in certain real estate investments with its clients. These co-investments typically range from 2% to 5% of the equity in a particular fund. As of December31, 2002, the Company had committed an additional $22.6million to fund future co-investments.

The international component of income (loss) before provision for income taxes was $17.8million for the twelve months ended December31, 2002, $12.9million for the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001, $(9.9) million for the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001 and $4.9million for the twelve months ended December31, 2000.
Cumulative tax effects of temporary differences are shown below at December31, 2002 and 2001 (dollars in thousands): December31 2002 2001 Asset (Liability) Property and equipment $ 10,960 $ 16,665 Bad debts and other reserves 12,459 10,225 Intangible amortization (26,065 ) (2,311 ) Bonus, unexercised restricted stock, deferred compensation 57,780 53,418 Investment 4,189 5,045 Net operating loss (NOL) and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 5 3,778 Unconsolidated affiliates 5,283 7,568 Pension obligation 7,303  All other, net (2,923 ) 3,312 Net deferred tax asset before valuation allowances 68,991 97,700 Valuation allowances (13,892 ) (11,543 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 55,099 $ 86,157 69 The Company had no federal income tax NOLs at December31, 2002.
Management has determined that as of December31, 2002, $13.9million of deferred tax assets do not satisfy the recognition criteria set forth in SFAS No.109. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for this amount. Approximately $13.1million of this valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets acquired in the 2001 Merger. Accordingly, goodwill will be reduced at such time as these deferred tax assets are realized.
A deferred US tax liability has not been provided on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is the intent of the Company to permanently reinvest these earnings. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which have been, or are intended to be, permanently invested in accordance with APB No.23, " Accounting for Income TaxesSpecial Areas ," aggregated $52.0million at December31, 2002. The determination of the tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
15.Stockholders' Equity The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, including 75,000,000 shares of ClassA common stock and 25,000,000 shares of ClassB common stock, both with $0.01 par value per share. The holders of ClassA common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. Holders of ClassB common stock are entitled to ten votes for each share. There are no differences between the two classes of common stock other than number of votes. The holders of ClassA and ClassB common stock shall share equally on a per-share basis all dividends and other cash, stock or property distributions.
Upon written request of any holder of ClassB common stock, any shares will be automatically converted on a share-for-share basis into the same number of shares of ClassA common stock. In addition, upon any transfer, sale, or other disposition of the Company, shares of ClassB common stock shall be converted into shares of ClassA common stock on a share-for-share basis, excluding the transfer to certain permitted ClassB common stockholders. Also, upon completion of an underwritten public offering in which the Company becomes listed on a national securities exchange, all outstanding shares of ClassB common stock shall automatically be converted into shares of ClassA common stock on a share-for-share basis.
As long as ClassB common stock is outstanding, if a holder of ClassB common stock purchases any shares of ClassA common stock, the holder may convert the ClassA common shares on a share-for-share basis into the same number of shares of ClassB common stock.

17.Fiduciary Funds The accompanying consolidated balance sheets do not include the net assets of escrow, agency and fiduciary funds, which amounted to $414.6million and $373.2million at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
72 18.Fair Value of Financial Instruments SFAS No.107, " Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, " requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Value is defined as the amount at which an instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The fair value estimates of financial instruments are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company might pay or receive in actual market transactions. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Includes cash and cash equivalents with maturities of less than three months. The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
Short-Term Borrowings: The majority of this balance represents the warehouse line of credit and non recourse debt related to a property held for sale. Due to their short-term maturities and variable interest rates, fair value approximates carrying value (See Note12).
Senior Subordinated Notes: Based on dealers' quotes, the estimated fair value of the Company's 11 1 / 4 % Senior Subordinated Notes is $208.4million and $199.5million at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Their actual carrying value totaled $225.9million and $225.7million at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively (See Note12).
16% Senior Notes: There was no trading activity for the 16% Senior Notes, which are due in 2011. Their carrying value totaled $61.9million and $59.7million at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively (see Note12).
Senior Secured Terms Loans& Other Long-Term Debt: Estimated fair values approximate respective carrying values because the majority of these instruments are based on variable interest rates (see Note12).
19.Nonrecurring Charges During the period from February20, 2001 (inception) through December31, 2001, the Company recorded nonrecurring pre-tax charges totaling $6.4million which mainly related to the write-off of e-business investments. During the period from January1, 2001 through July20, 2001, CBRE recorded merger-related and other nonrecurring charges of $22.1million, which included merger-related costs incurred of $16.4million, severance costs incurred of $2.8million related to CBRE's cost reduction program implemented in May2001, as well as the write-off of an e-investment of $2.9million.
20.Guarantor and Nonguarantor Financial Statements In connection with the 2001 Merger with Blum CB and as part of the financing of the 2001 Merger, CBRE assumed an aggregate of $229.0million in Senior Subordinated Notes (the Notes) due June15, 2011. These Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company's future senior subordinated unsecured indebtedness. The Notes are effectively subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the Notes. The Notes are guaranteed on a full, unconditional, joint and several basis by the Company, CBRE and CBRE's wholly owned domestic subsidiaries.

22.Related Party Transactions Included in other current and long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are employee loans of $5.9million and $1.6million as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The majority of these loans represent prepaid retention and recruitment awards issued to employees at varying principal amounts, bear interest at rates up to 10.0% per annum and mature on various dates through 2007. These loans and related interest are typically forgiven over time, assuming that the relevant employee is still employed by, and is in good standing with, the Company. As of December31, 2002, the outstanding employee loan balances included a $0.3million loan to Raymond Wirta, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and a $0.2million loan to Brett White, the Company's President. These non-interest bearing loans to Mr.Wirta and Mr.White were issued during 2002 and are due and payable on December31, 2003.
The accompanying consolidated balance sheets also include $4.8million and $5.9million of notes receivable from sale of stock as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These notes are primarily composed of full-recourse loans to employees, officers and certain shareholders of the Company, which are secured by the Company's common stock that is owned by the borrowers. These full-recourse loans are at varying principal amounts, require quarterly interest payments, bear interest at rates up to 10.0% per annum and mature on various dates through 2010.
Pursuant to the Company's 1996Equity Incentive Plan (EIP), Mr.Wirta purchased 30,000shares of CBRE common stock in 2000 at a purchase price of $12.875 per share that was paid for by delivery of a full recourse promissory note bearing interest at 7.40%. As part of the 2001Merger, the 30,000shares of CBRE common stock were exchanged for 30,000shares of ClassB common stock of the Company. These shares of ClassB common stock were substituted for the CBRE shares as security for the promissory note. All interest charged on the outstanding promissory note balance for any year is forgiven if Mr.Wirta's performance warrants a high enough level of bonus (approximately $7,500 of interest is forgiven for each $10,000 of bonus). As a result of bonuses paid in 2001 and in 2002, all interest on Mr.Wirta's promissory note for 2000 and 2001 was forgiven. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, Mr.Wirta had an outstanding loan balance of $385,950, which is included in notes receivable from sale of common stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Pursuant to the Company's 1996EIP, Mr.White purchased 25,000 shares of CBRE common stock in 1998 at a purchase price of $38.50 per share and 20,000 shares of CBRE common stock in 2000 at a purchase price of $12.875 per share. These purchases were paid for by delivery of full recourse promissory notes bearing interest at 7.40%. As part of the 2001Merger, Mr.White's shares of CBRE common stock were exchanged for a like amount of shares of ClassB common stock of the Company. These shares of ClassB common stock were substituted for the CBRE shares as security for the notes. A First Amendment to Mr.White's 1998 promissory note provided that the portion of the then 87 outstanding principal in excess of the fair market value of the shares would be forgiven in the event that Mr.White was an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries on November16, 2002 and the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock was less than $38.50 on November16, 2002. Mr.White's 1998 promissory note was subsequently amended, terminating the First Amendment and adjusting the original 1998 Stock Purchase Agreement by reducing the purchase price from $38.50 to $16.00. During 2002, the 25,000shares held as security for the Second Amended Promissory Note were tendered as full payment for the remaining balance of $400,000 on the 1998 promissory note. All interest charged on the outstanding promissory note balances for any year is forgiven if Mr.White's performance warrants a high enough level of bonus (approximately $7,500 of interest is forgiven for each $10,000 of bonus). As a result of bonuses paid in 2001 and in 2002, all interest on Mr.White's promissory notes for 2000 and 2001 was forgiven. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, Mr.White had outstanding loan balances of $257,300 and $657,300, which are included in notes receivable from sale of common stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
As of December31, 2002 and 2001, Mr.White had an outstanding loan of $164,832, which is included in notes receivable from sale of common stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. This outstanding loan relates to the acquisition of 12,500 shares of CBRE's common stock prior to the 2001 Merger. Subsequent to the 2001 Merger, these shares were converted into shares in the Company's common stock and the related loan amount was carried forward. This loan bears interest at 6.0% and is payable at the earlier of: (i)October14, 2003, (ii)the date of the sale of shares held by the Company pursuant to the related security agreement or (iii)the date of the termination of Mr.White's employment.
At the time of the 2001 Merger, Mr.Wirta delivered to the Company an $80,000 promissory note, which bore interest at 10% per year, as payment for the purchase of 5,000 shares of the Company's ClassB common stock. Mr.Wirta repaid this promissory note in full in April of 2002. Additionally, Mr.Wirta and Mr.White delivered full-recourse notes in the amounts of $512,504 and $209,734, respectively, as payment for a portion of the shares purchased in connection with the 2001 Merger. During 2002, Mr.Wirta paid down his loan amount by $40,004 and Mr.White paid off his note in its entirety. As of December31, 2002, Mr.Wirta has an outstanding loan of $472,500, which is included in notes receivable from sale of common stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
In the event that the Company's common stock is not freely tradable on a national securities exchange or an over-the-counter market by June2004, the Company has agreed to loan Mr.Wirta up to $3.0million on a full-recourse basis to enable him to exercise an existing option to acquire shares held by The Koll Holding Company, if Mr.Wirta is employed by the Company at the time of exercise, was terminated without cause or resigned for good reason. This loan will become repayable upon the earliest to occur of: (1)90days following termination of his employment, other than by the Company without cause or by him for good reason, (2)seven months following the date the Company's common stock becomes freely tradable as described above or (3)the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the pledged shares. This loan will bear interest at the prime rate in effect on the date of the loan, compounded annually, and will be repayable to the extent of any net proceeds received by Mr.Wirta upon the sale of any shares of the Company's common stock. Mr.Wirta will pledge the shares received upon exercise of the option as security for the loan.
23.Subsequent Event On February17, 2003, the Company, CBRE, Apple Acquisition Corp. (the Merger Sub) and Insignia Financial Group,Inc. (Insignia) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Insignia Acquisition Agreement). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Insignia Acquisition 88 Agreement, the Merger Sub will merge with and into Insignia, the separate existence of the Merger Sub will cease and Insignia will continue its existence as a wholly owned subsidiary of CBRE (the Insignia Acquisition).
When the Insignia Acquisition becomes effective, each outstanding share of common stock of Insignia (other than the cancelled shares, dissenting shares and shares held by wholly owned subsidiaries of Insignia) will be converted into the right to receive $11.00 in cash, without interest, from the Merger Sub, subject to adjustments as provided in the Insignia Acquisition. At the same time, each outstanding share of common stock of the Merger Sub will be converted into one share of common stock of the surviving entity in the Insignia Acquisition.
As of February17, 2003, the transaction was valued at approximately $415.0million, including the repayment of net debt and the redemption of preferred stock. In addition to Insignia shareholder approval, the transaction, which is expected to close in June2003, is subject to the receipt of financing and regulatory approvals. The sale by Insignia on March14, 2003 of its residential real estate services subsidiaries, Insignia Douglas Elliman LLC and Insignia Residential Group, Inc., to Montauk Battery Realty, LLC and Insignia's receipt of the cash proceeds from such sale will not affect the consideration to be paid in the Insignia Acquisition.

(2) With respect to Other Annual Compensation paid in 2000, the amounts listed include a $12,000 automobile allowance. For Messrs.Wirta and White, such amounts also include interest accrued and forgiven under the promissory notes delivered by them pursuant to the Company's 1996 Equity Incentive Plan (the "EIP").
(3) Pursuant to the Company's 1996 EIP, Mr.White purchased 25,000 shares of CBRE common stock in 1998 for a purchase price of $38.50 per share and 20,000 shares of CBRE common stock in 2000 for a purchase price of $12.875 per share. These purchases were paid for by the delivery of full recourse promissory notes. A First Amendment to Mr.White's 1998 Promissory Note provided that the portion of the then outstanding principal in excess of the fair market value of the shares would be forgiven in the event that Mr.White was an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries on November16, 2002 and the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock was less than $38.50 on November16, 2002. Mr.White's Promissory Note was subsequently amended, terminating the First Amendment and adjusting the original 1998 Stock Purchase Agreement by reducing the purchase price from $38.50 to $16.00. The 25,000 shares held as security for the Second Amended Promissory Note were tendered as full payment for this note. The remaining note delivered by Mr.White bears interest at 7.40%. As part of the 2001 Merger, the 20,000 shares of CBRE common stock purchased by Mr.White were exchanged for 20,000 shares of ClassB common stock of the Company, which shares were substituted for CBRE shares as security for the note. Pursuant to the 1996 EIP, Mr.Wirta purchased 30,000 shares of CBRE common stock in 2000 at a purchase price of $12.875 paid for by the delivery of a full recourse promissory note bearing interest at 7.40%. As part of the 2001 Merger, the 30,000 shares of CBRE common stock were exchanged for 30,000 shares of ClassB common stock of the Company, which shares were substituted for CBRE shares as security for the note. All interest charged on the outstanding promissory note balances for any year is forgiven if the executive's performance produces a high enough level of bonus (approximately $7,500 of interest is forgiven for each $10,000 of bonus). As a result of bonuses paid in 2001 and 2002, all interest on Mr.White's and Mr.Wirta's promissory notes for 2000 and 2001 was forgiven.
(4) In connection with the 2001 Merger, the Company awarded cash retention bonuses to Messrs.Wirta, White and Leonetti to provide an incentive and reward for continued service up to and including the 2001 Merger. At the effective time of the 2001 Merger, Messrs.Wirta, White and Leonetti also received for each of their options to purchase shares of CBRE common stock, the greater of (A)the amount by which $16.00 exceeded the exercise price of the option, if any, and (B)$1.00. In connection with the 2001 Merger, Mr.Leonetti received payments pursuant to his employment agreement.

Wirta   35,231 140,922   Brett White   28,356 113,426   Kenneth J. Kay    62,000   Incentive Plans CB Richard Ellis Services' Deferred Compensation Plan.
CB Richard Ellis Services' deferred compensation plan permits a select group of management employees, as well as other highly compensated employees, to elect, immediately prior to the beginning of each calendar year, to defer receipt of some or all of their compensation for the next year until a future distribution date and have it credited to one or more of several funds in the deferred compensation plan. From time to time CB Richard Ellis Services has also granted deferred compensation awards in connection with its incentive programs. The three funds in which deferred compensation amounts may be credited are:  The Insurance Fund. A participant may elect to have his or her deferred compensation allocated to the Insurance Fund. Within the Insurance Fund, the employee can elect to have gains or losses on deferrals measured by one or more of approximately 30 mutual funds. CB Richard Ellis Services hedges its obligations to the participants under the Insurance Fund by buying a contract of insurance within which it has premiums invested in the mutual funds which participants have elected to measure the value of their deferred compensation. Historically, CB Richard Ellis Services has held the insurance contract in a Rabbi Trust. The participants, as general unsecured creditors of CB Richard Ellis Services, have no interest in or claim to the Rabbi Trust, the insurance contract or the mutual funds within the insurance contract. The insurance contract and the Rabbi Trust are assets of CB Richard Ellis Services and are available to its general creditors, including the deferred compensation plan participants, in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of CB Richard Ellis Services. While in the past CB Richard Ellis Services has elected to deposit in the Rabbi Trust the full amount of deferrals into the Insurance Fund, CB Richard Ellis Services is not obligated to do so in the future, and CB Richard Ellis Services anticipates that any future funding will be limited so that it maintains cash equal to the 95 incremental tax it must pay because deferred compensation plan allocations are not deductible for tax purposes.
The Stock Fund. A participant may elect to have his or her deferrals allocated to CB Richard Ellis Services' stock fund. After the effective date of the 2001 Merger, no new deferrals are allowed in stock fund units.
The Interest Index Funds. From the deferred compensation plan's inception in 1994 until May 1999, participants could elect to have their deferrals allocated to an Interest Index Fund, which CB Richard Ellis Services refers to as "Interest Index Fund I." All of these allocations were credited with interest at the rate payable by CB Richard Ellis Services under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities. Effective June1, 2001 a new Interest Index Fund, which CB Richard Ellis Services refers to as "Interest Index Fund II," was established. All deferrals allocated to Interest Index Fund II are credited with interest at 11 1 / 4 % per year for five years or until distributed if earlier, and after that time at a rate no lower than the rate CB Richard Ellis Services pays under its principal credit agreement. The deferrals to Interest Index Fund II will not be funded with a Rabbi Trust or otherwise. Interest Index Fund II will only accept up to $20million in deferrals, other than pursuant to the 2000 Company Match Program. A participant may elect to move allocations from the Insurance Fundbut not the Stock Fund or Interest Index Fund Iinto Interest Index Fund II. After five years, CB Richard Ellis Services reserves the right to terminate Interest Index Fund II. In the event that Interest Index FundII is terminated, a participant's account balance in Interest Fund II either will be distributed in cash to the participant or invested in the Insurance Fund. If a participant's account balance in Interest Index Fund II is to be invested in the Insurance Fund, CB Richard Ellis Services will transfer cash equal to the account balance into the Rabbi Trust for the Insurance Fund. The choice between a cash distribution and a new investment in the Insurance Fund is that of the participant, but the choice must be made prior to January1, 2003. Any participant that did not make a choice prior to January1, 2003, will be deemed to have elected a cash distribution.
Distributions.
The deferred compensation plan permits participants to elect in-service distributions, which may not begin less than three years following the election and post-employment distributions. These distributions may be (i)in the form of a lump sum payment on a date selected by the participant or (ii)in a series of quarterly installment payments or annual installment payments in the case of stock fund units. Stock fund units are distributed only in the form of shares of CBRE Holding ClassA common stock. Separate distribution elections are permitted with respect to the deferrals for each year. There is limited flexibility to change distribution elections once made. A participant may elect to receive a distribution of his or her vested accounts at any time subject to a charge equal to 7.5% of the amount to be distributed.
CB Richard Ellis Services' Capital Accumulation Plan.
CB Richard Ellis Services maintains a Capital Accumulation Plan, which is a tax qualified retirement plan that CB Richard Ellis Services generally refers to as the 401(k) plan. Generally, an employee of CB Richard Ellis Services is eligible to participate in the plan if the employee is at least 21years old. The plan provides for participant contributions as well as discretionary employer contributions. A participant is allowed to contribute to the plan from 1% to 15%, in whole percentages, of his or her compensation, subject to limits imposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Each year, CB Richard Ellis Services determines an amount of employer contributions, if any, it will contribute to the plan, which CB Richard Ellis Services refers to as "CB Richard Ellis Services' contributions," based on the performance and profitability of CB Richard Ellis Services' consolidated U.S. operations. CB Richard Ellis Services' contributions for a year are allocated to participants who are actively employed 96 on the last day of the plan year in proportion to each participant's pre-tax contributions for that year, up to 5% of the participant's compensation.
In connection with the 2001 Merger, each share of common stock of CB Richard Ellis Services formerly held by the Capital Accumulation Plan and credited to participant accounts was exchanged for $16.00 in cash. Additionally, the plan was amended to eliminate common stock of CB Richard Ellis Services as an investment option within the plan. The cash received for the shares of CB Richard Ellis Services' common stock was available for reinvestment in one or more of the investment alternatives contained within the plan in accordance with the terms of the plan, including CBRE Holding ClassA common stock, under a new plan investment alternative. All of CB Richard Ellis Services' active U.S. employees participating in the plan at the time of the 2001 Merger were offered the opportunity to direct the trustee of the 401(k) plan to purchase, for allocation to their account balance, shares of CBRE Holding ClassA common stock. Subsequent to the 2001 Merger, participants are no longer entitled to purchase additional shares of CBRE Holding ClassA common stock for allocation to their account balance.
A participant may elect to receive a distribution in a single lump sum payment of his or her Capital Accumulation Plan account balance following termination of the participant's employment with CB Richard Ellis Services. However, if the participant has an account balance in the CBRE Holding ClassA common stock fund, the participant may receive all or a portion of his or her balance in that fund either in shares or in cash.

97 Each employment agreement provides that the executive's employment by CB Richard Ellis Services may be terminated by either party at any time. If during the term of the agreement CB Richard Ellis Services terminates the executive's employment without cause or the executive terminates his employment for good reason, the executive is entitled to the following severance payments and benefits:  any earned or accrued but unpaid salary, bonus, business expenses and employee benefits;  continued payment of base salary and average annual bonus based on the previous two fiscal years for a period of two years following the termination of employment; and  continued coverage under CB Richard Ellis Services' medical plans on the same basis as its active executives until the earlier of the second anniversary of the termination of employment or the date the executive becomes eligible for comparable coverage under any future employer's medical plan.
If during the term of the agreement the executive's employment is terminated due to his death or disability, the executive is entitled to the following severance payments:  any earned or accrued but unpaid salary, bonus, business expenses and employee benefits; and  a pro rata portion of any annual bonus that the executive would have been entitled to receive in the year of termination, payable at the time the bonus would otherwise have been paid.
Each employment agreement also contains a customary provision regarding confidentiality, a non-solicitation provision applicable for a period of two years following the executive's termination of employment for any reason and a non-compete provision applicable for a period of two years following the executive's termination of employment with CB Richard Ellis Services without cause or by the executive for good reason.
Kenneth Kay.
On June13, 2002, Mr.Kay entered into a two-year employment agreement with CBRE Holding to serve as its Chief Financial Officer.
Pursuant to his employment agreement, he will receive an annual base salary of approximately $450,000, a sign-on bonus of $300,000 and will be eligible for an annual bonus of up to 66 2 / 3 % of his base salary based upon the achievement of performance goals established by CBRE Holding's Board of Directors.

If Mr.Kay voluntarily resigns from his employment within the first 24 months of employment, he will not be eligible to receive this severance payment. In the event that Mr.Kay's employment is terminated as a result of a change of control, he is eligible to receive 150% of one year's base salary as a severance payment in lieu of any other severance payment to which he would otherwise be entitled.
Mr.Kay's employment agreement also contains a customary provision regarding confidentiality following his termination of employment with CBRE Holding.
98 Limitation of Liability and Indemnification Each of CBRE Holding's and CB Richard Ellis Services' respective restated certificate of incorporation include provisions that eliminate the personal liability of their directors for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such limitation is not permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
CBRE Holding's and CB Richard Ellis Services' respective restated certificates of incorporation and bylaws further provide for the indemnification of their directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Section145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, including circumstances in which indemnification is otherwise discretionary. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to their directors, officers and controlling persons under the foregoing provisions or otherwise, they have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC this indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In addition, CB Richard Ellis Services maintains and CBRE Holding may in the future obtain directors' and officers' liability insurance.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The members of the compensation committee are Claus Moller, Frederic Malek and Bradford Freeman. None of the executive officers of CBRE Holding serves as a member of the Board of Directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on CBRE Holding's Board of Directors or compensation committee.

101 The following table sets forth information as of December31, 2002 with respect to compensation plans under which equity securities of the Company are authorized for issuance: (I) (II) (III) Plan Category Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants Weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options and warrants Number of securities remaining available for future issuance under plans [excluding securities listed in column(I)] Equity compensation plans approved by shareholders 1,707,076 $ 18.10 5,048,401 Equity compensation plans not approved by shareholders    Total 1,707,076 $ 18.10 5,048,401 Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions Since January1, 2002, there has not been, nor is there currently proposed, any transaction or series of similar transactions to which CB Richard Ellis Services or CBRE Holding both prior to and as of the 2001 Merger was, or is, or will be a party in which the amount involved exceeds $60,000 and in which any director, executive officer or holder of more than 5% of common stock, or an immediate family member of any of the foregoing, had or will have a direct or indirect interest other than as described below as well as in the compensation arrangements described in Item 11.
Securityholders' Agreement In connection with the closing of the 2001 Merger, the members of the buying group, together with CalPERS, DLJ Investment Funding,Inc. and CSFB, entered into a securityholders' agreement. This agreement defines various rights of the parties to the agreement related to their ownership and governance of CBRE Holding, including voting of the shares of CBRE Holding common stock, a right of first offer for potential sales of some of their shares, co-sale and required sale rights applicable in connection with transactions involving CBRE Holding shares, and participation rights regarding future issuances of CBRE Holding's shares of common stock and registration rights.
Each of the members of the buying group agreed to vote all of the shares of CBRE Holding's ClassB common stock it or he beneficially owns to elect to CBRE Holding's board of directors, individuals designated by various members of the buying group. A majority of the directors of CBRE Holding generally may be designated by Blum Strategic Partners at any time. Pursuant to the securityholders' agreement, the board of directors of CB Richard Ellis Services will be comprised of the same members as CBRE Holding's board of directors. Accordingly, CBRE Holding's and CB Richard Ellis Services' board of directors generally is controlled by Blum Strategic Partners after the 2001 Merger. In addition, FS Equity Partners III,L.P. and FS Equity Partners InternationalL.P., together, generally may designate one of CBRE Holding's directors and Raymond Wirta and Brett White also are each designated as a director. The securityholders' agreement also provides that CBRE Holding is prohibited from taking certain actions without the consent of the director nominated by FS Equity Partners III,L.P. and FS Equity Partners International,L.P., including incurring certain indebtedness, consummating certain acquisitions or dispositions or issuing stock or options to its employees, subject to certain exceptions.
Subject to exceptions, each of the members of the buying group agreed to vote the shares of CBRE Holding common stock it or he beneficially owns on matters to be decided by CBRE Holding stockholders in the same manner as Blum Strategic Partners votes the shares of CBRE Holding ClassB 102 common stock that it beneficially owns. As a result, on most matters to be decided by CBRE Holding stockholders, Blum Strategic Partners is able to control the outcome.
Pursuant to the securityholders' agreement, FS Equity Partners III and FS Equity Partners International, together, are entitled to have two non-voting observers, DLJ Investment Funding is entitled to have one non-voting observer and CalPERS is entitled to have one non-voting observer at all meetings of CBRE Holding's board of directors as long as, respectively, Freeman Spogli owns at least 7.5% of CBRE Holding's outstanding common stock, DLJ Investment Funding and its affiliates own at least 1.0% of CBRE Holding's outstanding common stock and a majority of the 16% senior notes issued by CBRE Holding, and CalPERS owns any of CBRE Holding's outstanding common stock.
Also pursuant to the securityholders' agreement, CBRE Holding has agreed, at the request of Blum Strategic Partners and Blum Strategic Partners II, FS Equity Partners III and FS Equity Partners International or DLJ Investment Funding to initiate the registration under the Securities Act of shares held by the requesting party. In addition, CBRE Holding has also agreed that each member of the buying group, as well as DLJ Investment Funding, has limited "piggyback" registration rights on specified types of registration statements that CBRE Holding files. These piggyback registration rights generally will not apply until after CBRE Holding has completed, if ever, an underwritten initial public offering of shares of its common stock after which these shares are listed on a national securities exchange or on the Nasdaq National Market. Piggyback rights will not apply to an underwritten initial public offering unless registrable securities of Blum Strategic Partners and Blum Strategic Partners II are sold in that offering.
Participation in the Offerings of CBRE Holding ClassA Common Stock and Options to Acquire ClassA Common Stock Purchase of Stock and Grants of Stock Options.
In connection with the offering of shares for direct ownership, each designated manager was entitled to receive a grant of options to purchase shares of CBRE Holding ClassA common stock if he or she subscribed for at least the percentage of 625,000 shares allocated to the designated manager by CBRE Holding's board of directors. The number of shares that a designated manager was required to subscribe for in order to receive a grant of options was reduced by the number of deferred compensation plan stock fund units acquired by the designated manager at the closing of the employee offerings by the transfer of account balances then allocated to the deferred compensation plan insurance fund. The aggregate number of options available for grant to the designated managers equaled approximately 10% of the number of fully diluted shares of CBRE Holding ClassA common stock and ClassB common stock outstanding at the time of the 2001 Merger, including all shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants. The options issued to designated managers have an exercise price of $16.00 per share and have a term of 10years. Twenty percent of the options vest on each of the first five anniversaries of the 2001 Merger and all unvested options vest if there is a change in control of CBRE Holding. The number of shares that were purchased by each executive officer were as follows: Raymond Wirta 64,063 shares; and Brett White 26,563 shares.
As a result, each executive officer received the following grants of options: Raymond Wirta 176,153 stock options; and Brett White 141,782 stock options.
103 Full-Recourse Note.
In connection with the offering of shares of CBRE Holding common stock for direct ownership, under specified circumstances, each designated manager was allowed to deliver to CBRE Holding a full-recourse note as payment for a portion of the offering price for shares that he or she purchased. The maximum amount of the full-recourse note that could be delivered by a designated manager was to be reduced by the amount, if any, of the manager's deferred compensation plan account balance then allocated to the insurance fund that he or she transferred to stock fund units. Unless CBRE Holding's Board of Directors determined otherwise, each designated manager was able to use a full-recourse note if the designated manager subscribed for at least the percentage of the 625,000 shares that was allocated to the designated manager by CBRE Holding's Board of Directors.
Accordingly, based upon each of their participation in the employee offerings, the amount of the full-recourse notes that each of the executive officers delivered to CBRE Holding as payment for a portion of the shares he purchased in the offering of shares for direct ownership was the following: Raymond Wirta $512,504; and Brett White $209,734.
Each of these executive officers pledged as security for his full-recourse notea number of shares having an offering price equal to 200% of the amount of the note. These notes bear interest at 10% per year, payable quarterly. During 2002, Mr.Wirta paid down his loan amount by $40,004 (leaving an outstanding principal balance of approximately $472,500 as of December31, 2002) and Mr.White paid off his note in its entirety.
Other Related Party Loans.
Pursuant to the Company's 1996 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP), Mr.Wirta purchased 30,000shares of CBRE common stock in 2000 at a purchase price of $12.875 per share that was paid for by delivery of a full recourse promissory note bearing interest at 7.40%. As part of the 2001 Merger, the 30,000shares of CBRE common stock were exchanged for 30,000shares of ClassB common stock of the Company. These shares of ClassB common stock were substituted for the CBRE shares as security for the promissory note. All interest charged on the outstanding promissory note balance for any year is forgiven if Mr.Wirta's performance produces a high enough level of bonus (approximately $7,500 of interest is forgiven for each $10,000 of bonus). As a result of bonuses paid in 2001 and in 2002, all interest on Mr.Wirta's promissory note for 2000 and 2001 was forgiven. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, Mr.Wirta had an outstanding loan balance of $385,950.
Pursuant to the Company's 1996EIP, Mr.White purchased 25,000shares of CBRE common stock in 1998 at a purchase price of $38.50 per share and 20,000shares of CBRE common stock in 2000 at a purchase price of $12.875 per share. These purchases were paid for by delivery of full recourse promissory notes bearing interest at 7.40%. As part of the 2001Merger, Mr.White's shares of CBRE common stock were exchanged for a like amount of shares of ClassB common stock of the Company. These shares of ClassB common stock were substituted for the CBRE shares as security for the notes. A First Amendment to Mr.White's 1998 promissory note provided that the portion of the then outstanding principal in excess of the fair market value of the shares would be forgiven in the event that Mr.White was an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries on November16, 2002 and the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock was less than $38.50 on November16, 2002. Mr.White's 1998 promissory note was subsequently amended, terminating the First Amendment and adjusting the original 1998Stock Purchase Agreement by reducing the purchase price from $38.50 to $16.00. During 2002, the 25,000shares held as security for the Second Amended Promissory Note were tendered as full payment for the remaining balance of $400,000 on the 1998 promissory note. All interest charged on the outstanding promissory note balances for any year is forgiven if Mr.White's 104 performance produces a high enough level of bonus (approximately $7,500 of interest is forgiven for each $10,000 of bonus). As a result of bonuses paid in 2001 and in 2002, all interest on Mr.White's promissory notes for 2000 and 2001 was forgiven. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, Mr.White had outstanding loan balances of $257,300 and $657,300.
As of December31, 2002 and 2001, Mr.White had an outstanding loan of $164,832. This outstanding loan relates to the acquisition of 12,500shares of CBRE's common stock prior to the 2001Merger. Subsequent to the 2001Merger, these shares were converted into shares of the Company's common stock and the related loan amount was carried forward. This loan bears interest at 6.0% and is payable at the earlier of: (i)October14, 2003, (ii)the date of the sale of shares held by the Company pursuant to the related security agreement or (iii)the date of the termination of Mr.White's employment.
In connection with the 2001Merger and related transactions, CBRE Holding extended a loan of approximately $2.7million to the Koll Holding Company, which is controlled by Donald Koll, to replace its former margin loan with a third party that were secured by shares of CB Richard Ellis Services common stock. The new loan is full-recourse, accrues interest at LIBOR plus 1.4%, compounds annually, is payable quarterly, and has a stated maturity of five years. This new loan will be replaced by a margin loan from a third party when, if ever, CBRE Holding common stock becomes freely tradable on a national securities exchange or an over-the-counter market.
However, in the event that CBRE Holding common stock is not freely tradable as described above by June2004, CBRE Holding has agreed to loan Raymond Wirta up to $3.0million on a full-recourse basis to enable him to exercise an existing option to acquire shares held by The Koll Holding Company, if Mr.Wirta is employed by CBRE Holding at the time of exercise or was terminated without cause or resigned for good reason. This loan will become repayable upon the earliest to occur of: (1)90days following termination of his employment, other than by CBRE Holding without cause or by him for good reason, (2)seven months following the date CBRE Holding's common stock becomes freely tradable as described above or (3)the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the pledged shares as described below. This loan will bear interest at the prime rate in effect on the date of the loan, compounded annually, and will be repayable to the extent of any net proceeds received by Mr.Wirta upon the sale of any shares of CBRE Holding common stock. Mr.Wirta will pledge the shares received upon exercise of the option as security for the loan.
In connection with his obligation to purchase 5,000shares of CBRE Holding ClassB common stock for $16.00 per share pursuant to the contribution and voting agreement, Mr.Wirta delivered to CBRE Holding an $80,000 promissory note, which bore interest at 10% per year and was payable in June2004. Mr.Wirta repaid this promissory note in full in April of 2002.
On April1, 2002, the Company loaned $300,000 to Mr.Wirta and $200,000 to Mr.White. These non-interest bearing loans are due and payable on December31, 2003.
