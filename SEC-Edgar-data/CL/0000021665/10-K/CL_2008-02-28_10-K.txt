Colgate is a leader in many product categories of the Personal Care market. The Personal Care market includes shower gels, shampoos, conditioners, bar soaps, and deodorants and antiperspirants as well as liquid hand soaps in which Colgate is the market leader in the U.S. based on value share data provided by ACNielsen. Significant recent product launches include Palmolive Naturals Mint& Eucalyptus, Palmolive Pure Cashmere, Palmolive Thermal Spa Seabuckthorn, Protex Deo 12 and Protex Icy Cool bar soaps, Palmolive Thermal Spa Seabuckthorn shower gel, Palmolive BodYogurt body wash, Palmolive Pure Cashmere shower cream, Softsoap brand Nutra-Oil moisturizing body wash, Palmolive Caprice shampoo and Lady Speed Stick for Teens multi-form deodorant.
Colgate manufactures and markets a wide array of products for Home Care, including Palmolive and Ajax dishwashing liquids, Fabuloso and Ajax household cleaners and Murphys Oil Soap. Colgate is a market leader in fabric conditioners with leading brands including Suavitel in Latin America and Soupline in Europe. Significant recent product launches in Home Care include Palmolive Scrub Buster with Micro Beads dish liquid, Soupline Aromatherapy and Suavitel fabric conditioners, Fabuloso liquid cleaner, Ajax Professional bucket dilutable cleaner and Ajax Professional glass cleaner.
Sales of Oral, Personal and Home Care products accounted for 40%, 23% and 24%, respectively, of total worldwide sales in 2007. Geographically, Oral Care is a significant part of the Companys business in Greater Asia/Africa , comprising approximately 64% of sales in that region for 2007.
Colgate, through its Hills Pet Nutrition segment (Hills), is a world leader in specialty pet nutrition products for dogs and cats with products marketed in over 90 countries around the world. Hills markets pet foods 1 Table of Contents primarily under two trademarks: Science Diet, which is sold by authorized pet supply retailers, breeders and veterinarians for everyday nutritional needs; and Prescription Diet, a range of therapeutic products sold by veterinarians to help nutritionally manage disease conditions in dogs and cats. Significant recent Science Diet product launches include Science Plan Chunks in Gravy Feline pouches as well as the relaunch of Science Diet Natures Best Canine. Significant recent Prescription Diet product launches include Prescription Diet c/d Multicare Feline, Prescription Diet j/d Light Canine and Prescription Diet Hypo-Allergenic Treats for dogs and cats. Sales of Pet Nutrition products accounted for 13% of the Companys total worldwide sales in 2007. For more information regarding the Companys worldwide sales by product categories, refer to Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Research and Development Strong research and development capabilities and alliances enable Colgate to support its many brands with technologically sophisticated products to meet consumers oral, personal and home care and pet nutrition needs. Company spending related to research and development activities was $247.0 million, $241.5 million and $238.5 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Distribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents The Companys products are generally marketed by a direct sales force at each individual operating subsidiary or business unit. In some instances, distributors or brokers are used. No single customer accounts for 10% or more of the Companys sales.
Most raw and packaging materials are purchased from other companies and are available from several sources. For certain materials, however, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards, which can require additional investment and take some period of time. Raw and packaging material commodities such as resins, tallow, corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations. No single raw or packaging material represents a significant portion of the Companys total material requirements.
The Companys products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which is experiencing increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. Products similar to those produced and sold by the Company are available from competitors in the U.S. and overseas. Certain of the Companys competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains are a source of competition for certain product lines of the Company. Product quality and innovation, brand recognition, marketing capability and acceptance of new products largely determine success in the Companys business segments.
Trademarks are considered to be of material importance to the Companys business. The Company follows a practice of seeking trademark protection by all appropriate means in the U.S. and throughout the world where the Companys products are sold. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, Mennen, Softsoap, Irish Spring, Protex, Sorriso, Kolynos, Elmex, Toms of Maine, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Soupline, Suavitel, Hills Science Diet and Hills Prescription Diet. The Companys rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and registered. Although the Company actively develops and maintains a portfolio of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole.
Employees As of December31, 2007, the Company employed approximately 36,000 employees.
Environmental Matters The Company has programs that are designed to ensure that its operations and facilities meet or exceed standards established by applicable environmental rules and regulations. Capital expenditures for environmental 2 Table of Contents control facilities totaled $15.6 million for 2007. For future years, expenditures are expected to be in the same range. For additional information regarding environmental matters refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(d) Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales For financial data by geographic region, refer to the information set forth under the caption Results of Operations in Part II, Item7, of this report and in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Effective January1, 2006, the Company modified the geographic reporting structure of its Oral, Personal and Home Care segment in order to address evolving markets and more closely align countries with similar consumer needs and retail trade structures. Management responsibility for Eastern European operations, including Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and Belarus, was transferred to Greater Asia management, and responsibility for operations in the South Pacific, including Australia, was transferred to European management. The financial information for 2005 has been reclassified to conform to the new reporting structure.
(e) Available Information The Companys website address is www.colgate.com . The information contained on the Companys website is not included as a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company makes available, free of charge on its Internet website, its annual reports on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, its current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company has electronically filed such material with, or furnished it to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).

ITEM1A.
RISK FACTORS Set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities.
We face risks associated with significant international operations.
We operate on a global basis with approximately 75% of our net sales coming from operations outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce the Companys exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:  changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive from non-U.S. markets or increase our labor or supply costs in those markets,  political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets,  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and  changes in foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other government controls and the ability to repatriate earnings from overseas.
These risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. We monitor our foreign currency exposure to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements 3 Table of Contents through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs. We cannot provide assurances, however, that these measures will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operation.
Significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.
We face vigorous competition around the world, including from other large, multinational consumer product companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. We face this competition in several aspects of our business, including, but not limited to:  the pricing of products,  promotional activities,  advertising, and  new product introductions.
We may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such activities or initiatives by competitors or to successfully counteract them, which could harm our business. In addition, the cost of responding to such activities and initiatives may affect our financial performance in the relevant period. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands, on whether we can attract and retain key talent, and on our ability to protect our patent, trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors. A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability.
Changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business.
Our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which is experiencing an increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. With the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining strength than we do. They may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances or slotting fees, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. We may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and other conditions. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains, which are typically sold at lower prices, are a source of competition for certain of our product lines.
The growth of our business depends on the successful development and introduction of new products.
Our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions, which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors. In addition, our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can:  develop and fund technological innovations,  receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection,  obtain governmental approvals and registrations of regulated products,  comply with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other governmental regulations, and  anticipate consumer needs and preferences successfully.
The failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our Company not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position.
4 Table of Contents Rising material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability.
Raw and packaging material commodities such as resins, tallow, corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations. Increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy, transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, our move to global suppliers, for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business, has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers. For certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards, which can require additional investment and take some period of time. While we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate, global economic conditions, supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of, or prices for, those raw materials.
Our results could suffer if we do not implement our 2004 Restructuring Program according to our expectations.
In December 2004, we commenced the 2004 Restructuring Program, a four-year restructuring and business-building program to enhance our global leadership position in our core businesses. While the Company is three years into the implementation of this program and many of the projects under the program have successfully been implemented or are nearing completion, its on-going implementation will continue to present significant organizational challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties, including labor organizations and business partners who may provide us manufacturing or administrative services. We cannot provide assurances that:  the 2004 Restructuring Program will continue to be implemented successfully and in accordance with the planned timetable,  the actual charges incurred will not exceed the estimated charges, or  the full extent of the expected savings will be realized.
A failure to implement the remaining elements of the 2004 Restructuring Program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our profitability.
Our business is subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad.
The manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, advertising and sale of consumer products are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and abroad. This regulation includes, but is not limited to, the following:  in the U.S., our products and the manufacture of our products are subject to regulation and review by the FDA as well as by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency;  also in the U.S., claims and advertising with respect to our products are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission;  we are also subject to regulation in the foreign countries in which we manufacture and sell our products and by state and local agencies in the U.S. that regulate in parallel to the above agencies; and  our selling practices are regulated by competition authorities in the U.S. and abroad.
A finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is not merited or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation and brand image.
5 Table of Contents We have obtained all required regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell our products. New or more restrictive regulations or more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations, however, could have an adverse impact on our business. For example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in Europe, the U.S. and other countries conduct reviews of the use of triclosan in certain consumer products. In 2005, the FDA established an advisory panel to examine the use of certain anti-microbials, including triclosan, in anti-microbial hand soaps, wipes and hand sanitizers. A finding by the FDA or an overseas regulatory authority that triclosan should not be used in certain consumer products could have an adverse impact on our business, as could negative reactions to triclosan from consumers, our trade customers or non-governmental organizations. Currently, Colgate uses triclosan in certain of its oral, personal and home care products, including Colgate Total toothpaste, Softsoap brand liquid hand soap and Protex bar soap.
Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities.
As a company engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to:  availability of key raw materials,  industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues,  environmental events,  strikes and other labor disputes,  disruptions in logistics,  loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites,  raw material and product quality or safety issues,  counterfeit products,  licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, and  natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control.
While we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and supply of raw materials, significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, if our products, or raw materials contained in our products, are found or perceived to be defective or unsafe, we may need to recall some of our products; our reputation and brand image could be diminished; and we could lose market share or become subject to liability claims, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
The risks described above are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of the above risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.

ITEM3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In 1995, the Company acquired the Kolynos oral care business from Wyeth (formerly American Home Products) (the Seller), as described in the Companys Form 8-K dated January10, 1995. On September8, 1998, the Companys Brazilian subsidiary received notice of an administrative proceeding from the Central Bank of Brazil primarily taking issue with certain foreign exchange filings made with the Central Bank in connection with the financing of this strategic transaction, but in no way challenging or seeking to unwind the acquisition. The Central Bank of Brazil in January 2001 notified the Company of its decision in this administrative proceeding to impose a fine which, at the current exchange rate, approximates $147 million. The Company appealed the imposition of the fine to the Brazilian Monetary System Appeals Council (the Council), and on January30, 2007, the Council decided the appeal in the Companys favor, dismissing the fine entirely.
In addition, the Brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the Companys Brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the Kolynos acquisition. The tax assessments with interest, at the current exchange rate, approximate $123 million. The Company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments within the internal revenue authoritys appellate process, with the following results to date:  In June 2005, the First Board of Taxpayers ruled in the Companys favor and allowed all of the previously claimed deductions for 1996 through 1998, which represent more than half of the total exposure. The tax authorities have appealed this decision to the next administrative level.
In March 2007, the First Board of Taxpayers ruled in the Companys favor and allowed all of the previously claimed deductions for 1999 through 2001, which represent the remaining exposure. The tax authorities could appeal this decision to the next administrative level.
In the event of an adverse decision within the internal revenue authoritys appellate process, further appeals are available within the Brazilian federal courts. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel and other experts, that the disallowances are without merit and that the Company should prevail on appeal either at the administrative level or, if necessary, in the Brazilian federal courts. The Company intends to challenge these assessments vigorously.
In addition, Brazilian prosecutors reviewed the foregoing transactions as part of an overall examination of all international transfers of Reais through non-resident current accounts during the 1992 to 1998 time frame, a 7 Table of Contents review that the Company understands involved hundreds and possibly thousands of other individuals and companies unrelated to the Company. At the request of these prosecutors, in February 2004, a federal judge agreed to authorize criminal charges against certain current and former officers of the Companys Brazilian subsidiary based on the same allegations made in the Central Bank and tax proceedings discussed above. Management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that these officers behaved in all respects properly and in accordance with the law in connection with the financing of the Kolynos acquisition. Management intends to support and defend these officers vigorously.
In 2002, the Brazilian Federal Public Attorney filed a civil action against the federal government of Brazil, Laboratorios Wyeth-Whitehall Ltda., the Brazilian subsidiary of the Seller, and the Company, as represented by its Brazilian subsidiary, seeking to annul an April 2000 decision by the Brazilian Board of Tax Appeals that found in favor of the Sellers subsidiary on the issue of whether it had incurred taxable capital gains as a result of the divestiture of Kolynos. The action seeks to make the Companys Brazilian subsidiary jointly and severally liable for any tax due from the Sellers subsidiary. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that the Company should ultimately prevail in this action. The Company intends to challenge this action vigorously.
In December 2005, the Brazilian internal revenue authority issued to the Companys Brazilian subsidiary a tax assessment with interest and penalties of approximately $64 million at the current exchange rate, based on a claim that certain purchases of U.S. Treasury bills by the subsidiary and their subsequent disposition during the period of 2000 to 2001 were subject to a tax on foreign exchange transactions. The Company is disputing the assessment within the internal revenue authoritys administrative appeals process. In October 2007, the Second Board of Taxpayers ruled in favor of the internal revenue authority. The Company intends to appeal this decision to the next administrative level. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that the tax assessment is without merit and that the Company should prevail either through administrative appeal or if necessary through further appeal in the Brazilian federal courts. The Company intends to challenge this assessment vigorously.
In February 2006, the Company learned that French competition authorities initiated an inquiry into potential competition law violations in France involving exchanges of competitive information and agreements on selling terms and conditions among a number of consumer goods companies in France, including the Companys French subsidiary. In February 2007, the Company learned that the Swiss competition authorities opened an investigation against the Companys GABA Holding AG (GABA) subsidiary regarding distribution policies, retail pricing and parallel trade. Governmental investigations or proceedings relating to competition law involving the Company have also been commenced in Romania and Germany. At this time, no formal claim for a fine or penalty has been made against the Company in any of the above matters. In February 2008, the federal competition authority in Germany imposed fines on four of the Companys competitors, but the Company was not fined due to its cooperation with the German authorities, consistent with the policy described below. The Companys policy is to comply with antitrust and competition laws and, if a violation of any such laws is found, to take appropriate remedial action and to cooperate fully with any related governmental inquiry. The Company has undertaken a comprehensive review of its selling practices and related competition law compliance in Europe and elsewhere and, where the Company has identified a lack of compliance, it is undertaking remedial action. While the Company cannot predict the final financial impact of these competition law issues as these matters may change, the Company has taken and will, if necessary, take additional reserves as appropriate.
In October 2007, a putative class action claiming that certain aspects of the cash balance portion of the Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees Retirement Income Plan (the Plan) do not comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act was filed against the Plan and the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Specifically, Proesel, et al. v. Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees Retirement Income Plan, et al.
, alleges improper calculation of lump sum distributions, age discrimination and failure to satisfy minimum accrual requirements, thereby resulting in the underpayment of benefits to Plan participants. The Company is seeking to consolidate this case with two other putative class actions filed earlier in 8 Table of Contents 2007 ( Abelman, et al. v. Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees Retirement Income Plan, et al.
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio and Caulfield v. Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees Retirement Income Plan in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana) alleging improper calculation of lump sum distributions and, in the case of Abelman , claims for failure to satisfy minimum accrual requirements. The relief sought in the three actions includes recalculation of benefits in unspecified amounts, pre- and post-judgment interest, injunctive relief and attorneys fees. None of the actions has been certified as a class action as yet. The Company intends to contest these actions vigorously.
For additional discussion of the Companys legal proceedings refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers on a global basis with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.
To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organizations core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.
Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Companys sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Companys exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.
The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments: NorthAmerica, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. In the Pet Nutrition segment, Hills also competes on a worldwide basis, selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers.
On an on-going basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators, as well as the Companys corporate governance practices (including the Companys Code of Conduct), are used to ensure that business health and strong internal controls are maintained.
To achieve its financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive growth and to fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, in particular by deploying valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. Growth opportunities are enhanced in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Companys products.
The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition.
Consistent with the Companys strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, in the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company announced its agreement to sell its household bleach businesses in Latin America and Canada. The transaction closed in Canada during the fourth quarter of 2006. In the Latin American countries, the transaction closed during the first quarter of 2007 with the exception of Colombia, where the transaction did not receive regulatory approval and the parties have agreed not to proceed with the sale. Also consistent with this strategy the Company divested its North American and Southeast Asian heavy-duty laundry detergent brands during 2005.
13 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company purchased 84% of the outstanding shares of Toms of Maine, Inc. in 2006. This acquisition allowed the Company to enter the fast-growing health and specialty trade channel in the U.S. where Toms of Maine toothpaste and deodorants are market leaders.
The Companys previously announced four-year restructuring and business-building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses is progressing on schedule. On April24, 2007, the Company expanded the 2004 Restructuring Program to encompass additional savings projects identified by the Company during the course of implementing the program. These additional projects will not extend the length of the program beyond the anticipated completion date of December31, 2008. Including the expansion, the cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all the projects are approved and implemented, totaling between $1,000 and $1,075 ($725 and $775 aftertax). Once all projects are implemented, savings are projected to be in the range of $425 and $475 ($325 and $350 aftertax) annually, substantially all of which is expected to increase future cash flows.
Looking forward into 2008, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, the Company believes it is well positioned for continued growth. As further explained in the Outlook section of Part II, Item7, of this report, over the long-term, the Companys continued focus on its consumer products business, the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets and its strong capital base all position it to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value.
Results of Operations Net Sales Worldwide Net sales were $13,789.7 in 2007, up 12.5% from 2006 driven by volume growth of 6.5%, net selling price increases of 1.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 5.0%. The divestments of the Latin American and Canadian household bleach businesses in 2007 and 2006, respectively, reduced sales growth for the year ended December31, 2007, by 0.5% versus the comparable period of 2006. Excluding the impact of these divestments, sales increased 13.0% in 2007 on volume growth of 7.0%.
Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $11,930.6 in 2007, up 13.0% from 2006 driven by volume growth of 7.0%, net selling price increases of 0.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 5.5%. The divestments of the Latin American and Canadian household bleach businesses reduced sales growth for the year ended December31, 2007, by 0.5% versus the comparable period of 2006. Excluding the impact of these divestments, sales increased 13.5% in 2007 on volume growth of 7.5%.
Net sales in Hills Pet Nutrition were $1,859.1 in 2007, up 11.5% from 2006 driven by volume growth of 3.5%, net selling price increases of 5.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.5%.
In 2006, worldwide Net sales were $12,237.7, up 7.5% from 2005 driven by volume growth of 5.5%, an increase in net selling prices of 1.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 0.5%. The 2005 divestment of the Companys heavy-duty laundry detergent business in North America and Southeast Asia reduced sales growth for the year ended December31, 2006, by 1.5% versus the comparable period of 2005. Excluding the impact of the 2005 divestments, sales increased 9.0% in 2006 on volume growth of 7.0%.
Gross Profit Worldwide gross profit margin was 56.2% in 2007, 54.8% in 2006 and 54.4% in 2005. In 2007, Gross profit benefited from a continued focus on cost-savings programs, lower charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program and the shift toward higher margin products, which more than offset the impact of higher raw and 14 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) packaging material costs. The increase in gross profit margin in 2006 from 2005 was driven by the benefits from higher pricing, a continued focus on cost-savings programs and a shift towards higher margin products, which more than offset the impact of higher raw and packaging material costs and increased charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program.
Restructuring and related implementation charges incurred under the 2004 Restructuring Program included in Cost of sales for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $153.8, $196.2 and $100.2, respectively. These charges included ramp-down costs related to the closure of existing manufacturing facilities, start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities, accelerated depreciation and certain employee termination benefits. The 2004 Restructuring Program lowered the reported gross profit margin by 110 basis points (bps), 160 bps and 90 bps in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excluding the impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program, gross profit margin increased to 57.3% in 2007 as compared to 56.4% in 2006 and 55.3% in 2005.
For additional information regarding the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales were 36.1% in 2007, 35.6% in 2006 and 34.4% in 2005. The 50 bps increase in 2007 was driven primarily by increased advertising (40 bps) and an increase in shipping and handling costs. Advertising increased 17% to $1,545.7 as compared to 2006, on top of an 11% increase in the year-ago period. During 2007, the increase in gross profit margin and other savings programs funded an increase in advertising, supporting new product launches and helping increase market shares throughout the world. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2006 increased by a net 120 bps as compared to 2005, primarily due to increased advertising (30 bps), charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program (40 bps) and incremental stock-based compensation expense recognized as a result of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R) (60 bps). Selling, general and administrative expenses include charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $49.1 in 2007, $46.1 in 2006 and $1.8 in 2005.
Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $121.3, $185.9 and $69.2 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below: 2007 2006 2005 Minority interest $ 67.1 $ 57.5 $ 55.3 Amortization of intangible assets 18.2 16.3 15.6 Equity (income) (3.7 ) (3.4 ) (2.0 ) Gains on sales of non-core product lines, net (48.6 ) (46.5 ) (147.9 ) 2004 Restructuring Program 55.6 153.1 80.8 Hills limited voluntary recall 12.6   Pension and other retiree benefits SFAS 88 charges 15.4  34.0 Investment losses (income) (1.5 ) (5.7 ) 19.7 Other, net 6.2 14.6 13.7 Total Other (income) expense, net $ 121.3 $ 185.9 $ 69.2 As noted in the preceding table, Other (income) expense, net in 2007 included a gain on the sale of the Companys household bleach business in Latin America, which was offset by charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, the limited voluntary recall of certain Hills Pet Nutrition feline products (see the 15 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Segment Results section, below, for further information regarding the voluntary recall) and pension and other retiree benefits. The charges associated with pension and other retiree benefits were primarily a result of lump sum payments of normal retirement benefits associated with a nonqualified retirement plan in the U.S. as required by SFAS No.88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Termination Benefits (SFAS 88 charges).
Other (income) expense, net in 2006 included a gain on the sale of the Companys household bleach business in Canada, which was more than offset by charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program.
Other (income) expense, net in 2005 included a gain on the sale of heavy-duty laundry detergent businesses in North America and Southeast Asia, which was partially offset by charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and pension and other retiree benefits. The charges associated with pension and other retiree benefits were primarily a result of the conversion of one of the Companys international pension plans to a defined contribution plan for all eligible participants and a lump sum payment of normal retirement benefits associated with a retirement plan in the U.S. as required by SFAS 88.
Investment losses (income) consisted of gains and losses on foreign currency contracts, principally due to declines and increases in the fair value of foreign-denominated deposits, which are economic hedges of certain foreign currency debt but do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Operating Profit In 2007, Operating profit increased 23% to $2,653.1 as compared to $2,160.5 in 2006 and decreased 2% in 2006 as compared to $2,215.0 in 2005. All years presented benefited from sales growth and cost-saving initiatives. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to a higher gross profit margin and a decrease in charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $136.9. These items were partially offset by higher advertising, the negative impact of SFAS 88 charges and the limited voluntary recall of certain Hills Pet Nutrition feline products.
In 2006, Operating profit decreased 2% to $2,160.5 as compared to $2,215.0 in 2005, primarily due to an increase in charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $212.6, lower gains on sale of non-core product lines of $101.4 and incremental stock-based compensation expense of $69.8 recognized as a result of adopting SFAS 123R, partially offset by a higher gross profit margin. Operating profit in 2005 included $34.0 of charges related to the re-measurement of certain pension obligations; there was no comparable amount in 2006.
Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $156.6 in 2007 compared with $158.7 in 2006 and $136.0 in 2005. The increase in Interest expense, net from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher average interest rates in 2006.
Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 30.4% in 2007, 32.4% in 2006 and 35.0% in 2005. The tax rate in all years was impacted by the benefits of global tax planning strategies, the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, gains on asset sales and other one-time items. The 2007 effective tax rate of 30.4% reflects a 300 bps reduction from the recognition of $73.9 of tax benefits as a result of the reduction of a tax loss carryforward valuation allowance in Brazil of $94.6 that was partially offset by tax provisions for the recapitalization of certain overseas subsidiaries and an increase of 40 bps from the impact of the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and 10 bps from the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America. The 2006 effective income tax rate of 32.4% reflects an 80 bps increase from the impact of the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and a decrease of 30 bps from the sale of the household bleach business in Canada. Also increasing the 2007 effective rate is the cost associated with higher remittances from overseas subsidiaries and the one-time impact of statutory tax rate changes in certain overseas subsidiaries.
16 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program on the effective income tax rate for an individual period will depend upon the projects and the related tax jurisdictions involved. The tax benefit derived from the charges incurred in 2007, 2006 and 2005 for the 2004 Restructuring Program was at a rate of 28.9%, 27.6% and 20.6%, respectively. Over its duration, charges associated with the 2004 Restructuring Program are projected to generate tax benefits at a rate between 25% and 30%.
For additional information regarding the Companys income taxes, refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net Income Net income was $1,737.4 in 2007 or $3.20 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,353.4 in 2006 or $2.46 per share and $1,351.4 in 2005 or $2.43 per share. Net income in 2007 included a $29.7 ($0.05 per share) gain on the sale of the household bleach business in Latin America and an income tax benefit of $73.9 ($0.14 per share) related to the tax items noted above. Such benefits were more than offset by $183.7 ($0.34 per share) of charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, $10.0 ($0.02 per share) of SFAS 88 charges and $8.2 ($0.01 per share) of charges related to the limited voluntary recall of certain Hills Pet Nutrition feline products. Net income in 2006 included a $38.2 ($0.07 per share) gain on the sale of the household bleach business in Canada, which was more than offset by $286.3 ($0.52 per share) of charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and $48.1 ($0.09 per share) of incremental stock-based compensation charges due to the adoption of SFAS 123R as compared to 2005. In 2005, Net income was impacted by a net aftertax charge of $115.2 ($0.21 per share) related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, gains on sales of certain non-core product lines, income tax expense for the incremental repatriation of foreign earnings related to The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) and certain pension charges.
Segment Results The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.

Science Diet Indoor Cat and Science Diet Light contributed to growth in feline products. Prescription Diet c/d Multicare Feline, Prescription Diet j/d Canine and new Prescription Diet Hypoallergenic Treats for dogs and cats contributed to growth in the U.S. veterinary channel. Internationally, growth was led by South Africa, the Nordic region, Australia, Spain and Russia. New pet food products contributing to the international growth include Prescription Diet j/d Light Canine, Science Plan Chunks in Gravy Feline pouches and Prescription Diet c/d Multicare Feline. In 2006, Net sales for Hills Pet Nutrition increased 10.0% to $1,669.1 on volume gains of 6.0% and an increase in net selling prices of 4.5%, offset by a 0.5% negative impact of foreign exchange.
Like most major North American pet food producers, Hills Pet Nutrition was affected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations pet food recall in March 2007. Hills took the precaution of conducting a voluntary recall of a small number of its products that may have been affected. These products accounted for less than 0.5% of Hills Pet Nutritions annual Net sales. The related sales loss did not have a significant impact on the Companys 2007 annual Net sales or Operating profit. Hills Pet Nutritions Operating profit for 2007 does not reflect the impact of the recall as these costs have been included in the Corporate segment.
Operating profit increased 9% to $487.8 in 2007 due to increased sales offset by higher agricultural commodities costs. In 2006, Operating profit grew 9% to $447.9 due to increased sales, partially offset by higher advertising.
Corporate Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment was ($634.1), ($670.3) and ($306.8) for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Corporate operations include research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, stock-based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock awards, restructuring and related implementation costs, gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets and certain SFAS 88 charges. The components of Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment are presented below: 2007 2006 2005 Gains on sales of non-core product lines, net $ 48.6 $ 46.5 $ 147.9 2004 Restructuring Program (258.5 ) (395.4 ) (182.8 ) Pension and other retiree benefits SFAS 88 charges (15.4 )  (24.8 ) Hills limited voluntary recall (13.6 )   Corporate overhead cost and other, net (395.2 ) (321.4 ) (247.1 ) Total Corporate Operating profit (loss) $ (634.1 ) $ (670.3 ) $ (306.8 ) Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2007 decreased as compared to 2006, primarily due to lower charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program, offset by higher costs resulting from supply chain globalization initiatives implemented under the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and increases in research and development costs and other new product initiatives. In addition, 2007 includes the negative impact of SFAS 88 charges and the negative impact of the limited voluntary recall of certain Hills Pet Nutrition feline products.
The increase in Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily driven by higher restructuring charges and incremental stock-based compensation of $69.8 recognized as a result of adopting SFAS 123R and lower gains on the sale of certain non-core product lines. In 2005, Corporate Operating profit (loss) included the remeasurement of certain pension obligations as required by SFAS 88.
20 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Corporate Operating profit (loss) includes charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program of $258.5 in 2007, $395.4 in 2006 and $182.8 in 2005. Charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program were higher in 2006 as a result of the charges related to the voluntary early retirement program applicable to certain U.S. employees, which was implemented in 2006.
For additional information regarding the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges, below, and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net sales and volume growth both worldwide and in relevant geographic divisions are discussed in this Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding divestments (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors as they allow comparisons of Net sales and volume growth from on-going operations. Worldwide Gross profit margin is discussed in this Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impact of restructuring charges (non-GAAP). Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the Companys on-going operations and is useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. While the Company believes that this financial measure is useful in evaluating the Companys business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges 2004 Restructuring Program The Companys previously announced four-year restructuring and business-building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses is progressing on schedule. As part of this program, the Company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain through the rationalization of approximately one-third of its manufacturing facilities and the closure of certain warehousing facilities and plans to centralize its purchasing and other business support functions. Business-building initiatives include enhancing and reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets.
On April24, 2007, the Company expanded the 2004 Restructuring Program to encompass additional savings projects identified by the Company during the course of implementing the program. These additional projects will not extend the length of the program beyond the anticipated completion date of December31, 2008. Including the expansion, the cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all the projects are approved and implemented, totaling between $1,000 and $1,075 ($725 and $775 aftertax). It is estimated that the total cumulative pretax charges of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program, once completed, will be comprised of the following: termination benefits (40%), incremental depreciation (20%), asset impairments (5%)and other charges consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%)and the implementation of new strategies (15%). Over the course of the four-year 2004 Restructuring Program, it is estimated that approximately 50%-60% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. The estimated cost in 2008 is between $95 and $170 ($70 and $125 aftertax). Once all projects are implemented, savings are projected to be in the range of $425 and $475 ($325 and $350 aftertax) annually, substantially all of which is expected to increase future cash flows.
During 2004, in connection with the initial phase of the program, the Company announced the closing or reconfiguration of eight manufacturing facilities in North America, Greater Asia/Africa, Europe and Latin America and the realignment of marketing and sales organizations in Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/ 21 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Africa. During 2005, the Company commenced additional projects, the more significant of which related to changes being implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks. These changes will allow the Company to manufacture toothpaste more cost effectively, by taking advantage of state-of-the-art technologies.
The Company is in the process of consolidating toothpaste production in Europe, which is currently located at five company sites, into a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Poland. Upon completion of the consolidation project within 2008, toothpaste manufacturing is expected to cease at the Companys facilities in Salford, United Kingdom; Brasov, Romania and Gebze, Turkey. Toothpaste manufacturing has already ceased at Anzio, Italy. Other manufacturing activities will continue at these sites, except the Salford facility, which is expected to be closed. In North America, the Company ceased production at its Jeffersonville, Indiana, plant in December 2007 and transferred production of the Companys market-leading Colgate Total toothpaste to a new state-of-the-art facility in Morristown, Tennessee, and relocated other production and administrative services performed at Jeffersonville to other facilities. The Companys Kansas City, Kansas facility, formerly the site of U.S. bar soap production, was closed in late 2006 and all production was transitioned to a U.S. third-party manufacturer.
In 2006, the Company continued with the implementation of previously announced projects, most notably the changes being implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks. In addition, the Company implemented several other projects, including a voluntary early retirement program in the United States, enabling the Company to continue to re-align organizational resources consistent with its business-building goals. Also consistent with its global manufacturing strategy, the Company initiated the closure of its toothbrush facility in Puerto Rico. During 2007, the Company continued to exit certain manufacturing activities and to re-align organizational resources in various locations throughout the world consistent with its business-building goals.
For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 restructuring and implementation-related charges are reflected in the income statement as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Cost of sales $ 153.8 $ 196.2 $ 100.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 49.1 46.1 1.8 Other (income) expense, net 55.6 153.1 80.8 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges, pretax $ 258.5 $ 395.4 $ 182.8 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges, aftertax $ 183.7 $ 286.3 $ 145.1 Restructuring charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these decisions are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.
22 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Total 2007 charges relate to the 2004 Restructuring Program in North America (36%), Europe/South Pacific (22%), Latin America (3%), Greater Asia/Africa (14%)and Corporate (25%). Total program-to-date accumulated charges relate to the 2004 Restructuring Program in North America (38%), Europe/South Pacific (29%), Latin America (4%), Greater Asia/Africa (9%)and Corporate (20%). Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred total pretax cumulative charges of $905.4 ($663.1 aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects as follows: CumulativeCharges asofDecember31,2007 Termination Benefits $ 393.8 Incremental Depreciation 201.5 Asset Impairments 59.1 Other 251.0 Total cumulative 2004 Restructuring Program charges, pretax $ 905.4 The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following significant projects: the voluntary early retirement program in the U.S.; the closing of the Jeffersonville, Indiana, oral care facility; the consolidation of toothpaste production in Europe; exiting certain manufacturing activities in other categories in Portugal, Denmark, Puerto Rico, Senegal and Kansas City, Kansas; and the realignment of sales, administrative and research and development functions in various locations around the world.
The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring charges discussed above and related accrual: Termination Benefits Incremental Depreciation Asset Impairments Other Total Balance at December31, 2004 $ 41.7 $  $  $ 0.4 $ 42.1 Charges 58.6 65.3 30.2 28.7 182.8 Cash payments (47.8 )   (23.4 ) (71.2 ) Charges against assets (11.4 ) (65.3 ) (30.2 ) (6.4 ) (113.3 ) Other (1.4 )   4.2 2.8 Foreign exchange (4.4 )   (0.1 ) (4.5 ) Balance at December31, 2005 $ 35.3 $  $  $ 3.4 $ 38.7 Charges 212.7 91.5 6.6 84.6 395.4 Cash payments (89.7 )   (75.3 ) (165.0 ) Charges against assets (98.4 ) (91.5 ) (6.6 ) (6.7 ) (203.2 ) Other (10.0 )   5.2 (4.8 ) Foreign exchange 3.5   0.1 3.6 Balance at December31, 2006 $ 53.4 $  $  $ 11.3 $ 64.7 Charges 80.9 41.4 0.3 135.9 258.5 Cash payments (65.3 )   (137.4 ) (202.7 ) Charges against assets (14.1 ) (41.4 ) (0.3 ) (4.6 ) (60.4 ) Other (2.2 )   3.6 1.4 Foreign exchange 1.9   0.2 2.1 Balance at December31, 2007 $ 54.6 $  $  $ 9.0 $ 63.6 23 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Termination benefits incurred pursuant to the 2004 Restructuring Program are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Termination benefits also include pension enhancements of $14.1 and $98.4 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Termination benefits in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets. In 2007 and 2006, Termination benefits also include $2.2 and $10.0, respectively, of charges related to other retiree benefit enhancements and are reflected in Other charges as an increase to other retiree benefit liabilities. In 2007 and 2006, the Company made voluntary contributions of $34.5 and $85.0, respectively, to partially fund this obligation. The Company anticipates that it will continue to make incremental cash contributions to its plans in order to fund its restructuring-related pension obligations over the duration of the 2004 Restructuring Program.
Incremental depreciation was recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset impairments have been recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.
Other charges primarily consist of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2004 Restructuring Program. These charges include ramp-down costs related to the closure of existing facilities, start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. For the year ended December31, 2007 charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities were $33.2, and costs incurred for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives were $37.9. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred $40.7 of charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities and $70.3 of costs for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. All costs relating to start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives are expensed as incurred.
Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company expects cash flow from operations and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including dividends, capital expenditures, planned stock repurchases and restructuring payments). The Companys strong cash-generating capability and financial condition also allow it broad access to financial markets worldwide.
Cash Flow Net cash provided by operations in 2007 was $2,203.7 as compared with $1,821.5 in 2006 and $1,784.4 in 2005. The increase in 2007 reflects the Companys improved profitability, decreased spending related to the 2004 Restructuring Program and changes in working capital, offset by a decrease in net deferred income tax liabilities.
The Companys working capital as a percentage of Net sales improved to 2.2% in 2007 as compared with 2.3% in 2006. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The Companys working capital changes were driven by higher levels of payables and accruals, primarily due to the timing of tax payments and higher advertising, offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances. Higher balances in accounts receivable were due primarily to higher Net sales in 2007. Days sales outstanding decreased slightly as compared to 2006. The inventory days coverage ratio increased to 73 in 2007 as compared to 69 in 2006 to ensure continued product supply during plant closings under the 2004 Restructuring Program.
24 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) With the progression of the 2004 Restructuring Program, pretax restructuring charges decreased $136.9, and cash spending decreased $12.8 in 2007 relative to the comparable period of 2006. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December31, 2007, will be paid out before year end 2008. It is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2004 Restructuring Program will continue to be funded from operating cash flows.
Investing activities used $528.3 of cash during 2007 compared with uses of $620.4 and $220.7 during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in uses as compared to 2006 is primarily due to lower payments for acquisitions and higher proceeds from the sale of property and non-core product lines, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.
In 2007, the Company increased its ownership interest in one of its subsidiaries in China to 100% at a cost of $26.5. In 2006, the Company purchased 84% of the outstanding shares of Toms of Maine, Inc., for approximately $100 plus transaction costs. Additionally, in 2006 the Company increased its ownership interests in its Poland and Romania subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of approximately $95. In 2005, the Company increased its ownership interests in certain subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of $38.5, primarily related to its Malaysia subsidiary.
Consistent with the Companys strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, investing activities include proceeds from the sale of certain non-core product lines. Investing activities in 2007 include $66.5 of net proceeds from the sale of the Companys Latin American household bleach business and $43.2 of proceeds from the sale of other property related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. Investing activities include $55.0 of proceeds from the sale of the Companys Canadian household bleach business in 2006 and $215.6 of proceeds from the sale of the Companys Southeast Asian and North American heavy-duty detergent brands in 2005.
Capital expenditures were $583.1, $476.4 and $389.2 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital spending is trending upwards as a result of the Companys multi-year restructuring and business-building program and continues to focus primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Overall capital expenditures for 2008 are expected to remain consistent at an annual rate of approximately 4.5% of Net sales.
Financing activities used $1,754.4 of cash during 2007 compared to $1,059.0 and $1,524.4 during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to higher purchases of treasury shares and a net reduction of debt. The decrease in 2006 was primarily related to proceeds from exercise of stock options and proceeds from debt.
The Company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. In October 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 20million shares of the Companys common stock through December31, 2005 (the 2004 Program) and, in December 2005, the Board of Directors extended this authorization through March31, 2006. The Company completed this program in the first quarter of 2006. In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the 2006 Program) under which the Company may purchase up to 30million common shares. On January30, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program (the 2008 Program) that replaces the 2006 Program and authorizes the Company to purchase up to 30million common shares. Aggregate repurchases in 2007 included 15.8million common shares under the 2006 Program and 5.0million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans for a total purchase price of $1,269.4. Aggregate repurchases in 2006 included 14.0million common shares under the 2004 and 2006 Programs and 1.0million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans for a total purchase price of $884.7. Aggregate repurchases in 2005 included 14.0million common shares under the 2004 Program and 1.1million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans for a total purchase price of $796.2.
Dividend payments in 2007 were $749.6, up from $677.8 in 2006 and $607.2 in 2005. Common stock dividend payments increased to $1.40 per share in 2007 from $1.25 per share in 2006 and $1.11 per share in 25 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2005. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments increased to $11.20 per share in 2007 from $10.00 per share in 2006 and $8.88 per share in 2005. Management currently intends to continue to pay dividends at increasing annual amounts per share from cash provided by operations.
In 2005, financing activities reflect a cash payment of $89.7 to an outside investor as a result of the discontinuation of a financing subsidiary of the Company. The Company previously had a financing subsidiary with outside equity investors, the purpose of which was to purchase some of the Companys receivables and thereby give the Company access to additional sources of capital. The subsidiary, including such receivables, was consolidated and the amounts invested by outside investors were reported as a minority interest.
Long-term debt decreased to $3,360.0 as of December31, 2007 as compared to $3,497.1 as of December31, 2006 and total debt decreased to $3,515.9 as of December31, 2007 as compared to $3,671.2 as of December31, 2006. The Companys long-term debt is rated AA- by Standard& Poors and Aa3 by Moodys Investors Service. During 2007, the Company issued 250million of Euro-denominated medium term notes (approximately $365 at the December31, 2007 exchange rate) maturing in June 2014, at a fixed interest rate of 4.75%, payable annually. The net proceeds of approximately $332 (248 million Euros) from the issuance were used to pay down U.S.-denominated commercial paper. During 2005, the Company issued 250million of Swiss franc-denominated five-year bonds (approximately $221 at the December31, 2007 exchange rate) at a fixed rate of 1.9%.
Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $478.8 and $651.6 as of December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is denominated in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and Canadian dollars. The maximum commercial paper outstanding during 2007 and 2006 was approximately $1,700 and $1,400, respectively. The average daily balance outstanding for U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper in 2007 and 2006 was $872.0 and $766.1, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard& Poors rating of A-1+ and a Moodys Investors Service rating of P-1. At December31, 2007 and 2006, commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable totaling $478.8 and $674.0, respectively, were classified as long-term debt, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its lines of credit that expire in 2012.
At December31, 2007, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,752.3 and also had $1,052.2 of medium-term notes available for issuance pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. The Companys domestic lines of credit include a five-year revolving credit facility of $1,500.0, which was extended an additional year in the fourth quarter of 2007 and now expires in November 2012. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper issuance.
The long-term notes of the Companys Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) that are guaranteed by the Company and certain amounts payable to banks contain cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote.
26 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Companys contractual obligations as of December31, 2007: Total Payments Due by Period 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Long-term debt including current portion (1) $ 3,352.4 $ 615.8 $ 99.6 $ 311.0 $ 621.1 $ 333.2 $ 1,371.7 Net cash interest payments on long-term debt (2) 1,619.6 202.6 136.4 128.3 119.8 79.2 953.3 Capitalized leases 7.6 1.1 1.2 1.1 1.1 1.1 2.0 Operating leases 590.4 134.9 117.3 88.4 68.3 66.2 115.3 Purchase obligations (3) 763.4 400.7 198.2 105.4 26.8 17.3 15.0 Total (4) $ 6,333.4 $ 1,355.1 $ 552.7 $ 634.2 $ 837.1 $ 497.0 $ 2,457.3 (1) Long-term debt due in 2008 includes $478.8 of commercial paper that has been classified as long-term debt as of December31, 2007, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its unused lines of credit that expire in 2012.
(2) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on managements best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.
(3) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2007 for raw, packaging and other materials in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.
(4) Long-term liabilities associated with the Companys postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates, below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plan until 2015. Managements best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the Companys assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December31, 2008, is approximately $95, including approximately $16 for other retiree benefit plans. These estimated cash requirements include approximately $53 of projected contributions to the Companys postretirement plans and approximately $42 of projected benefit payments made directly to participants of unfunded plans.
As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by the one-time impact of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, on-going results of operations or cash flows.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of 27 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Companys treasury and risk management policies. The Companys treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes.
As the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Companys major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in Europe, Asia/Africa and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.
The Company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts and currency options with durations no greater than 18 months.
Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Companys targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility.
The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, tallow, corn and soybeans. Futures and option contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. In 2007, the results of the Companys commodity hedging activities were not material.
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Companys policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long-term debt rating of AA-/Aa3 or higher.
Value at Risk The Companys risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value-at-risk (VAR) model and an earnings-at-risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity-based financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. Historical interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates.
The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of interest rate, foreign exchange rate or commodity-based instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2007 and 2006. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate, foreign exchange rate, or commodity-based instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Companys results of operations in 2007 and 2006. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, with certain requirements being effective in fiscal years beginning after 2008. The Company does not expect that SFAS 157 will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree, including the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination. Certain forms of contingent consideration and certain acquired contingencies will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. SFAS 141R also states acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred, and restructuring costs will be expensed in periods after the acquisition date. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial StatementsAn Amendment of ARB No.51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No.51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income; changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly, as equity transactions; and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating SFAS 160 and does not expect it will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Companys critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
29 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.
Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Companys gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent of sales would have decreased by 790 bps from 56.2% to 48.3% in 2007 and decreased 770 bps and 750 bps in 2006 and 2005, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.
The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (approximately 80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (approximately 20% of inventories). There would have been no impact on reported earnings for 2007, 2006 and 2005 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.
The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock options, asset impairment, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies.
In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for U.S. plans was 6.50%, 5.80% and 5.50% as of December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Companys international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 8.0% as of December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans investments, an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rate of return. The historical rate of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 15-year period was 9%. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 33% in fixed income securities (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term), 63% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 9.25% in the long-term) and 4% in real estate and other (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long-term). A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would cumulatively impact future Net income by approximately $10. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 4.0% as of December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. (Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys pension and other postretirement plans.)  The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase is 10% for 2008, declining 1%per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5%per year. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income by approximately $7.
Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), using the modified prospective method. SFAS 123R requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black- 30 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards under SFAS 123R. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December31, 2007, was $12.72. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include expected term of options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value. A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 13%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 4%.
Asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2004 Restructuring Program requires managements best estimate of net realizable value.
The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement.
Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.
Legal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the one-time impact of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, on-going results of operations or cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingencies.) The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Companys significant accounting policies.) Outlook Looking forward into 2008, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, it believes it is well positioned for continued growth. In order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share, the Company anticipates continuing to prioritize investments in key categories and markets and increasing momentum against its strategic initiatives: getting closer to the consumer, the profession and our customers; effectiveness and efficiency in everything; innovation everywhere; and leadership. The 2004 Restructuring Program is designed to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses. As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company is in the process of streamlining its global supply chain, reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high-potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with the Companys other on-going cost-savings and growth initiatives, are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability.
31 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) However, as noted above, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation. In addition, changes in economic conditions, movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. dollars. In particular, economic and political uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of Latin American and European currencies may impact the overall results of these regions. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries. Over the long-term, the Companys continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position it to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value.

Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys financial statements for external reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management evaluates the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007 and concluded that it is effective.
The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, and has expressed an unqualified opinion in their report which appears on page 40 of this report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Companys most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
As previously disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement with IBM in 2006 to provide certain procurement services globally and accounts payable services for Europe and North America. Pursuant to this agreement, management commenced the outsourcing of a portion of these activities in Europe and North America to IBM during the second quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2006, respectively. Management has implemented controls over the outsourced activities and continues to monitor the implementation by IBM. Accordingly, management believes that outsourcing these activities to IBM is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on internal control over financial reporting.

39 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Colgate-Palmolive Company In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Colgate-Palmolive Company and its subsidiaries at December31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As disclosed in Note 2, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based payment upon adoption of the accounting guidance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) on January1, 2006.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

44 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 1.Nature of Operations The Company manufactures and markets a wide variety of products in the U.S. and around the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Oral, Personal and Home Care products include toothpaste, oral rinses and toothbrushes, bar and liquid hand soaps, shower gels, shampoos, conditioners, deodorants and antiperspirants, shave products, laundry and dishwashing detergents, fabric conditioners, cleansers and cleaners, bleaches and other similar items. These products are sold primarily to wholesale and retail distributors worldwide. Pet Nutrition products include pet food products manufactured and marketed by Hills Pet Nutrition. The principal customers for Pet Nutrition products are veterinarians and specialty pet retailers. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, Mennen, Softsoap, Irish Spring, Protex, Sorriso, Kolynos, Elmex, Toms of Maine, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Soupline, Suavitel, Hills Science Diet and Hills Prescription Diet.
The Companys principal classes of products accounted for the following percentages of worldwide sales for the past three years: 2007 2006 2005 Oral Care 40 % 38 % 38 % Home Care 24 % 25 % 26 % Personal Care 23 % 23 % 23 % Pet Nutrition 13 % 14 % 13 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Colgate-Palmolive Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Companys investments in consumer products companies with interests ranging between 20% and 50% are accounted for using the equity method. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, equity method investments included in Other assets were $8.5 and $6.8, respectively. Investments with less than a 20% interest are accounted for using the cost method. Unrelated third parties hold the remaining ownership interest in these investments. Net income (loss) from such investments is recorded in Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. As such, the most significant uncertainty in the Companys assumptions and estimates involved in preparing the financial statements includes pension and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairment, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves. Additionally, the Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value, and accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates.
45 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Revenue Recognition Sales are recorded at the time products are shipped to trade customers and when risk of ownership transfers. Net sales reflect units shipped at selling list prices reduced by sales returns and the cost of current and continuing promotional programs. Current promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and co-operative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the period incurred. Continuing promotional programs are predominantly consumer coupons and volume-based sales incentive arrangements with trade customers. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience and is recorded when coupons are distributed. Volume-based incentives offered to trade customers are based on the estimated cost of the program and are recorded as products are sold.
Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are classified as Selling, general and administrative expenses and were $1,080.3, $942.7 and $860.2 for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Marketing Costs The Company markets its products through advertising and other promotional activities. Advertising costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of approximately 80% of inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of all other inventories, predominantly in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
Property, Plant and Equipment Land, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the Companys global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. These tests were performed and did not result in an impairment charge. Other intangible assets with finite lives, such as trademarks, local brands and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their useful lives, ranging from 5 to 40 years.
Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the differences between the financial statements and 46 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect at the time such differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Provision is made currently for taxes payable on remittances of overseas earnings; no provision is made for taxes on overseas retained earnings that are deemed to be permanently reinvested.
Effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.109. This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The impact of adoption of FIN 48 and discussion of related activity in 2007 are more fully described in Note 11. The Company recognizes interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense.
Financial Instruments Derivative instruments are recorded as assets and liabilities at estimated fair value based on available market information. The Companys derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are primarily designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, changes in fair value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged item, are recognized in earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the offsetting effect of the hedged item is also recognized in earnings. Cash flows related to fair value hedges and cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged item in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The Company may also enter into certain foreign currency and interest rate instruments that economically hedge certain of its risks but do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments, based on quoted market prices, are recognized in earnings each period.
Stock-Based Compensation Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R) using the modified prospective method, and, as such, results for prior periods have not been restated. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, stock option grants were accounted for in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and the Company adhered to the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123). SFAS 123R requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant over the requisite service period. Prior to January1, 2006, the value of restricted stock awards, based on market prices, was expensed by the Company over the restriction period, and no compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants as all such grants had an exercise price not less than fair market value on the date of grant.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards under SFAS 123R, which is consistent with the model used for the previous pro forma disclosure under SFAS 123.
47 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Stock-based compensation plans, related expenses and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are more fully described in Note 8.
Translation of Overseas Currencies The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories, goodwill and property, plant and equipment are translated at the rate of exchange on the date the assets were acquired, while other assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments for these operations are included in Net income.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, with certain requirements being effective in fiscal years beginning after 2008. The Company does not expect that SFAS 157 will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree, including the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination. Certain forms of contingent consideration and certain acquired contingencies will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. SFAS 141R also states acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred, and restructuring costs will be expensed in periods after the acquisition date. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial StatementsAn Amendment of ARB No.51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No.51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income; changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly, as equity transactions; and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating SFAS 160 and does not expect it will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.

3.Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions During 2007, the Company increased its ownership interest in one of its subsidiaries in China to 100% at a cost of $26.5.
On May1, 2006, the Company completed the purchase of 84% of the outstanding shares of Toms of Maine, Inc., for approximately $100 plus transaction costs. Toms of Maine gave Colgate the opportunity to enter the fast-growing health and specialty trade channel in the U.S. where Toms of Maine toothpaste and deodorants are market leaders. The cost to acquire Toms of Maine, Inc. was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition based on fair values. In the second quarter of 2007, the final purchase price allocation of the acquisition was completed. The results of Toms of Maine operations have been included in Colgates North American operating segment in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. The inclusion of pro forma financial data for Toms of Maine prior to the date of acquisition would not have had a material impact on reported Net sales, Net income or Earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005.
During 2006, the Company increased its ownership interests in its Poland and Romania subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of approximately $95. During 2005, the Company increased its ownership interests in certain subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of $38.5, primarily related to its Malaysia subsidiary.
Divestitures Consistent with the Companys strategy to prioritize higher-margin businesses, the Company sold its household bleach businesses in Latin America, excluding Colombia, and Canada in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The transaction included the sale of the bleach brands Javex, Agua Jane and Nevex in Canada, Uruguay and Venezuela, respectively, and the license of the Ajax brand for bleach during a transition period in the Dominican Republic and Ecuador. The transaction closed in the Latin American countries during the first quarter of 2007 with proceeds of $66.5, resulting in a pretax gain of $48.6 ($29.7 aftertax) included in Other (income) expense, net in 2007. The transaction closed in Canada during the fourth quarter of 2006 with proceeds of $55.0, resulting in a pretax gain of $46.5 ($38.2 aftertax) included in Other (income) expense, net in 2006. These operations were not material to the Companys annual Net sales, Net income or Earnings per share.
During 2005, the Company sold its North American and Southeast Asian heavy-duty laundry detergent businesses. These operations accounted for less than 2% of the Companys annual Net sales. The aggregate proceeds from these sales were $215.6, resulting in a pretax gain of $147.9 ($93.5 aftertax) included in Other (income) expense, net.
4.Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges The Companys previously announced four-year restructuring and business-building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses is progressing on schedule. On April24, 2007, the Company expanded the 2004 Restructuring Program to encompass additional savings projects identified by the Company during the course of implementing the program. These 49 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) additional projects will not extend the length of the program beyond the anticipated completion date of December31, 2008. Including the expansion, the cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all the projects are approved and implemented, totaling between $1,000 and $1,075 ($725 and $775 aftertax). It is estimated that the total cumulative pretax charges of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program, once completed, will be comprised of the following: termination benefits (40%), incremental depreciation (20%), asset impairments (5%)and other charges consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%)and the implementation of new strategies (15%). Over the course of the four-year 2004 Restructuring Program, it is estimated that approximately 50%-60% of the charges will result in cash expenditures.
For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 restructuring and implementation-related charges are reflected in the income statement as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Cost of sales $ 153.8 $ 196.2 $ 100.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 49.1 46.1 1.8 Other (income) expense, net 55.6 153.1 80.8 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges, pretax $ 258.5 $ 395.4 $ 182.8 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges, aftertax $ 183.7 $ 286.3 $ 145.1 Restructuring charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these decisions are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.
Total 2007 charges relate to the 2004 Restructuring Program in North America (36%), Europe/South Pacific (22%), Latin America (3%), Greater Asia/Africa (14%)and Corporate (25%). Total program-to-date accumulated charges relate to the 2004 Restructuring Program in North America (38%), Europe/South Pacific (29%), Latin America (4%), Greater Asia/Africa (9%)and Corporate (20%). Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred total pretax cumulative charges of $905.4 ($663.1 aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects as follows: CumulativeCharges asofDecember31,2007 Termination Benefits $ 393.8 Incremental Depreciation 201.5 Asset Impairments 59.1 Other 251.0 Total cumulative 2004 Restructuring Program charges, pretax $ 905.4 The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following significant projects: the voluntary early retirement program in the U.S.; the closing of the Jeffersonville, Indiana, oral care facility; the consolidation of toothpaste production in Europe; exiting certain manufacturing activities in other categories in Portugal, Denmark, Puerto Rico, Senegal and Kansas City, Kansas; and the realignment of sales, administrative and research and development functions in various locations around the world.
50 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring charges discussed above and the related accrual: Termination Benefits Incremental Depreciation Asset Impairments Other Total Balance at December31, 2004 $ 41.7 $  $  $ 0.4 $ 42.1 Charges 58.6 65.3 30.2 28.7 182.8 Cash payments (47.8 )   (23.4 ) (71.2 ) Charges against assets (11.4 ) (65.3 ) (30.2 ) (6.4 ) (113.3 ) Other (1.4 )   4.2 2.8 Foreign exchange (4.4 )   (0.1 ) (4.5 ) Balance at December31, 2005 $ 35.3 $  $  $ 3.4 $ 38.7 Charges 212.7 91.5 6.6 84.6 395.4 Cash payments (89.7 )   (75.3 ) (165.0 ) Charges against assets (98.4 ) (91.5 ) (6.6 ) (6.7 ) (203.2 ) Other (10.0 )   5.2 (4.8 ) Foreign exchange 3.5   0.1 3.6 Balance at December31, 2006 $ 53.4 $  $  $ 11.3 $ 64.7 Charges 80.9 41.4 0.3 135.9 258.5 Cash payments (65.3 )   (137.4 ) (202.7 ) Charges against assets (14.1 ) (41.4 ) (0.3 ) (4.6 ) (60.4 ) Other (2.2 )   3.6 1.4 Foreign exchange 1.9   0.2 2.1 Balance at December31, 2007 $ 54.6 $  $  $ 9.0 $ 63.6 Termination benefits incurred pursuant to the 2004 Restructuring Program are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Termination benefits also include pension enhancements of $14.1 and $98.4 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Termination benefits in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets. In 2007 and 2006, Termination benefits also include $2.2 and $10.0, respectively, of charges related to other retiree benefit enhancements and are reflected in Other charges as an increase to other retiree benefit liabilities. In 2007 and 2006, the Company made voluntary contributions of $34.5 and $85.0, respectively, to partially fund this obligation. The Company anticipates that it will continue to make incremental cash contributions to its plans in order to fund its restructuring-related pension obligations over the duration of the 2004 Restructuring Program.
Incremental depreciation was recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset impairments have been recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.
Other charges primarily consist of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2004 Restructuring Program. These charges include ramp-down costs related to the closure of existing facilities, start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental 51 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. For the year ended December31, 2007 charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities were $33.2, and costs incurred for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives were $37.9. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred $40.7 of charges related to start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities and $70.3 of costs for the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives. All costs relating to start-up costs for new facilities and third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives are expensed as incurred.
5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The net carrying value of Goodwill as of December31, 2007 and 2006, by segment is as follows: 2007 2006 Oral, Personal and Home Care North America $ 371.7 $ 345.8 Latin America 637.1 568.1 Europe/South Pacific 1,050.4 980.2 Greater Asia/Africa 197.8 172.7 Total Oral, Personal and Home Care 2,257.0 2,066.8 Pet Nutrition 15.0 15.0 Total Goodwill $ 2,272.0 $ 2,081.8 Other intangible assets as of December31, 2007 and 2006, are comprised of the following: 2007 2006 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Trademarks $ 457.2 $ (186.9 ) $ 270.3 $ 435.3 $ (155.8 ) $ 279.5 Other finite life intangible assets 42.5 (14.4 ) 28.1 26.6 (8.1 ) 18.5 Indefinite life intangible assets 546.4  546.4 533.1  533.1 Total Other intangible assets $ 1,046.1 $ (201.3 ) $ 844.8 $ 995.0 $ (163.9 ) $ 831.1 The changes in the net carrying amounts of Goodwill and Other intangible assets during 2007 are mainly due to the impact of foreign currency translation of $193, acquisition of patents of $20 and an increase in the Companys ownership in one of its China subsidiaries of $16, offset primarily by amortization expense.
Amortization expense of the above trademarks and other finite life intangible assets was $18.2 for the year ended December31, 2007. Annual estimated amortization expense for each of the next five years is expected to be approximately $18.

Excluding commercial paper reclassified as long-term debt, scheduled maturities of long-term debt and capitalized leases outstanding as of December31, 2007, are as follows: YearsEndedDecember31, 2008 $ 138.1 2009 100.8 2010 312.1 2011 622.2 2012 334.3 Thereafter 1,373.7 The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts related to certain of these debt instruments (see Note 7).
During 2007, the Company issued 250million of Euro-denominated medium term notes (approximately $365 at the December31, 2007 exchange rate) maturing in June 2014 at a fixed interest rate of 4.75%, payable annually. The net proceeds of approximately $332 (248 million Euros) from the issuance were used to pay down U.S.-denominated commercial paper.
At December31, 2007, the Company had unused credit facilities amounting to $2,752.3 and also had $1,052.2 of medium-term notes available for issuance pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. The Companys domestic lines of credit include a five-year revolving credit facility of $1,500.0 with a syndicate of banks, which was extended an additional year in the fourth quarter of 2007 and now expires in November 2012. Commitment fees related to credit facilities are not material. The weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings included in Notes and loans payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December31, 2007 and 2006 was 5.3% and 5.2%, respectively.
The ESOP notes guaranteed by the Company and certain credit facilities contain cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote.
53 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 7.Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates.
Derivative Instruments Following are the notional amounts and net recorded fair values of the Companys derivative instruments: 2007 2006 Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Interest rate swap contracts $ 120.0 $ (0.2 ) $ 239.1 $ 2.2 Foreign currency contracts 1,468.7 (0.8 ) 1,269.3 (14.5 ) Commodity contracts 17.5 2.9 16.2 2.9 The Company utilizes interest rate swap contracts to manage its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Forward and swap contracts are utilized to hedge a portion of the Companys foreign currency purchases, and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. The Company also uses these contracts to hedge the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. Forward contracts used in hedging forecasted foreign currency purchases have durations no greater than 18 months. Commodity contracts are utilized to hedge the purchases of raw materials used in the Companys operations. These contracts generally range from one to 12 months and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. It is the Companys policy to enter into derivative instruments with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. As such, the Companys derivative instruments are considered highly effective, and the net gain or loss from hedge ineffectiveness was not material.
Cumulative losses related to foreign currency and commodity contracts designated as cash flow hedges, which are expected to be recognized in earnings over the next 12 months when the offsetting effects of the hedged item are also recorded in earnings, are not material.
Other Financial Instruments The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, long-term investments and short-term debt approximated fair value as of December31, 2007 and 2006. The estimated fair value of the Companys long-term debt, including current portion, as of December31, 2007 and 2006, was $3,496.1 and $3,584.5, respectively, and the related carrying value was $3,360.0 and $3,497.1, respectively.
Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Companys policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long-term debt rating of AA-/Aa3 or higher.
54 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 8.Capital Stock and Stock-Based Compensation Plans Preference Stock The Company has the authority to issue 50,000,000 shares of preference stock. In 1989, the Company approved the issuance of 6,315,149 shares of Series B Convertible Preference Stock (the Preference Stock) without par value. Each share of Preference Stock, which is convertible into eight shares of common stock, has a redemption price of $65 per share and pays cumulative dividends equal to the higher of $2.44 or the current dividend paid on eight common shares for the comparable six-month period. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, there were 3,037,758 and 3,426,737 shares of Preference Stock, respectively, outstanding and issued to the Companys Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
Stock Repurchases The Company repurchased stock at a cost of $1,269.4 during 2007. In 2007, the Company repurchased its common stock under a share repurchase program that was approved by the Board of Directors and publicly announced in March 2006 (the 2006 Program). Under the 2006 Program, the Company was authorized to purchase up to 30million shares of the Companys common stock. The Boards authorization also authorized share repurchases on an on-going basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Companys compensation and benefit programs.
The Company may use either authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock awards.
Prior to the Boards approval of the 2006 Program, the Company purchased its shares under a program that was approved by the Board of Directors and publicly announced in October 2004 (the 2004 Program). Under the 2004 Program, the Company was authorized to purchase up to 20million shares of the Companys common stock.
On January30, 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2008 Program) that replaced, as of the close of business on January30, 2008, the 2006 Program. The 2008 Program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 30million shares of common stock over the next two years. The shares may be repurchased in open-market or privately negotiated transactions at the Companys discretion, subject to market conditions, customary blackout periods and other factors. The Boards authorization also authorizes share repurchases on an on-going basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Companys compensation and benefit programs.
Stock-Based Compensation Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method and, as such, results for prior periods have not been restated. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, stock option grants were accounted for in accordance with APB 25, and the Company adhered to the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS 123. Prior to January1, 2006, the value of restricted stock awards, based on market prices, was expensed by the Company over the restriction period, and no compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants as all such grants had an exercise price not less than fair market value on the date of grant.
SFAS 123R requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the 55 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) date of grant. The value of restricted stock awards, based on market prices, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award.
SFAS 123R also requires that new awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested be recognized as compensation cost over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. The Companys stock options and restricted stock awards granted to eligible participants prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R that had an accelerated vesting feature associated with employee retirement continue to be recognized, as required, as compensation cost over the vesting period except in the instance of the participants actual retirement.
The Company has two stock-based compensation plans, which are described below. The total stock-based compensation expense charged against pretax income for these plans was $110.3, $116.9 and $41.1 for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized on stock-based compensation was approximately $36.8, $38.2 and $14.4 for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As a result of adopting SFAS 123R on January1, 2006, incremental stock-based compensation expense recognized for the year ended December31, 2006 was $69.8 ($48.1 aftertax), which impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.09.
Stock-based compensation expense is recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Corporate segment as these amounts are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.
The following illustrates the effect on Net income and Earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value method of SFAS 123 prior to January1, 2006: 2005 Net income, as reported $ 1,351.4 Less: pro forma stock option compensation expense, net of tax 42.9 Pro forma net income $ 1,308.5 Earnings per share: Basicas reported $ 2.54 Basicpro forma 2.46 Dilutedas reported 2.43 Dilutedpro forma 2.35 The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards under SFAS 123R, which is consistent with the model used for the previous pro forma disclosure under SFAS 123. The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted in the year ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $12.72, $10.30 and $9.59, respectively. Fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the assumptions summarized in the following table: 2007 2006 2005 Expected Term of Options 4years 4years 4years Expected Volatility Rate 21 % 17 % 20 % Risk-Free Rate 4.2 % 4.8 % 4.0 % Expected Dividend Yield 2.1 % 2.1 % 2.0 % 56 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The weighted-average expected option term reflects the application of the simplified method set out in Staff Accounting Bulletin No.107 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which defines the term as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted-average vesting period for all option tranches. Expected volatility incorporates implied share-price volatility derived from exchange traded options on the Companys common stock. Prior to 2006, such assumptions were determined based on historical data. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury implied yield at the time of grant.
The Company elected to use the transition guidance for calculating the opening pool of windfall tax benefits as prescribed in SFAS 123R effective January1, 2006 instead of the alternative transition method as prescribed in FAS 123(R)-3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payments Awards.
Incentive Stock Plan The Company has a plan that provides for grants of restricted stock awards for officers and other employees. A committee of independent members of the Board of Directors administers the plan. The awarded shares are made in common stock and vest at the end of the restriction period, which is generally three years.
Restricted stock award activity for the year ended December31, 2007, is summarized below: Shares (inthousands) Weighted AverageGrant DateFairValue Per Award Restricted stock awards as of January 1 3,116 $ 55 Activity: Granted 743 67 Vested (1,236 ) 54 Forfeited (51 ) 57 Restricted stock awards as of December 31 2,572 $ 59 As of December31, 2007, there was $47.1 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $78.3, $28.2 and $28.3, respectively.
57 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Stock Option Plans The Companys Stock Option Plans provide for the issuance of non-qualified stock options to officers and other employees that have a contractual term of six years and generally vest over three years. As of December31, 2007, approximately 27,235,000 shares of common stock were available for future stock option grants.
A summary of stock option plan activity as of December31, 2007, is presented below: Shares (inthousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining ContractualLife (inyears) Value of Unexercised In-the-Money Options Options outstanding, January1 37,952 $ 54 Granted 4,515 68 Exercised (13,780 ) 51 Forfeited or expired (313 ) 56 Options outstanding, December31 28,374 57 4 $ 586 Options exercisable, December31 19,612 $ 55 3 $ 456 As of December31, 2007, there was $41.9 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to options, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The total value of options exercised during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $289.8, $78.2 and $34.2, respectively.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company presented the benefit of all tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock awards as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The benefits of tax deductions in excess of grant date fair value was $65.4 and was reported as a financing cash flow in 2007. Cash proceeds received from options exercised for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $423.9, $354.0 and $47.1, respectively.
9. Employee Stock Ownership Plan In 1989, the Company expanded its Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) through the introduction of a leveraged ESOP that funds certain benefits for employees who have met eligibility requirements. The ESOP issued $410.0 of long-term notes due through 2009 bearing an average interest rate of 8.7%. The remaining balance of the long-term notes, which are guaranteed by the Company, is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ESOP used the proceeds of the notes to purchase 6.3million shares of Preference Stock from the Company. The Preference Stock, which is convertible into eight shares of common stock, has a redemption price of $65 per share and pays semiannual dividends equal to the higher of $2.44 or the current dividend paid on eight common shares for the comparable six-month period. During 2000, the ESOP entered into a loan agreement with the Company under which the benefits of the ESOP may be extended through 2035.
Dividends on the Preference Stock, as well as on the common shares also held by the ESOP, are paid to the ESOP trust and, together with cash contributions and advances from the Company, are used by the ESOP to repay principal and interest on the outstanding notes. Preference Stock is released for allocation to participants 58 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) based upon the ratio of the current years debt service to the sum of total principal and interest payments over the life of the loans. As of December31, 2007, 1,306,195 shares were released and allocated to participant accounts, and 1,731,563 shares were available for future allocation.
Dividends on the Preference Stock are deductible for income tax purposes and, accordingly, are reflected net of their tax benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Retained Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Changes in Capital Accounts.
Annual expense related to the leveraged ESOP, determined as interest incurred on the original notes, plus the higher of either principal payments or the historical cost of Preference Stock allocated, less dividends received on the shares held by the ESOP and advances from the Company, was $12.2 in 2007, $14.1 in 2006 and $11.9 in 2005. Unearned compensation, which is shown as a reduction in shareholders equity, represents the amount of ESOP debt outstanding reduced by the difference between the cumulative cost of Preference Stock allocated and the cumulative principal payments.
Interest incurred on the ESOPs notes was $13.4 in 2007, $17.9 in 2006 and $21.7 in 2005. The Company paid dividends on the shares held by the ESOP of $35.8 in 2007, $37.0 in 2006 and $36.9 in 2005. Company contributions to the ESOP were $12.2 in 2007, $14.1 in 2006 and $11.9 in 2005.
10. Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits Retirement Plans The Company, its U.S. subsidiaries and some of its overseas subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all of their employees. Benefits are based primarily on years of service and employees career earnings. In the Companys principal U.S. plans, funds are contributed to the trusts in accordance with regulatory limits to provide for current service and for any unfunded projected benefit obligation over a reasonable period. Assets of the plans consist principally of common stocks, guaranteed investment contracts with insurance companies, U.S. government and corporate obligations and investments in real estate funds. The asset allocation for the Companys defined benefit plans at the end of 2007 and 2006 and the target allocation by asset category are as follows: United States International Target 2007 Actual 2006 Actual Target 2007 Actual 2006 Actual Asset Category Equity securities 63 % 69 % 66 % 51 % 50 % 52 % Debt securities 33 26 30 41 42 43 Real estate and other 4 5 4 8 8 5 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Equity securities in the U.S. plans include investments in the Companys common stock representing 9% of U.S. plan assets at December31, 2007, and 8% of plan assets at December31, 2006. Such plans purchased approximately 28,600 and 59,200 shares in 2007 and 2006, respectively, using the proceeds from dividends on previously purchased Company stock. In 2007, 435,523 shares of the Companys common stock were sold. No shares were sold in 2006. The plans received dividends on the Companys common stock of approximately $2 in 2007 and 2006.
59 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The overall investment objective is to balance risk and return so that obligations to employees are met. The Company evaluates its long-term rate of return on plan assets on an annual basis. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans investments, an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rates of return. The assumed rate of return for 2007 for the U.S. plans was 8%. Historical rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 15-year period were approximately 9%. Similar assessments were performed in determining rates of returns on international pension plan assets to arrive at the Companys current weighted-average rate of return of 6.7%.
Other Retiree Benefits The Company and certain of its subsidiaries provide health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees to the extent not provided by government-sponsored plans. The Company utilizes a portion of its leveraged ESOP to reduce its obligation to provide these other retiree benefits and to offset its current service cost. Additionally, during 2007 and 2006 the Company made contributions of $7.0 and $7.6, respectively, to fund the payment of future postretirement medical benefits, the maximum permitted under U.S. tax regulations.

Charges in 2007 relating to certain one-time termination benefits incurred pursuant to the 2004 Restructuring Program amounted to $16.3. During 2007, the Company made voluntary contributions of $45.0 (including $34.5 related to restructuring) to its U.S. postretirement plans. Other 2007 charges required by SFAS No.88, Employers Accounting for Settlement and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits (SFAS 88), amounted to $23.6 and pertained primarily to lump sum payments of normal retirement benefits associated with retirement plans in the U.S.

During 2006, the Company made voluntary contributions of $111.0 (including $85.0 related to restructuring) to its U.S. postretirement plans. Other 2006 charges required by SFAS 88 amounted to $1.7, including $0.8 pertaining to a curtailment resulting from the 2004 Restructuring Program.
Other postretirement charges in 2005, relating to certain one-time termination benefits incurred pursuant to the 2004 Restructuring Program, amounted to $12.8. Additionally, other postretirement charges in 2005 included a non-cash charge of $9.2 associated with an international postretirement obligation and other 2005 charges required by SFAS 88 amounted to $26.9. Other SFAS 88 charges included the conversion of one of the Companys international pension plans to a defined contribution plan for all eligible participants for $10.6 and a lump sum payment of normal retirement benefits associated with a retirement plan in the U.S. for $14.2.
Termination benefits incurred pursuant to the 2004 Restructuring Program in 2007, 2006 and 2005 are reflected as a restructuring charge; however, the related accrual resides in pension and other retiree benefit assets and liabilities at December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in Other Comprehensive Income were as follows: Before-Tax Amount TaxExpense (Benefit) Net-of-Tax Amount Net actuarial loss (gain) arising during the period $ (193.7 ) $ 68.7 $ (125.0 ) Amortization of transition& prior service (costs) credits (6.7 ) 2.5 (4.2 ) Amortization of actuarial (loss) gain (54.0 ) 19.3 (34.7 ) Total $ (254.4 ) $ 90.5 $ (163.9 ) The estimated actuarial loss and the estimated transition/prior service cost for defined benefit and other retiree benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is as follows: PensionBenefits OtherRetiree Benefits Actuarial loss $ 7.3 $ 8.9 Transition& prior service cost 4.4 (0.1 ) Expected Contributions& Benefit Payments Managements best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the Companys assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December31, 2008, is approximately $95, including approximately $16 for other retiree benefit plans. These estimated cash requirements include approximately $53 of projected contributions to the Companys postretirement plans and approximately $42 of projected benefit payments made directly to participants of unfunded plans. Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the assets as compared to the obligation and other market or regulatory conditions. Accordingly, actual funding may differ from current estimates.

65 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The difference between the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate and the Companys global effective tax rate as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income is as follows: Percentage of Income before income taxes 2007 2006 2005 Tax at United States statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 0.9 0.8 0.9 Effect of American Jobs Creation Act   2.0 Earnings taxed at other than United States statutory rate 0.2 (1.2 ) (1.5 ) Reduction of valuation allowances (4.5 ) (0.9 )  Other, net (1.2 ) (1.3 ) (1.4 ) Effective tax rate 30.4 % 32.4 % 35.0 % Generally, the changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and the corresponding impact on the effective tax rate results from managements assessment of the Companys ability to utilize certain operating loss and tax carryforwards prior to expiration. The rate reduction in 2007 and 2006 primarily reflects the reversal of a valuation allowance in Brazil as discussed below.
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA), which was enacted in October 2004, created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends. The Company repatriated $780 in incremental foreign earnings in the second half of 2005 at a full year tax cost of approximately $40.9.
The components of deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows at December31: 2007 2006 Deferred tax liabilities: Intangible assets $ (432.3 ) $ (380.9 ) Property, plant and equipment (226.8 ) (233.4 ) Other (101.0 ) (150.5 ) (760.1 ) (764.8 ) Deferred tax assets: Pension and other retiree benefits 178.4 259.2 Tax loss and tax credit carryforwards 210.8 189.4 Accrued liabilities 97.8 77.3 Stock-based compensation 63.5 57.1 Other 81.3 94.2 Valuation allowance (10.8 ) (125.4 ) 621.0 551.8 Net deferred income taxes $ (139.1 ) $ (213.0 ) Deferred taxes included within: Assets: Other current assets $ 125.0 $ 96.9 Liabilities: Deferred income taxes (264.1 ) (309.9 ) Net deferred income taxes $ (139.1 ) $ (213.0 ) 66 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The major component of the valuation allowance as of December31, 2007 and 2006 relates to tax benefits in certain jurisdictions arising from net operating losses and related tax loss carryforwards. On an on-going basis, the Company reassesses the need for such valuation allowances based on recent operating results, its assessment of the likelihood of future taxable income and developments in the relevant tax jurisdictions. As a result of such a reassessment, and in light of positive operating results in Brazil, the realization of these deferred tax assets in Brazil is probable and as such, the Company reduced its valuation allowance in the first quarter of 2007 by $94.6.
Applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $2,300 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries at December31, 2007. These earnings have been and are currently considered to be permanently invested and are currently not subject to such taxes. Determining the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were remitted is not practicable.
In addition, net tax benefits of $49.6 in 2007, $258.0 in 2006 and $12.0 in 2005 recorded directly through equity predominantly include tax benefits related to employee equity compensation and benefit plans. The increase in net tax benefits recorded directly through equity in 2006 was primarily related to the implementation of SFAS 158.
The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesAn Interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN 48), on January1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized a $4.0 increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which, as required, was accounted for as a reduction to the January1, 2007, balance of Retained earnings.
Unrecognized tax benefits activity for the year ended December31, 2007 is summarized below: 2007 Unrecognized tax benefits: Balance, January1 183.5 Increases as a result of tax positions taken during the current year 48.1 Increases of tax positions taken during prior years 4.8 Decreases of tax positions taken during prior years (21.4 ) Decreases relating to settlements with taxing authorities (17.5 ) Effect of foreign currency rate movements 1.8 Balance, December31 $ 199.3 If all of the unrecognized tax benefits above were recognized, approximately $166 would impact the effective tax rate. It is possible that up to one-fourth of the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved in the next 12 months.
The Company recognized approximately $9 of interest expense related to the above unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense in 2007. The Company had accrued interest of approximately $33 and $23 as of December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. While the statutes of limitations may not have expired, all U.S federal income tax returns for the periods ended through December31,2005 have been audited by and settled with the Internal Revenue Service. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. state and local income tax examination for the years prior to 2003. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in various foreign jurisdictions that have statutes of limitations generally ranging from 3 to 6 years.

13.Commitments and Contingencies Minimum rental commitments under noncancellable operating leases, primarily for office and warehouse facilities, are $134.9 in 2008, $117.3 in 2009, $88.4 in 2010, $68.3 in 2011, $66.2 in 2012 and $115.3 thereafter. Rental expense amounted to $157.4 in 2007, $142.6 in 2006 and $130.6 in 2005. Capital leases included in fixed assets, contingent rentals and sublease income are not significant. The Company has various contractual commitments to purchase raw, packaging and other materials totaling approximately $763.4.
The Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising out of the normal course of business.
Management proactively reviews and monitors its exposure to, and the impact of, environmental matters. The Company is a potentially responsible party to various environmental matters and as such may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup, restoration and post-closure monitoring of several sites. Substantially all of the Companys potential liability for these matters relates to a single superfund site associated with a prior acquisition. Substantially all of the Companys potential liability that may arise in connection with this site has been acknowledged in writing as being covered by the Companys insurance carriers, which are presently making all their required payments and are expected to continue to do so in the future. While it is possible that the nonperformance of other potentially responsible parties or the Companys insurance carriers could affect the cash flows and results of operations in any particular quarter or year, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the financial position or on-going results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities around the world in countries where it conducts business. In this regard, the IRS has completed its examination of the Companys federal income tax returns for 1996 through 2005. The amount of additional tax involved as a result of assessments arising from the IRS examination did not have a material impact on the 68 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. Estimated incremental tax payments related to the potential disallowances for subsequent periods are insignificant.
In May 2006, one of the Companys subsidiaries received an assessment from the Mexican tax authorities totaling approximately $635, at the current exchange rate, including interest and penalties, challenging Value Added Tax (VAT) credits claimed in its 2000 and 2001 VAT returns. In December 2006, another subsidiary of the Company received an income tax assessment from the Mexican tax authorities totaling approximately $190, at the current exchange rate, including interest and penalties, challenging the transfer pricing on transactions between that subsidiary and another of the Companys subsidiaries located in the United States. The Company, through its subsidiary, requested and received in 1999 a written advance ruling from the Mexican tax authorities for both VAT and income tax on which the Company relied in subsequently claiming on its returns the VAT credits and income tax treatment to which these assessments relate. The Company believes based on the advice of outside counsel that its tax filings are in full compliance with the written advance ruling and applicable tax law and regulations. However, the Company has entered into settlement discussions with the Mexican tax authorities regarding these matters. If such discussions are not resolved to the Companys satisfaction, it intends to vigorously challenge the assessments in the Mexican court system and through discussions between Mexican and U.S.government authorities pursuant to the income tax treaty between the countries. Although there can be no assurances, the Company believes based on the advice of outside counsel that ultimately it will prevail in the VAT matter and that the transfer pricing dispute will not result in a material financial exposure to the Company.
In 1995, the Company acquired the Kolynos oral care business from Wyeth (formerly American Home Products) (the Seller), as described in the Companys Form 8-K dated January10, 1995. On September8, 1998, the Companys Brazilian subsidiary received notice of an administrative proceeding from the Central Bank of Brazil primarily taking issue with certain foreign exchange filings made with the Central Bank in connection with the financing of this strategic transaction but in no way challenging or seeking to unwind the acquisition. The Central Bank of Brazil in January 2001 notified the Company of its decision in this administrative proceeding to impose a fine, which, at the current exchange rate, approximates $147. The Company appealed the imposition of the fine to the Brazilian Monetary System Appeals Council (the Council), and on January30, 2007, the Council decided the appeal in the Companys favor, dismissing the fine entirely.
In addition, the Brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the Companys Brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the Kolynos acquisition. The tax assessments with interest, at the current exchange rate, approximate $123. The Company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments within the internal revenue authoritys appellate process with the following results to date:  In June 2005, the First Board of Taxpayers ruled in the Companys favor and allowed all of the previously claimed deductions for 1996 through 1998, which represent more than half of the total exposure. The tax authorities have appealed this decision to the next administrative level.
In March 2007, the First Board of Taxpayers ruled in the Companys favor and allowed all of the previously claimed deductions for 1999 through 2001, which represent the remaining exposure. The tax authorities could appeal this decision to the next administrative level.
In the event of an adverse decision within the internal revenue authoritys appellate process, further appeals are available within the Brazilian federal courts. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel and other experts, that the disallowances are without merit and that the Company should prevail on appeal either at the administrative level or, if necessary, in the Brazilian federal courts. The Company intends to challenge these assessments vigorously.
69 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) In addition, Brazilian prosecutors reviewed the foregoing transactions as part of an overall examination of all international transfers of Reais through non-resident current accounts during the 1992 to 1998 time frame, a review that the Company understands involved hundreds and possibly thousands of other individuals and companies unrelated to the Company. At the request of these prosecutors, in February 2004, a federal judge agreed to authorize criminal charges against certain current and former officers of the Companys Brazilian subsidiary based on the same allegations made in the Central Bank and tax proceedings discussed above. Management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that these officers behaved in all respects properly and in accordance with the law in connection with the financing of the Kolynos acquisition. Management intends to support and defend these officers vigorously.
In 2002, the Brazilian Federal Public Attorney filed a civil action against the federal government of Brazil, Laboratorios Wyeth-Whitehall Ltda., the Brazilian subsidiary of the Seller, and the Company, as represented by its Brazilian subsidiary, seeking to annul an April 2000 decision by the Brazilian Board of Tax Appeals that found in favor of the Sellers subsidiary on the issue of whether it had incurred taxable capital gains as a result of the divestiture of Kolynos. The action seeks to make the Companys Brazilian subsidiary jointly and severally liable for any tax due from the Sellers subsidiary. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that the Company should ultimately prevail in this action. The Company intends to challenge this action vigorously.
In December 2005, the Brazilian internal revenue authority issued to the Companys Brazilian subsidiary a tax assessment with interest and penalties of approximately $64 at the current exchange rate, based on a claim that certain purchases of U.S. Treasury bills by the subsidiary and their subsequent disposition during the period 2000 to 2001 were subject to a tax on foreign exchange transactions. The Company is disputing the assessment within the internal revenue authoritys administrative appeals process. In October 2007, the Second Board of Taxpayers ruled in favor of the internal revenue authority. The Company intends to appeal this decision to the next administrative level. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that the tax assessment is without merit and that the Company should prevail either through administrative appeal or, if necessary, through further appeal in the Brazilian federal courts. The Company intends to challenge this assessment vigorously.
In February 2006, the Company learned that French competition authorities initiated an inquiry into potential competition law violations in France involving exchanges of competitive information and agreements on selling terms and conditions among a number of consumer goods companies in France, including the Companys French subsidiary. In February 2007, the Company learned that the Swiss competition authorities opened an investigation against the Companys GABA Holding AG (GABA) subsidiary regarding distribution policies, retail pricing and parallel trade. Governmental investigations or proceedings relating to competition law involving the Company have also been commenced in Romania and Germany. At this time, no formal claim for a fine or penalty has been made against the Company in any of the above matters. In February 2008, the federal competition authority in Germany imposed fines on four of the Companys competitors, but the Company was not fined due to its cooperation with the German authorities, consistent with the policy described below. The Companys policy is to comply with antitrust and competition laws and, if a violation of any such laws is found, to take appropriate remedial action and to cooperate fully with any related governmental inquiry. The Company has undertaken a comprehensive review of its selling practices and related competition law compliance in Europe and elsewhere and, where the Company has identified a lack of compliance, it is undertaking remedial action. While the Company cannot predict the final financial impact of these competition law issues as these matters may change, the Company has taken and will, if necessary, take additional reserves as appropriate.
70 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) In October 2007, a putative class action claiming that certain aspects of the cash balance portion of the Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees Retirement Income Plan (the Plan) do not comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act was filed against the Plan and the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Specifically, Proesel, et al. v. Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees Retirement Income Plan, et al.
, alleges improper calculation of lump sum distributions, age discrimination and failure to satisfy minimum accrual requirements, thereby resulting in the underpayment of benefits to Plan participants. The Company is seeking to consolidate this case with two other putative class actions filed earlier in 2007 ( Abelman, et al. v. Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees Retirement Income Plan, et al.
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio and Caulfield v. Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees Retirement Income Plan in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana) alleging improper calculation of lump sum distributions and, in the case of Abelman , claims for failure to satisfy minimum accrual requirements. The relief sought in the three actions includes recalculation of benefits in unspecified amounts, pre- and post-judgment interest, injunctive relief and attorneys fees. None of the actions has been certified as a class action as yet. The Company intends to contest these actions vigorously.
While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of the above noted contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, on-going results of operations or cash flows.
14.Segment Information The Company operates in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. The operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment are managed geographically in four reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa. Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.
71 Table of Contents COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(continued) (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2. Intercompany sales have been eliminated. Corporate operations include restructuring and related implementation costs, stock-based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock awards, research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets, and SFAS 88 charges. The Company reports these items within Corporate operations as they relate to Corporate-based responsibilities and decisions and are not included in the internal measures of segment operating performance used by the Company in order to measure the underlying performance of the business segments. Segment information regarding Net sales, Operating profit, Capital expenditures, Depreciation and amortization and Identifiable assets is detailed below.

Effective January1, 2006, the Company modified the geographic reporting structure of its Oral, Personal and Home Care segment in order to address evolving markets and more closely align countries with similar consumer needs and retail trade structures. Management responsibility for Eastern European operations, including Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and Belarus, was transferred to Greater Asia management, and responsibility for operations in the South Pacific, including Australia, was transferred to European management. The financial information for 2005 has been reclassified to conform to the new reporting structure.
