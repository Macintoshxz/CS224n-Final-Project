Our business, financial condition, results         of         operations and prospects may have changed since that date.
For         a         discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect         our         future events, developments or results, you should carefully review the risk         factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors beginning on page 10, as well as " Managements Discussion and         Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations " beginning on page         17.
Our         forward-looking statements could be wrong in light of these and other risks,         uncertainties and assumptions. The future events, developments or results         described in this report could turn out to be materially different. We have         no         obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements after         the         date of this annual report and you should not expect us to do so.
Investors         should also be aware that while we do, from time to time, communicate with         securities analysts and others, we do not, by policy, selectively disclose         to         them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial         information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that we agree with         any         statement or report issued by any securities analyst regardless of the content         of the statement or report. We generally do not issue financial forecasts         or         projections and we do not, by policy, confirm those issued by others. Thus,         to         the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections,         forecasts or opinions, such reports are not our responsibility.

5 Table         of Contents Index         to Consolidated Financial         Statements PART         I Item         1 . BUSINESS Overview Since         our         founding in 1986, we have become the leading operator of discount variety         stores         offering merchandise at the fixed price of $1.00. We believe the variety         and         quality of products we sell for $1.00 sets us apart from our competitors.         At         January 28, 2006, we operated 2,914 single-price point stores under the names         of         Dollar Tree, Dollar Bills and Dollar Express.
Since         1986, we have evolved from opening primarily mall-based stores ranging between         1,500 and 2,500 selling square feet to opening primarily strip shopping         center-based stores averaging 10,000 to 15,000 selling square feet. In the         past         five years, we have modified our average store size to reflect what we believe         is our optimal store size of between 10,000 and 12,500 square feet. Our current         store size reflects our expanded merchandise offerings and improved service         to         our customers. At December 31, 2001, we operated 1,975 stores in 37 states.         At         January 28, 2006, we operated 2,914 stores in 48 states. Our selling square         footage increased from approximately 10.1 million square feet in December         2001         to 23.0 million square feet in January 2006. Our store growth since 2001         has         resulted from opening new stores and completing mergers and acquisitions.         We         centrally manage our store and distribution operations from our corporate         headquarters in Chesapeake, Virginia.
Business         Strategy Value         Merchandise Offering .         We         strive to exceed our customers' expectations over the variety and quality         of         products that they can purchase for $1.00 by offering items that we believe         typically sell for higher prices elsewhere. We buy approximately 60% of our         merchandise domestically and import the remaining 40%. Our domestic purchases         include closeouts. We believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise         affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed the         customer's expectation. In addition, direct relationships with manufacturers         permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging         and         product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers' needs.
Mix         of Basic Variety and Seasonal Merchandise.
We         maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store         categories. We offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we         supplement these basic, everyday items with seasonal and closeout merchandise.         We attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores         continuously to establish our stores as a destination. Closeout merchandise         is         purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10% of our purchases.         National, regional and private-label brands have become a bigger part of         our         merchandise mix.
Our         merchandise mix consists of:  consumable                   merchandise, which includes candy and food, health and beauty care,                   and                   household consumables such as paper, plastics and household chemicals                   and                   in select stores, frozen and refrigerated food;  variety                   merchandise, which includes toys, durable housewares, gifts, party                   goods,                   greeting cards, hardware, and other items; and  seasonal                   goods include Easter, Halloween and Christmas merchandise, along                   with                   summer toys and lawn and garden                   merchandise.
6 Table           of Contents Index           to Consolidated Financial           Statements Our         larger stores, which appeal to a broader demographic mix, carry more consumable         merchandise than smaller stores. We have also added freezers and coolers         to         approximately 200 stores in 2005 and plan to add them to approximately 250         more         Dollar Tree stores in 2006. As a result of our larger store size and the         installation of freezers and coolers in select stores, consumable merchandise         has grown as a percentage of purchases and sales and we expect this trend         to         continue. The following table shows the percentage of purchases of each major         product group for the years ended January 28, 2006 and January 29,         2005: January                   28, January                   29, Merchandise                   Type 2006 2005 Variety                   categories 47.2% 49.9% Consumable 44.9% 41.4% Seasonal 7.9% 8.7% Customer         Payment Methods.
All         of         our stores accept cash and checks and approximately 700 stores accept MasterCard         and Visa credit cards .
In         2005,         we expanded the tender types that we accept at our stores. Prior to May 2005,         approximately 900 of our stores accepted debit cards. By the end of 2005,         approximately 2,300 of our stores accepted debit cards as a result of the         debit         roll-out. We also began accepting food stamps at certain of our stores in         2005.         We believe that expanding the tender types accepted at our stores helped         increase the average size of transactions in the second half of 2005.
Convenient         Locations and Store Size.
We         primarily focus on opening new stores in strip shopping centers anchored         by mass         merchandisers, whose target customers we believe to be similar to ours, and         in         neighborhood centers anchored by large grocery retailers. Our stores have         proven         successful in metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities and small towns. The range         of         our store sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that         best         suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities.         Our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for         shoppers by using bright lighting, vibrant colors, decorative signs and         background music. We enhance the store design with attractive merchandise         displays. We believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances         our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store.
For         more         information on retail locations and retail store leases, see "Properties." Profitable         Stores with Strong Cash Flow.
We         maintain a disciplined, cost-sensitive approach to store site selection in         order         to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential         to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows. We believe that         our         stores have a relatively small shopping radius, which allows us to profitably         concentrate multiple stores within a single market. Our ability to open new         stores is dependent upon, among other factors, locating suitable sites and         negotiating favorable lease terms.
Our         older, smaller stores continue to generate significant store-level operating         income and operating cash flows and have some of the highest operating margin         rates among our stores; however, the increased size of our newer stores allows         us to offer a wider selection of products, including more basic consumable         merchandise, thereby making them more attractive as a destination         store.
The         strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to self-fund infrastructure         investment and new stores. Over the past five years, cash flows from operating         activities have exceeded capital expenditures.
For         more         information on our results of operations, see " Management's Discussion and Analysis         - Results         of Operations ." For more information on seasonality of sales, see " Management's Discussion and         Analysis -         Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations ." Cost         Control .         We         believe that substantial buying power at the $1.00 price point contributes         to         our successful purchasing strategy, which includes disciplined, targeted         merchandise margin goals by category. We believe our disciplined buying and         quality merchandise help to minimize markdowns. We buy products on an         order-by-order basis and have no material long-term purchase contracts or         other         assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost. No vendor         accounted for more than 10% of total merchandise purchased in any of the         past         five years.
Our         supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information         to         assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores. Controlling         our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store         operations.
7 Table           of Contents Index           to Consolidated Financial           Statements Information         Systems.
We         believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control         costs. Our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency         of our supply chain, improve merchandise flow and control distribution and         store         operating costs.
Our         automatic replenishment system automatically reorders key items, based on         actual         store level sales and inventory. In 2004 and 2005, we rolled out this system         to         additional stores and merchandise categories. At the end of 2005, we had         over         600 basic, everyday items on automatic replenishment. At various times during         the year, we also had approximately 200 more seasonal items on automatic         replenishment during the applicable season. As we continue to utilize this         system, our store management has more time to focus on customer service.
Point-of-sale         data allows us to track sales by merchandise category at the store level         and         assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory. We believe that         this         information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the         quantities commensurate with selling patterns. During the first half of 2004,         we         completed the roll-out of our point-of-sale systems to most of our stores.         Using         this point-of-sale data for planning purchases of inventory has helped us         reduce         our inventory per store approximately         12% and increase inventory turns in the current year.
Corporate         Culture and Values.
We         believe that honesty and integrity, doing the right things for the right         reasons, and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within         our         corporate culture. We believe that running a business, and certainly a public         company, carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making         operational and financial decisions. Our management team visits and shops         our         stores like every customer; we have an open door policy for all our associates;         and ideas and individual creativity are encouraged. We have standards for         store         displays, merchandise presentation, and store operations. Our distribution         centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually         everyone in our store support center is available to assist associates in         the         stores and distribution centers.
Our         disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and identifies and monitors         our         internal controls over financial reporting and ensures that our public filings         contain discussions about the risks our business faces. We believe that we         have         the controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements.         Additionally, we have complied with the updated listing requirements for         the         Nasdaq Stock Market.
Growth         Strategy Store         Openings and Square Footage Growth.
The         primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store         openings, an active store expansion and remodel program, and selective mergers         and acquisitions. From 2001 to 2005, net sales increased at a compound annual         growth rate of 14.3%. We expect that the substantial majority of our future         sales growth will come primarily from new store openings and secondarily         from         our store expansion and relocation program.
The         following table shows the total selling square footage of our stores and         the         selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years. Our         growth         and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage         because         our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate         measure of store productivity. The selling square footage statistics for         2001         through 2005 are estimates based on the relationship of selling to gross         square         footage.
Year Number                   of Stores Average                   Selling Square Footage Per Store Average                   Selling Square Footage Per New Store Opened 2001 1,975 5,130 7,070 2002 2,263 5,763 7,783 2003 2,513 6,716 9,948 2004 2,735 7,475 10,947 2005 2,914 7,900 9,756 We         expect         to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening new stores         in         underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing         markets via new store openings and store expansions (expansions include store         relocations). In fiscal 2006 and beyond, we plan to predominantly open stores         that are approximately 10,000 selling square feet and we believe this size         allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand.         At January 28, 2006, 673 of our stores, totaling 39.1% of our selling square         footage, were 10,000 selling square feet or larger .
8 Table           of Contents Index           to Consolidated Financial           Statements In         addition to new store openings, we plan to continue our store expansion program         to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities.         We target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square         foot and changes in market opportunities. Stores targeted for expansion are         generally less than 6,000 selling square feet in size. Store expansions         generally increase the existing store size by approximately 6,000 selling         square         feet.
Since         1995 through the end of fiscal 2005, we have added a total of 471 stores         through         four mergers and several small acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy has         been         to target companies with a similar single price point concept that have shown         success in operations or provide a strategic advantage. We evaluate potential         acquisition opportunities in our retail sector as they become available.
On         March         26, 2006, we completed our acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores for approximately         $30.5 million of store related assets and $22.2 million of store and         distribution center inventory. These amounts are subject to post-closing         adjustments based on the results of physical inventory counts. These stores         are         primarily in the Midwest part of the United States and we have existing         logistics capacity to service these stores with no additional capital         expenditure. This acquisition also includes a few combo stores that offer an         expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than         $1.         Substantially all Deal$ stores acquired will continue to operate under the         Deal$         banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our Dollar Tree         infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts, including higher         price points without disrupting the single-price point model in our Dollar         Tree         stores.
In         2005,         we also acquired the rights to 35 store leases through bankruptcy proceedings         of         certain discount retailers. We will take advantage of these opportunities         as         they arise in the future.
Merchandising         and Distribution.
Expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans. We plan to         continue to stock our new stores with the ever-changing merchandise that         our         current customers have come to appreciate. In addition, we are opening larger         stores that contain more basic consumable merchandise to attract new customers.         Consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our         stores resulting in increased sales. The presentation and display of merchandise         in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating         a more exciting shopping experience. We believe our approach to visual         merchandising results in high store traffic, high sales volume and an         environment that encourages impulse purchases.
A         strong         and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and         to         maintain a low-cost operating structure. We opened two new distribution centers         in 2004, Ridgefield, Washington and Joliet, Illinois, while replacing our         Chicago distribution center. We currently operate nine distribution centers.         We         believe, these distribution centers in total are capable of supporting         approximately $4.5 billion in annual sales. We expect to continue to add         distribution capacity to support our store opening plans, with the aim of         remaining approximately one year ahead of our distribution needs. Based on         current plans, we will not need to add any distribution capacity until at         least         2007. New distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles,         maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas.
Our         stores receive approximately 95% of their inventory from our distribution         centers via contract carriers. The remaining store inventory, primarily         perishable consumable items and other vendor-maintained display items, are         delivered directly to our stores from vendors. For more information on our         distribution center network, see Properties .
Competition The         retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase         in         the future. Our value discount retail competitors include Family Dollar,         Dollar         General, 99 Cents Only and Big Lots. The principal methods of competition         include closeout merchandise, convenience and the quality of merchandise         offered         to the customer. Though we are a fixed-price point retailer, we also compete         with mass merchandisers, such as Wal-Mart and Target, and regional discount         retailers. In addition, several mass merchandisers and grocery store chains         carry "dollar store" or dollar zone concepts in their stores, which will         increase competition. Our sales and profits could be reduced by increases         in         competition, especially because there are no significant economic barriers         for         others to enter our retail sector.
9 Table           of Contents Index           to Consolidated Financial           Statements Trademarks We         are         the owners of federal service mark registrations for "Dollar Tree," the "Dollar         Tree" logo, "1 Dollar Tree" together with the related design, and "One         Price...One Dollar." A small number of our stores operate under the name         "Only         One Dollar," for which we have not obtained a service mark registration.         We also         own a concurrent use registration for "Dollar Bill$" and the related logo.         During 1997, we acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by         Everything's A Dollar, a former competitor in the $1.00 price point industry.         Several trade names were included in the purchase, including the marks         "Everything's $1.00 We Mean Everything," and "Everything's $1.00," the         registration of which is pending. With the acquisition of Dollar Express,         we         became the owner of the service marks "Dollar Express" and "Dollar         Expres$." We         became         the owners of the "Greenbacks All A Dollar" and "All A Dollar" service marks,         with the acquisition of Greenbacks. We have applied for federal trademark         registrations for various private labels that we use to market some of our         product lines.
Employees We         employed approximately 11,400 full-time and 26,000 part-time associates on         January 28, 2006. The number of part-time associates fluctuates depending         on         seasonal needs. We consider our relationship with our associates to be good,         and         we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor         disagreements. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining         agreements.
Item         1A . RISK FACTORS An         investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should         carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all         other information included or incorporated in this report. Any of the following         risks may materialize, and additional risks not known to us, or that we now         deem         immaterial, may arise. In such event, our business, financial condition,         results         of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that         occurs, the market price of our common stock could fall, and you could lose         all         or part of your investment.
Our         profitability is especially vulnerable to cost         increases.
Future         increase in costs         such as the cost of merchandise, shipping rates, freight costs, fuel costs,         wage         levels and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability. As a fixed         price         retailer, we cannot raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost         increases. Unlike multi-price retailers, we are primarily dependent on our         ability to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net         sales         in order to offset inflation. We expect comparable store net sales will be         about         flat to slightly positive in 2006. We can give you no assurance that we will         be         able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future. Please         see         Item 7 " Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial         Condition and Results of Operations ," of this Form 10-K for further         discussion of the effect of Inflation and Other Economic Factors on our         operations.
Our         profitability is affected by the mix of products we         sell.
Our         gross         profit could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods         we sell         in the future. In recent years, the percentage of our sales from higher cost         consumable products has increased, and is likely to increase in 2006. Our         gross         profit will decrease unless we are able to increase the amount of our net         sales         sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage. We         can         give you no assurance that we will be able to do so.
We         may be unable to expand our square footage as profitably as         planned.
We         plan         to expand our selling square footage by approximately 12% to 14% in 2006         to         increase our sales and profits. Expanding our square footage profitably depends         on a number of uncertainties, including our ability to locate, lease, build         out         and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under         favorable economic terms. We must also open or expand stores within our         established geographic markets, where new or expanded stores may draw sales         away         from our existing stores. We may not manage our expansion effectively, and         our         failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect         our         business, financial condition and results of operations.
10 Table         of Contents Index           to Consolidated Financial           Statements A         downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our sales.
Economic         conditions, such as those caused by recession, inflation, adverse weather         conditions, or terrorism, could reduce consumer spending or cause customers         to         shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as         profitably. For example, we believe customers visited our stores less frequently         last year as a result of increased gasoline prices. Adverse economic conditions         could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales.
Our         sales and profits rely on imported merchandise, which may increase in cost         or         become unavailable.
Merchandise         imported directly from overseas accounts for approximately 40% of our total         purchases at retail. In addition, we believe that a small portion of our         goods         purchased from domestic vendors is imported. China is the source of a         substantial majority of our imports. Imported goods are generally less expensive         than domestic goods and increase our profit margins. A disruption in the         flow of         our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may         significantly decrease our profits. Risks associated with our reliance on         imported goods include:  disruptions                   in the flow of imported goods because of factors such                   as: o raw                   material shortages, work stoppages, strikes and political                   unrest; o problems                   with oceanic shipping, including shipping container                   shortages; o economic                   crises and international disputes  increases                   in the cost of purchasing or shipping foreign merchandise, resulting                   from: o increases                   in shipping rates imposed by the trans-Pacific ocean                   carriers; o changes                   in currency exchange rates and local economic conditions, including                   inflation in the country of origin.
o failure                   of the United States to maintain normal trade relations with China;                   and o import                   duties, import quota and other trade                   sanctions; We         could encounter disruptions or additional costs in receiving and distributing         merchandise.
Our         success depends on our ability to transport merchandise from our suppliers         to         our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and         cost-effective manner. We may not anticipate, respond to or control all of         the         challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems. Some of the         factors that could have an adverse effect on our shipping and receiving systems         or costs are:  Shipping.
Our                   oceanic shipping schedules may be disrupted or delayed from time                   to time.                   We also have experienced shipping rate increase over the last several                   years imposed by the trans-Pacific ocean                   carriers.
Vulnerability                   to natural or man-made disasters.
A                   fire, explosion or natural disaster at any of our distribution                   facilities                   could result in a loss of merchandise and impair our ability to                   adequately                   stock our stores. Some of our facilities are especially vulnerable                   to                   earthquakes, hurricanes and                   tornadoes.
Labor                   disagreement.
Labor disagreements or disruptions may result in delays in the                   delivery of                   merchandise to our stores and increase                   costs.
War,                   terrorism and other events.
War and acts of terrorism in the United States, or in China or                   other parts                   of Asia where we buy a significant amount of our imported merchandise,                   could disrupt our supply chain.
Sales         below our expectations during peak seasons may cause our operating results         to         suffer materially.
Our         highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons. We generally         realize         a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of         our         operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation, we stock         extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to supplement our stores.         An         economic downturn during these periods could adversely affect our operating         results, particularly operating and net income, to a greater extent than         if a         downturn occurred at other times of the year. Untimely merchandise delays         due to         receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect.
11 Table         of Contents Index           to Consolidated Financial           Statements Pressure         from competitors may reduce our sales and profits.
The         retail industry is highly competitive. The marketplace is highly fragmented         as         many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety         of         store formats and merchandising strategies. We expect competition to increase         in         the future because there are no significant economic barriers for others         to         enter our retail sector. Many of our current or potential competitors have         greater financial resources than we do. We cannot guarantee that we will         continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future         competitors. Please see Item 1 Business , of this         Form 10-K for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations.
The         resolution of certain legal matters could have a material adverse effect         on our         results of operations, accrued liabilities and cash.
For         a         discussion of current legal matters, please see Item 3. Legal         Proceedings of this Form 10-K. Resolution of certain matters described in         that item, if decided against the Company, could have a material adverse         effect         on our results of operations, accrued liabilities and cash.
Certain         provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage         a takeover attempt that may be in a shareholder's best         interest Our         articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or         discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best         interest, including takeover attempts that might result in a premium being         paid         for shares of our common stock. These provisions, among other things:  classify                   our board of directors into three classes, each of which serves                   for                   different three-year periods;  provide                   that only the board of directors, chairman or president may call                   special                   meetings of the shareholders;  establish                   certain advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates                   for                   election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered                   at                   shareholders' meetings;  require                   a vote of the holders of more than two-thirds of the shares entitled                   to                   vote in order to remove a director, change the number of directors,                   or                   amend the foregoing and certain other provisions of the articles                   of                   incorporation and bylaws; and  permit                   the board of directors, without further action of the shareholders,                   to                   issue and fix the terms of preferred stock, which may have rights                   senior                   to those of the common stock.

12 Table         of Contents Index           to Consolidated Financial           Statements Item           2 . PROPERTIES Stores As           of           January 28, 2006, we operated 2,914 stores in 48 states as detailed           below: Alabama 77 Maine 13 Ohio 109 Arizona 43 Maryland 69 Oklahoma 41 Arkansas 45 Massachusetts 32 Oregon 62 California 209 Michigan 106 Pennsylvania 175 Colorado 28 Minnesota 35 Rhode                     Island 9 Connecticut 21 Mississippi 47 South                     Carolina 68 Delaware 16 Missouri 54 South                     Dakota 3 Florida 195 Montana 8 Tennessee 77 Georgia 116 Nebraska 10 Texas 193 Idaho 18 Nevada 21 Utah 31 Illinois 109 New                     Hampshire 13 Vermont 6 Indiana 77 New                     Jersey 62 Virginia 124 Iowa 24 New                     Mexico 19 Washington 50 Kansas 24 New                     York 136 West                     Virginia 30 Kentucky 54 North                     Carolina 142 Wisconsin 54 Louisiana 54 North                     Dakota 2 Wyoming 3 We         currently lease our stores and expect to continue to lease new stores as         we         expand. Our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term (generally         five years) with options to extend. We believe this leasing strategy enhances         our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from         changing market conditions.
As         current leases expire, we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals,         if desired, for present store locations, or to obtain leases for equivalent         or         better locations in the same general area. From time to time we may not comply         with certain provisions of our store operating leases. We maintain good         relations with our landlords and believe that violation of these provisions,         if         any, will not have a material effect on our operations.
Distribution         Centers The         following table includes information about the distribution centers that         we         currently operate. We believe our distribution center network is capable         of         supporting approximately $4.5 billion in annual sales.

With         the         exception of our Salt Lake City and Ridgefield facilities, each of our         distribution centers contains advanced materials handling technologies,         including automated conveyor and sorting systems, radio-frequency inventory         tracking equipment and specialized information systems.
For         more         information on financing of our distribution centers, see " Management's Discussion and Analysis - Funding         Requirements ." 13 Table           of Contents Index             to Consolidated Financial             Statements Item         3 . LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From         time         to time, we are defendants in ordinary, routine litigation and proceedings         incidental to our business, including allegations regarding:  employment                   related matters;  infringement                   of intellectual property rights;  product                   safety matters, which may include product recalls in cooperation                   with the                   Consumer Products Safety Commission; and  personal                   injury claims.
In         2003,         we were served with a lawsuit in California state court by a former employee         who         alleged that employees did not properly receive sufficient meal breaks and         paid         rest periods. He also alleged other wage and hourly violations. The suit         requested that the California state court certify the case as a class action.         This suit was dismissed with prejudice in May 2005, and the dismissal has         been         appealed. In May 2005, a new suit alleging similar claims was filed in         California.
In         2005,         we were served with a lawsuit by former employees in Oregon who allege that         they         did not properly receive sufficient meal breaks and paid rest periods. They         also         allege other wage and hour violations. The plaintiffs have requested the         Oregon         state court to certify the case as a class action.
In         2006,         we were served with a lawsuit by former employees in Washington who allege         that         they did not properly receive sufficient meal breaks and paid rest periods.         They         also allege other wage and hour violations. The plaintiffs have requested         the         Washington state court to certify the case as a class action.
We         will         vigorously defend ourselves in these lawsuits. We do not believe that any         of         these matters will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse         effect on our business or financial condition. We cannot give assurance,         however, that one or more of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse         effect on our results of operations for the period in which they are resolved.
We         were         served in another lawsuit that alleged various intellectual property violations.         We settled the lawsuit in May 2005. The terms of the settlement are confidential         and we are indemnified by a supplier. The settlement was not significant         to the         financial statements.
Item         4 . SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY         HOLDERS No         matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter         of our 2005 fiscal year.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED         STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY         SECURITIES Our         common stock has been traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol "DLTR"         since our initial public offering on March 6, 1995. The following table gives         the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported by Nasdaq for         the         periods indicated.
High Low Fiscal                     year ended January 29, 2005: First                     Quarter $ 33.97 $ 26.82 Second                     Quarter 29.20 24.50 Third                     Quarter 29.28 22.29 Fourth                     Quarter 30.29 26.40 Fiscal                     year ended January 28, 2006: First                     Quarter $ 29.04 $ 23.95 Second                     Quarter 26.01 22.77 Third                     Quarter 25.65 20.56 Fourth                     Quarter 25.48 20.66 On         April         7, 2006, the last reported sale price for our common stock, as quoted by         Nasdaq,         was $ 27.67 per         share. As of April 7, 2006, we had approximately 580 shareholders of record.
We         had no         stock repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2005.
In         March         2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million         of our common stock during the next three years and concurrently terminated         the         previous November 2002, $200.0 million authorization. For 2005 and 2004,         we         repurchased 7,024,450 shares and 1,809,953 shares, respectively, for         approximately $180.4 million and $48.6 million, respectively. As of January         28,         2006, we had approximately $174.9 million remaining under the March 2005         authorization. From January 29, 2006 through March 31, 2006, we have repurchased         additional shares totaling $22.6 million under this authorization.
We         anticipate that substantially all of our cash flow from operations in the         foreseeable future will be retained for the development and expansion of         our         business, the repayment of indebtedness and, as authorized by our Board of         Directors, the repurchase of stock. Management does not anticipate paying         dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our         credit         facilities contain financial covenants that restrict our ability to pay cash         dividends.
Item         6 . SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The         following table presents a summary of our selected financial data for the         fiscal         years ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005, and January 31, 2004 and         the         calendar years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. In January 2003, we changed         our         fiscal year end to a retail fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to         January 31. The selected income statement and balance sheet data have been         derived from our consolidated financial statements that have been audited         by our         independent registered public accounting firm. This information should be         read         in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes,         "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of         Operations" and our financial information found elsewhere in this report.
Comparable         store net sales compare net sales for stores open throughout each of the         two         periods being compared, including expanded stores. Net sales per store and         net         sales per selling square foot are calculated for stores open throughout the         period presented.
Amounts         in the following tables are in thousands, except per share data, number of         stores data, and net sales per selling square foot data.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In         Managements Discussion and Analysis, we explain the general financial condition         and the results of operations for our company, including:  what                   factors affect our business;  what                   our earnings, gross margins and costs were in 2005 and                   2004;  why                   those earnings, gross margins and costs were different from the                   year                   before;  how                   all of this affects our overall financial condition;  what                   our expenditures for capital projects were in 2005 and what we                   expect them                   to be in 2006; and  where                   funds will come from to pay for future                   expenditures.
As         you         read Managements Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our consolidated         financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K,         which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended January         28,         2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004. In Managements Discussion and         Analysis, we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line         items         in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2005 compared         to         the comparable fiscal year 2004 and the fiscal year 2004 compared to the         comparable fiscal year 2003.
Key         Events and Recent Developments Several         key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our results         of operations. You should keep in mind that:  In                   March 2006, we completed our acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores and                   related                   assets. We paid approximately $30.5 million for store related assets                   and                   $22.2 million for store and distribution center inventory. These                   amounts                   are subject to post-closing adjustments based on the results of                   physical                   inventory counts.
On                   December 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors                   approved the acceleration of the vesting date of all previously                   issued,                   outstanding and unvested options under all current stock option                   plans,                   effective as of December 15, 2005. This decision eliminated non-cash                   compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods                   following our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards                   No.                   123, Share-Based                   Payment (revised 2004) (FAS                   123R), on January 29, 2006. Future compensation expense has been                   reduced                   by approximately $14.9 million over a period of four years during                   which                   the options would have vested, as a result of the option acceleration                   program.
In                   March 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of                   up to $300                   million of our common stock during the next three years. This                   authorization superseded the previous repurchase program authorized                   by the                   Board in November 2002. As of January 28, 2006, we had $174.9 million                   remaining under this authorization.
In                   2004, we completed construction and began operations in two new                   distribution centers. In June 2004, we began operations in our                   new                   distribution center in Joliet, Illinois. The Joliet distribution                   center is                   a 1.2 million square foot, fully automated facility that replaced                   our                   Chicago distribution center. In February 2004, we began operations                   in our                   Ridgefield, Washington distribution center. The Ridgefield distribution                   center is a 665,000 square foot facility that can be expanded to                   accommodate future growth needs. With the completion of these two                   distribution centers, we now have nine distribution centers that                   will                   support approximately $4.5 billion in sales annually. We do not                   plan to                   expand our distribution center capacity until at least fiscal                   2007.
In                   March 2004, we entered into a five-year $450.0 million Unsecured                   Revolving                   Credit Facility (Facility). We used availability under this Facility                   to                   repay the $142.6 million of variable rate debt. This Facility also                   replaced our previous $150.0 million revolving credit                   facility.
In                   June 2003, we completed our acquisition of Greenbacks, Inc., based                   in Salt                   Lake City, Utah. Greenbacks operated 100 stores in 10 western states                   and                   an expandable 252,000 square foot distribution center in Salt Lake                   City.                   We accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of                   accounting                   and as a result, Greenbacks is included in our results since the                   date of                   acquisition, which was June 29,                   2003.
17 Table           of Contents Index             to Consolidated Financial             Statements Overview Our         net         sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to         affect         our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores or adding         new         stores through acquisitions. Second, sales vary at our existing stores from         one         year to the next. We refer to this change as a change in comparable store         net         sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both         of the         periods being compared. We include sales from stores expanded during the         year in         the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of         increasing our comparable store net sales. The term 'expanded' also includes         stores that are relocated.
In         fiscal         2005, we increased our selling square footage by approximately 13%. Of the         2.6         million selling square foot increase in 2005, approximately 0.5 million was         added by expanding existing stores. The increase in selling square footage         fell         slightly below our planned square footage growth of 14%-16% as we closed         more         stores than planned in fiscal 2005 and our average new store size was slightly         below target. The average size of our stores opened in 2005 was approximately         10,000 selling square feet (or about 12,400 gross square feet). In 2006,         we         expect to open stores slightly smaller than in 2005. These stores generate         higher sales and operating income per store than our smaller stores and we         believe that they create an improved shopping environment that invites customers         to shop longer and buy more.
For         fiscal 2005, we experienced a decrease in comparable store net sales of 0.8%.         This had a negative effect on sales as we had planned to have comparable         store         net sales to be flat or slightly positive for 2005. Our comparable store         net         sales results were positively affected by the addition of 0.5 million selling         square feet due to expanded and relocated stores during the year. The decrease         in comparable store net sales was the result of a decline of 2.6% in the         number         of transactions, partially offset by an increase of 1.9% in transaction size.         We         believe comparable store net sales were primarily affected by the impact         of         higher fuel costs, which leave our customers with less disposable income,         causing them to make fewer shopping trips and the shift in the timing of         Easter         from April 11 in 2004 to March 27 in 2005. Most retailers have the ability         to         increase their merchandise prices or alter the mix of their merchandise to         favor         higher-priced items in order to increase their comparable store net sales.         As a         fixed-price point retailer, we do not have the ability to raise our prices.         Generally, our comparable store net sales will increase only if we sell more         units per transaction or experience an increase in the number of transactions.
In         2005,         we put initiatives in place that we believe are helping to offset some of         the         effect that higher fuel costs are having on our sales, including increased         advertising of featured products and continued expansion of forms of payment         accepted by our stores. Currently, over 2,300 of our stores accept debit         cards,         including over 1,400 stores which began accepting debit cards beginning with         the         roll-out in May 2005. We began to see positive effects from these initiatives         in         the second half of 2005 and believe that they will help increase comparable         store net sales, despite continued high fuel costs.
We         experienced a slight shift in the mix of merchandise sold to more consumables,         which have lower margin, in 2005. We believe that higher fuel costs in 2005,         which left our customers with less disposable income, contributed to the         shift         to more consumables as our customers bought more consumable and everyday         items         as opposed to our other merchandise categories. The shift in mix to more         consumables is also the result of the roll-out of freezers and coolers to         approximately 200 stores in 2005. As we continue to roll-out freezers and         coolers to approximately 250 more stores in 2006, we expect to continue to         see         the pressure on margins in 2006. However, we believe that this will enable         us to         increase sales and earnings in the future by increasing the number of shopping         trips made by our customers.
We         expect         the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from square         footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing         stores. We expect the average size of new stores opened in fiscal 2006 to         be         approximately 9,200 selling square feet per store (or about 11,400 gross         square         feet). We believe this size allows us to achieve our objectives in the markets         in which we plan to expand. Larger stores take longer to negotiate, build         out         and open and generally have lower net sales per square foot than our smaller         stores. While our newer, larger stores have lower sales per square foot than         older, smaller stores, they generate higher sales and operating income dollars         per store and create an improved shopping environment that invites customers         to         shop longer and buy more.
We         must         control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and         administrative expenses. Increases in these expenses could negatively impact         our         operating results because we cannot pass on increased expenses to our customers         by increasing our merchandise-selling price above the $1.00 price point in         our         Dollar Tree stores.
18 During         the first half of fiscal 2004, we completed the rollout of our point-of-sale         systems to most of our stores. Our point-of-sale technology provides us with         valuable sales information to assist our buyers and to improve merchandise         allocation to the stores. We believe that it has enabled us to better control         our inventory, which has resulted in more efficient distribution and store         operations. Using the data from this system to better plan our inventory         purchases has helped us reduce inventory per store by almost 12% as of January         28, 2006 and increase inventory turnover in the current year.
Our         plans         for fiscal 2006 anticipate comparable store net sales increases of about         flat to         slightly positive yielding net sales in the $3.845 to $3.940 billion range         and         diluted earnings per share of $1.68 to $1.80. We also expect a shift in the         seasonality of our earnings in 2006. Easter is 20 days later in the current         year, positively impacting the first quarter of 2006, and there is an extra         shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will impact the fourth         quarter as compared to the prior year. Also, the retail calendar provides         us         with one extra week of sales in fiscal 2006. This guidance for 2006 is based         on         12%-14% selling square footage growth, which includes the acquisition of         138         Deal$ stores, or about 5% of the overall increase (See Deal$ discussion below).
On         March         26, 2006, we completed our acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores for approximately         $30.5 million of store related assets and $22.2 million of store and         distribution center related inventory. These amounts are subject to post-closing         adjustments based on the results of physical inventory counts. These stores         are         primarily in the Midwest part of the United States and we have existing         logistics capacity to service these stores with no additional capital         expenditure required. This acquisition also includes a few combo stores that         offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for         more         than $1. Substantially all Deal$ stores acquired will continue to operate         under         the Deal$ banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our Dollar         Tree         infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts, including higher         price points without disrupting the single-price point model in our Dollar         Tree         stores.
In         the fourth quarter of 2004, we recognized a         one-time non-cash, after-tax adjustment of approximately $5.7 million, or         $0.05         per diluted share, to reflect the cumulative impact of a correction of our         accounting practices related to leased properties. Of the aforementioned         amount,         approximately $1.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, related to 2004.         This         adjustment was made in light of the views of the Office of the Chief Accountant         of the Securities and Exchange Commission, expressed in a letter of February         7,         2005, to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding         the         application of generally accepted accounting principles to operating lease         accounting matters. Consistent with the then current industry practices,         we had         reported straight-line expenses for leases beginning on the earlier of the         store         opening date or the commencement date of the lease in prior periods. This         had         the effect of excluding the pre-opening or build-out period of our stores         (generally 60 days) from the calculation of the period over which we expense         rent. In addition, amounts received as tenant allowances or rent abatements         were         reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction to store leasehold improvement         costs instead of being classified as deferred lease credits. The adjustment         made         to correct these practices does not affect historical or future net cash         flows         or the timing of payments under related leases. Rather, this change affected         the         classification of costs on the consolidated statement of operations and cash         flows by increasing depreciation and decreasing rent expense, which is included         as cost of sales. In addition, fixed assets and deferred liabilities increased         due to the net cumulative unamortized allowances and abatements. These new         lease         accounting practices had an approximate $0.02 per diluted share negative         effect         on 2005 earnings.
19 Table           of Contents Index             to Consolidated Financial             Statements Results           of Operations The           following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations,           as a percentage of net sales: Year                     Ended Year                     Ended Year                     Ended January                     28, January                     29, January                     31, 2006 2005 2004 Net                     sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost                     of sales 65.5 % 64.4 % 63.6 % Gross                     profit 34.5 % 35.6 % 36.4 % Selling,                     general and administrative expenses 26.2 % 26.2 % 25.9 % Operating                     income 8.3 % 9.4 % 10.5 % Interest                     income 0.2 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Interest                     expense (0.4 %) (0.3 %) (0.3 %) Income                     before income taxes 8.1 % 9.2 % 10.3 % Provision                     for income taxes (3.0 %) (3.4 %) (4.0 %) Net                     income 5.1 % 5.8 % 6.3 % Fiscal         year ended January 28, 2006 compared to fiscal year ended January 29,         2005 Net         Sales .         Net         sales increased 8.6% in 2005 compared to 2004. We attribute this $267.9 million         increase in net sales primarily to new stores in 2005 and 2004 (which are         not         included in our comparable store net sales calculation) partially offset         by a         slight decrease in comparable store net sales of 0.8% in 2005. Our comparable         store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores,         which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively         affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores. Our         stores larger than 10,000 gross square feet continue to produce our best         comparable store net sales results.
The         following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count         for         fiscal years ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005.
January                   28, 2006 January                   29, 2005 New                   stores 197 209 Acquired                   leases 35 42 Expanded                   or relocated stores 93 129 Closed                   stores (53 ) (29 ) Of         the         2.6 million selling square foot increase in 2005, approximately 0.5 million         in         selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores.
Gross         Profit .         Gross         profit margin decreased to 34.5% in 2005 compared to 35.6% in 2004. The decrease         is primarily due to the following:  Merchandise                   cost, including inbound freight, increased approximately 55 basis                   points,                   due to a slight shift in mix to more consumables, which have a                   lower                   margin and increased inbound freight costs due to higher fuel costs.
Occupancy                   costs increased approximately 45 basis points due primarily to                   deleveraging associated with the negative comparable store net                   sales for                   the year.
20 Table           of Contents Index             to Consolidated Financial             Statements Selling,         General and Administrative Expenses .         Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales,         were         26.2% for 2005 and 2004. However, several components had increases or decreases         as noted below:  Operating                   and corporate expenses decreased approximately 25 basis points                   primarily                   due to decreased store supplies expense as a result of better pricing,                   decreased professional fees and the receipt of insurance proceeds                   resulting from a fire at one of our locations, partially offset                   by                   increased interchange fees resulting from the rollout of our debit                   card                   program in 2005.
Payroll                   related costs decreased approximately 10 basis points due to a                   reduction                   in incentive compensation accruals that are based on 2005 earnings                   and                   lower workers compensation and health care claims in the current                   year.
These                   decreases were partially offset by an approximate 25 basis point                   increase                   in store operating costs primarily due to higher utility costs                   due to                   higher rates and consumption in the current year.
Depreciation                   expense for stores also increased 10 basis points primarily due                   to the                   deleveraging associated with negative comparable store net sales                   for the                   current year.
Operating         Income .         Due to         the reasons discussed above, operating income margin decreased to 8.3% in         2005         compared to 9.4% for 2004.
Interest         Income.
Interest         income increased $2.2 million in 2005 compared to 2004 because of higher         investment balances in the current year and increased interest         rates.
Interest         Expense.
Interest         expense increased $4.8 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. This increase         is         primarily due to increased rates on our revolver in the current year.
Income         Taxes .         Our         effective tax rate was 36.8% in 2005 compared to 37.5% in 2004. The decreased         tax rate for 2005 was due primarily to the resolution of tax uncertainties         in         the current year and increased tax-exempt interest on certain of our         investments.
Fiscal         year ended January 29, 2005 compared to fiscal year ended January 31,         2004 Net         Sales .         Net         sales increased 11.6% in 2004 compared to 2003. We attribute this $326.1         million         increase in net sales primarily to new stores in 2004 and 2003 which are         not         included in our comparable store net sales calculation and to a slight increase         in comparable store net sales of 0.5% in 2004. Our comparable store net sales         are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include         in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when         we         open new stores or expand stores near existing stores. If not for the positive         effect of relocated stores, our comparable store net sales results would         have         been negative in 2004.
The         following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count         for         fiscal years ended January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004.
January                   29, 2005 January                   31, 2004 New                   stores 209 183 Acquired                   stores - 100 Acquired                   leases 42 - Expanded                   or relocated stores 129 124 Closed                   stores (29 ) (42 ) Of         the         3.6 million selling square foot increase in 2004, approximately 0.9 million         in         selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores.
21 Table           of Contents Index             to Consolidated Financial             Statements Gross         Profit .         Gross         profit margin decreased to 35.6% in 2004 compared to 36.4% in 2003. The decrease         is primarily due to the following:  Merchandise                   cost, including inbound freight, increased approximately 20 basis                   points,                   primarily due to increases in inbound freight costs. Inbound freight                   costs                   increased due to higher fuel costs and higher import                   rates.
Markdown                   expense increased approximately 15 basis points due primarily to                   hurricane                   related markdowns in the third quarter of 2004. Also, markdowns                   taken on                   lower than planned seasonal sell through of Christmas merchandise                   and a                   longer post Christmas holiday sale than in 2003 resulted in higher                   promotional markdowns.
Occupancy                   costs increased approximately 65 basis points due to deleveraging                   associated with the low comparable store net sales increase and                   the                   increase in rent expense in 2004 due to lease accounting changes                   noted in                   the Overview.
Partially                   offsetting these increases was an approximate 20 basis point decrease                   in                   shrink expense due to the overall improvement in the shrink rate                   in                   2004.
Selling,         General and Administrative Expenses .         Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales,         increased to 26.2% in 2004 compared to 25.9% in 2003. The increase is primarily         due to the following:  Depreciation                   expense increased approximately 30 basis points as a result of                   our larger                   new and expanded stores and the continued installation of our                   point-of-sales systems and other technology assets.
Advertising                   costs increased approximately 15 basis points due to increased                   electronic                   media and print advertising in certain markets in 2004.
Insurance                   and benefits expense increased approximately 10 basis points due                   to                   increased health care and workers compensation expenses in 2004.
Partially                   offsetting these rate increases was an approximate 15 basis point                   decrease                   in store payroll costs in 2004 due to continued improvements in                   store-level labor productivity.
Operating         Income .         Due to         the reasons discussed above, operating income margin decreased to 9.4% in         2004         compared to 10.5% for 2003.
Interest         Expense.
Interest         expense increased $1.9 million in 2004 as compared to 2003. This increase         is due         to increased debt in the current year and $0.7 million of deferred financing         costs that were charged to interest expense as a result of the refinancing         of         the $150.0 million credit facility and the repayment of the $142.6 million         of         variable rate debt in March 2004.
Income         Taxes .         Our         effective tax rate was 37.5% in 2004 compared to 38.5% in 2003. The decreased         tax rate for 2004 was due primarily to a tax benefit of $2.3 million, or         80         basis points, related to the resolution of a tax uncertainty and approximately         $0.6 million, or 20 basis points, related to tax exempt interest on our         investments.
Liquidity         and Capital Resources Our         business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution         network and operate existing stores. Our working capital requirements for         existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in September and         October. Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital         requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and         distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and         borrowings under our credit facilities.
The         following table compares cash-related information for the years ended January         28, 2006, January 29, 2005, and January 31, 2004: Year                     Ended Year                     Ended Year                     Ended January                     28, January                     29, January                     31, (in                     millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net                     cash provided by (used in): Operating                     activities $ 365.1 $ 276.5 $ 243.7 Investing                     activities (235.5 ) (315.4 ) (282.4 ) Financing                     activities (170.3 ) 61.3 (35.5 ) 22 Table           of Contents Index             to Consolidated Financial             Statements The         $88.6         million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was primarily         due to an approximate 12% decrease in inventory per store at January 28,         2006         compared to January 29, 2005. The inventory per store decrease is the result         of         an initiative to lower backroom inventory levels and increase inventory turns         through a reduction in current year purchases. The aforementioned net cash         provided was partially offset by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities chiefly         as a result of the elimination of bonus depreciation.
The         $79.9         million decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2005 compared to         2004         was the result of a $34.2 million decrease in net purchases of investments         resulting from more cash used to repurchase stock in the current year. The         net         purchases of investments in the current year include $29.9 million of         investments that are in a restricted account to collateralize certain long-term         insurance obligations. These investments replaced higher cost stand-by letters         of credit and surety bonds.
Capital         expenditures also decreased $42.5 million in the current year after two         distribution center projects and point-of-sale installations were completed         in         2004.
The         $231.6 million change in cash used in financing activities in 2005 compared         to         2004 primarily resulted from $180.4 million in stock repurchases in the current         year compared to $48.6 million in the prior year. Also in the prior year,         we         entered into a five-year $450.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, under         which         we received proceeds of $250.0 million. We used a portion of these proceeds         to         repay $142.6 million of variable rate debt for our distribution centers and         invested the balance in short-term tax exempt municipal bonds. As of January         28,         2006, we had $250.0 million outstanding and $200.0 million available under         this         facility. This facility bears interest at LIBOR, plus 0.475% spread.
The         $32.8         million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was primarily         due to increased profitability before non-cash depreciation and amortization         expense. Increased non-cash depreciation expense was primarily attributed         to our         square footage growth in 2004, two new distribution centers in 2004 and our         continued installation of our point-of-sale systems and other technology         assets.
Cash         used         in investing activities is generally expended to open new stores and to expand         or relocate existing stores. The $33.0 million increase in 2004 compared         to 2003         was primarily due to the following:  increased                   investment of cash from borrowings under our Facility in                   2004;  this                   increase was partially offset by the acquisition of Greenbacks                   for                   approximately $100.5 million in 2003; and  decreased                   capital expenditures due to higher expenditures in 2003 on our                   distribution center projects that were completed in the first half                   of                   2004 The         $96.8         million change in cash provided by financing activities in 2004 compared         to 2003         was primarily the result of the following:  increased                   borrowings under our Facility, net of the repayment of our variable                   rate                   debt for our distribution centers;  partially                   offsetting this increase in cash is a $10.6 million increase in                   stock                   repurchases in 2004 under a $200.0 million authorization granted                   by our                   Board of Directors in November 2002 and a $7.1 million decrease                   in cash                   proceeds from stock issued under stock-based compensation                   plans At         January 28, 2006, our long-term borrowings were $269.0 million and our capital         lease commitments were $0.9 million. We also have a $125.0 million and a         $50.0         million Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreement, under which         approximately $81.6 million were committed to letters of credit issued for         routine purchases of imported merchandise at January 28, 2006.
In         March         2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million         of our common stock during the next three years. This authorization terminated         the previous November 2002, $200.0 million authorization. For 2005 and 2004,         we         repurchased 7,024,450 shares and 1,809,953 shares, respectively, for         approximately $180.4 million and $48.6 million, respectively. As of January         28,         2006, we have approximately $174.9 million remaining under the March 2005         authorization. From January 29, 2006 through March 31, 2006, we have repurchased         additional shares totaling $22.6 million under this authorization.
23 Table           of Contents Index             to Consolidated Financial             Statements Funding         Requirements Overview In         2005,         the average investment per new store, including capital expenditures, initial         inventory and pre-opening costs, was approximately $508,000. We expect our         cash         needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2006         to         total approximately $136.0 million,         which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening costs.         Our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 are between $145.0 and         $155.0         million, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded Dollar Tree         stores, improvements to the acquired Deal$ stores and investments in technology.         We believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and         planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided         by         operations and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.
The         following tables summarize our material contractual obligations, including         both         on- and off-balance sheet arrangements, and our commitments (in         millions): Contractual                   Obligations Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Lease                   Financing Operating                   lease obligations $ 1,015.1 $ 243.2 $ 212.9 $ 174.5 $ 138.5 $ 96.2 $ 149.8 Capital                   lease obligations 1.1 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.1 -- Long-term                   Borrowings Revolving                   credit facility 250.0 -- -- -- 250.0 -- -- Revenue                   bond financing 19.0 19.0 -- -- -- -- -- Total                   obligations $ 1,285.2 $ 262.6 $ 213.2 $ 174.7 $ 388.6 $ 96.3 $ 149.8 Commitments Total Expiring                     in 2006 Expiring                     in 2007 Expiring                     in 2008 Expiring                     in 2009 Expiring                     in 2010 Thereafter Letters                     of credit and surety bonds $ 124.7 $ 122.7 $ 2.0 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- Freight                     contracts 47.2 31.8 13.5 1.9 -- -- -- Technology                     assets 6.5 6.5 -- -- -- -- -- Total                     commitments $ 178.4 $ 161.0 $ 15.5 $ 1.9 $ -- $ -- $ -- Lease         Financing Operating         Lease Obligations.
Our         operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable         store         leases. The commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior         to         January 28, 2006 for stores that were not yet open on January 28,         2006.
Capital         Lease Obligations .         Our         capital lease obligations are primarily for payments for distribution center         equipment and computer equipment at the store support center.
Long-Term         Borrowings Revolving         Credit Facility.
In         March         2004, we entered into a five-year Revolving Credit Facility (the Facility).         The         Facility provides for a $450.0 million line of credit, including up to $50.0         million in available letters of credit, bearing interest at LIBOR, plus 0.475%.         The Facility, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified         financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits         the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. We used availability under this         Facility to repay the $142.6 million of variable-rate debt and to purchase         short-term investments. As of January 28, 2006, we had $250.0 million         outstanding on this Facility.
Revenue         Bond Financing .         In May         1998, we entered into an agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance         Corporation under which it issued $19.0 million of variable-rate demand revenue         bonds. We used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition,         construction and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment         for         our distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. At January 28, 2006,         the         balance outstanding on the bonds was $19.0 million. These bonds are due to         be         repaid in June 2018. The bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as         the         interest rate remains variable. The bonds contain a demand provision and,         therefore, outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities. We         pay         interest monthly based on a variable interest rate, which was 4.6% at January         28, 2006.
24 Table           of Contents Index             to Consolidated Financial             Statements Commitments Letters         of Credit and Surety Bonds .         In         March 2001, we entered into a Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security         Agreement, which provides $125.0 million for letters of credit. In December         2004, we entered into an additional Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security         Agreement, which provides $50.0 million for letters of credit. Both of these         letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported         merchandise. Approximately $81.6 million was committed to letters of credit         at         January 28, 2006. We also have letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding         for         our insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of         our         stores.
Freight         Contracts.
We have         contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts         expiring through April 2008. The total amount of these commitments is         approximately $47.2 million.
Technology         Assets.
We have         commitments totaling approximately $6.5 million to primarily purchase store         technology assets for our stores during 2006.
Derivative         Financial Instruments We         are         party to two interest rate swaps, which allow us to manage the risk associated         with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds and a portion         of our         revolving credit facility. The swaps are based on notional amounts of $19.0         million and $25.0 million. Under the $19.0 million agreement, as amended,         we pay         interest to the bank that provided the swap at a fixed rate. In exchange,         the         financial institution pays us at a variable-interest rate, which is similar         to         the rate on the demand revenue bonds. The variable-interest rate on the interest         rate swap is set monthly. No payments are made by either party under the         swap         for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a         predetermined rate (the knock-out rate). The swap may be canceled by the         bank or         us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates         and         expires in 2009.
The         $25.0         million interest rate swap agreement is used to manage the risk associated         with         interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our revolving credit facility.         Under         this agreement, we pay interest to a financial institution at a fixed rate         of         5.43%. In exchange, the financial institution pays us at a variable-interest         rate, which approximates the floating rate on the debt, excluding the credit         spread. The interest rate on the swap is subject to adjustment monthly. The         swap         is effective through March 2006, but it may be canceled by the bank or us         and         settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market         rates.
Because         of the knock-out provision in the $19.0 million swap, changes in the fair         value         of that swap are recorded in earnings. Changes in fair value on our $25.0         million interest rate swap are recorded as a component of "accumulated other         comprehensive income" in the consolidated balance sheets because the swap         qualifies for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with Statement of         Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, as amended by Statement of Financial         Accounting Standards No. 138. The amounts recorded in accumulated other         comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same         period in which the related interest affects earnings.

Critical         Accounting Policies The         preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. Certain         of         our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to         have a         material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary         significantly from         those estimates. Following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider         critical.
Inventory         Valuation As         discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated         Financial Statements, inventories at the distribution centers are stated         at the         lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted-average basis.         Cost         is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a         weighted-average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation         of         inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying         a         calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. The retail         inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the         retail         industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when         markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on         a         timely basis.
Inventory         valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and         judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink,         which         significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the         resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory         method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain         circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper         period.
25 Table           of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial             Statements We estimate our markdown reserve based on the         consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities         of slow moving or carryover seasonal merchandise on hand, historical markdown         statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates         can be         affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including         changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically,         we have         not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns         compared with actual results.
Our         accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our         most         recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic         conditions. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory         counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Our physical inventory         counts are generally taken between January and August of each year; therefore,         the shrink accrual recorded at January 28, 2006 is based on estimated shrink         for         most of 2005, including the fourth quarter. We have not experienced significant         fluctuations in historical shrink rates in our Dollar Tree stores for the         last         two years. However, we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink         in         acquired stores in the year following an acquisition. We periodically adjust         our         shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent.
Our         management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results         in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in         carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market on a year-to-year and         consistent basis.
Accrued         Expenses On         a         monthly basis, we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those         expenses in the period incurred. Our most material estimates include domestic         freight expenses, self-insurance programs, store-level operating expenses,         such         as property taxes and utilities, and certain other expenses. Our freight         and         store-level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and         historical results. Our workers' compensation and general liability insurance         accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted annually         based on a review performed by a third-party actuary. These actuarial valuations         are estimates based on historical loss development factors. Certain other         expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes         aware         of them. The related accruals are adjusted as managements estimates change.         Differences in management's estimates and assumptions could result in an         accrual         materially different from the calculated accrual. Our experience has been         that         some of our estimates are too high and others are too low. Historically,         the net         total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial         condition or results of operations.
Income         Taxes On         a         quarterly basis, we estimate our required income tax liability and assess         the         recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our income taxes payable are         estimated based on enacted tax rates, including estimated tax rates in states         where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed         currently. The current tax liability includes a liability for resolution         of tax         uncertainties. Management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets         based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and         managements projections for future taxable income. We cannot guarantee that we         will generate taxable income in future years. Historically, we have not         experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual.         However, in 2005 and 2004, we recognized approximately $1.5 million and $2.1         million, respectively, of tax benefits related to the resolution of tax         uncertainties.
26 Table         of Contents Index           to Consolidated Financial           Statements Seasonality         and Quarterly         Fluctuations We         experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales,         operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue. Our results         of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of         factors, including:  shifts                   in the timing of certain holidays, especially Easter;  the                   timing of new store openings;  the                   net sales contributed by new stores;  changes                   in our merchandise mix; and  competition.
Our         highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons. Easter was observed         on April 11, 2004, March 27, 2005 and will be observed on April 16, 2006.         Due to         the 20-day longer Easter selling season in 2006, we expect a larger portion         of         our annual earnings to be realized in the first quarter of 2006 as compared         to         2005. We generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and         a         substantial majority of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter.         In anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase         substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary         employees to supplement our continuing store staff. Our operating results,         particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were         below         seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the Easter season for         any         reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution         problems or consumer sentiment.
Our         unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in         a         table in Footnote 13 of the Consolidated Financial         Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Inflation and Other Economic         Factors Our         ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable         basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control.         Consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures, including         rising         fuel prices. Reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an         adverse effect on our sales. National or international events, including         war or         terrorism, could lead to disruptions in economies in the United States or         in         foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise. These and other         factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical         to our operations, such as shipping and wage rates.
Shipping         Costs .         In the         past, we have experienced annual increases of as much as 33% in our         trans-Pacific shipping rates due primarily to rate increases imposed by the         trans-Pacific ocean carriers. Currently, trans-Pacific shipping rates are         negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based         on         supply and demand for containers and current fuel costs. We imported 18,838         forty-foot equivalent containers in 2005 and expect this number to increase         in         fiscal 2006 proportionately to sales growth. As a result, our trans-Pacific         shipping costs in fiscal 2006 may increase compared with fiscal 2005 when         we         renegotiate our import shipping rates effective May 2006. We can give no         assurances as to the amount of the increase, as we are in the early stages         of         our negotiations.
Because         of the increase in fuel costs throughout 2005 and the threat of continued         increases in 2006, we expect increased fuel surcharges from our domestic         contract carriers compared with past years. Based on current fuel prices,         we         estimate that the costs resulting from increased fuel surcharges may approximate         $2.0 to $3.0 million in 2006. We expect to offset a portion of this potential         increase with improved operational efficiencies.
Minimum         Wage.
Although         our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher than the federal minimum         wage, an increase in the mandated minimum wage could significantly increase         our         payroll costs. In prior years, proposals increasing the federal minimum wage         by         $1.00 per hour have narrowly failed to pass both houses of Congress. However,         if         the federal minimum wage were to increase by $1.00 per hour, we believe that         our         annual payroll expenses would increase by approximately 40 basis points,         unless         we realize offsetting cost reductions.
27 Table           of Contents Index             to Consolidated Financial             Statements New         Accounting Pronouncements Effective         January 29, 2006 (the first day of fiscal 2006), the Company adopted FAS         123R.         This statement is a revision of FAS 123, Accounting         for Stock-Based Compensation ,         and         supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. FAS 123R requires         all         share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options,         to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values.         The         Company adopted FAS 123R using the modified prospective method, which requires         expensing of all share-based payments granted on or after January 29, 2006         and         for all awards granted to employees that were unvested as of January 29,         2006.
On         December 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of         the         Company approved the acceleration of the vesting date of all previously issued,         outstanding and unvested options under all current stock option plans, including         the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2004         Executive Officer Equity Plan, effective as of December 15, 2005. At the         effective date, almost all of these options had exercise prices higher than         the         actual stock price. The Company made the decision to accelerate vesting of         these         options to give employees increased performance incentives and to enhance         current retention. This decision also eliminated non-cash compensation expense         that would have been recorded in future periods following the Companys adoption         of FAS 123R on January 29, 2006. Future compensation expense has been reduced         by         $14.9 million, over a period of four years during which the options would         have         vested, as a result of the option acceleration program. This amount is net         of         compensation expense of $150,000 recognized in fiscal 2005 for estimated         forfeiture of certain (in the money) options.
In         March         2006, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted approximately         317,500 options. The grant date for these options is March 31, 2006. The         fair         value of these options of approximately $3.5 million will be recognized over         the         three-year vesting period.
Item         7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET         RISK We         are         exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business,         including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate         fluctuations. We may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to         interest rate changes, and we may employ other risk management strategies,         including the use of foreign currency forward contracts. We do not enter         into         derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes         and         we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes.
Interest         Rate Risk We         use         variable-rate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital         improvements. These obligations expose us to variability in interest payments         due to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest expense         increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense also         decreases. We believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our interest         payments.
To         meet         this objective, we entered into derivative instruments in the form of interest         rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in         the         variable-interest rates on the obligations. The interest rate swaps reduce         the         interest rate exposure on these variable-rate obligations. Under the interest         rate swap, we pay the bank at a fixed-rate and receive variable-interest         at a         rate approximating the variable-rate on the obligation, thereby creating         the         economic equivalent of a fixed-rate obligation. Under the $19.0 million interest         rate swap, no payments are made by parties under the swap for monthly periods         in         which the variable-interest rate is greater than the predetermined knock-out         rate.
The         following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap         agreements and the fair value of each interest rate swap at January 28,         2006: Hedging Instrument Receive                   Variable Pay Fixed Knock-out Rate Expiration Fair Value $19.0                   million interest                   rate swap LIBOR 4.88% 7.75% 4/1/09 ($0.1                   million) $25.0                   million interest                   rate swap LIBOR 5.43% N/A 3/12/06 ($0.04                   million) 28 Table           of Contents Index             to Consolidated Financial             Statements Hypothetically, a 1% change in interest rates results in         approximately a $0.4 million change in the amount paid or received under         the         terms of the interest rate swap agreements on an annual basis. Due to many         factors, management is not able to predict the changes in fair value of our         interest rate swaps. The fair values are the estimated amounts we would pay         or         receive to terminate the agreements as of the reporting date. These fair         values         are obtained from an outside financial institution.

These consolidated financial statements are         the         responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an         opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our         audits.
We         conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company         Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that         we plan         and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial         statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,         on a         test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial         statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used         and         significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall         financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a         reasonable basis for our opinion.
In         our         opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present         fairly,         in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January         28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, and the results of their operations and their         cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 28,         2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting         principles.

The underlying assets of these short-term participation agreements are primarily       commercial notes. For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows,       the       Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities       of       three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Short-Term       Investments The       Companys short-term investments consist primarily of government-sponsored       municipal bonds and auction rate securities. These investments are classified       as       available for sale and are recorded at fair value. The government-sponsored       municipal bonds can be converted into cash depending on terms of the underlying       agreement. The auction rate securities have stated interest rates, which       typically reset to market prevailing rates every 35 days or less. The securities       underlying both the government-sponsored municipal bonds and the auction rate       securities have longer legal maturity dates.
Merchandise       Inventories Merchandise       inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or       market, determined on a weighted average cost basis. Cost is assigned to store       inventories using the retail inventory method, determined on a weighted average       cost basis.
Costs       directly associated with warehousing and distribution are capitalized as       merchandise inventories. Total warehousing and distribution costs capitalized       into inventory amounted to $25,265 and $27,968 at January 28, 2006 and January       29, 2005, respectively.
37 Table of Contents Index           to Consolidated Financial           Statements Property,       Plant and Equipment Property,       plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line       method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as       follows: Buildings 40                 years Furniture,                 fixtures and equipment 3                 to 15 years Transportation                 vehicles 4                 to 6 years Leasehold       improvements and assets held under capital leases are amortized over the       estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the committed terms of the       related leases, whichever is shorter. Amortization is included in "selling,       general and administrative expenses" on the accompanying consolidated statements       of operations.
In         the         fourth quarter of 2004, the Company revised its estimate of useful lives         on         certain store equipment and distribution center assets. This change increased         net income by approximately $3,700 in the first three quarters of 2005 as         compared to 2004.
Costs       incurred related to software developed for internal use are capitalized and       amortized over three years. Costs capitalized include those incurred in the       application development stage as defined in Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting       for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal       Use .
Impairment       of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed       Of The       Company reviews its long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets       for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the       carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, in accordance with Statement       of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting       for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets .       Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the       carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected       to be       generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the       impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying       amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets based on discounted       cash flows or other readily available evidence of fair value, if any. Assets       to       be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value       less costs to sell. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded charges       of $218, $531 and $234, respectively, to write down certain assets. These       charges are recorded as a component of "selling, general and administrative       expenses" in the accompanying consolidated statements of       operations.
Intangible       Assets Goodwill       and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but rather       tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with definite useful       lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed       for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The Company performs its annual       assessment of impairment following the finalization of each Novembers financial       statements.
Financial       Instruments The       Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to       market risks from changes in interest rates. By entering into receive-variable,       pay-fixed interest rate swaps, the Company limits its exposure to changes in       variable interest rates. The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in       the       event of non-performance by the counterparty to the interest rate swaps;       however, the counterparties are major financial institutions, and the risk       of       loss due to non-performance is considered remote. Interest rate differentials       paid or received on the swaps are recognized as adjustments to expense in the       period earned or incurred. The Company formally documents all hedging       relationships, if applicable, and assesses hedge effectiveness both at inception       and on an ongoing basis.
Certain       of the Companys interest rate swaps have not qualified for hedge accounting       treatment pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting       for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities .       As a       result, these interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value in the accompanying       consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities (see Note 6 ). Changes in the fair values of these interest rate       swaps are recorded as "interest expense and change in the fair value of       non-hedging interest rate swaps" in the accompanying consolidated statements       of       operations and the consolidated statements of cash flows, respectively.
The       Company is party to one interest rate swap that qualifies for hedge accounting       treatment pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133. Accordingly, the liability       is recorded at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and       changes in the fair value are recorded as a component of "accumulated other       comprehensive income (loss)." These amounts are subsequently reclassified into       earnings as a yield adjustment in the period in which the related interest       on       the variable-rate obligations affects earnings. If the swap is terminated prior       to its expiration date, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive       income (loss) will be recorded as a yield adjustment over the term of the       forecasted transaction.
38 Table of Contents Index           to Consolidated Financial           Statements Lease       Accounting The       Company recognized a one-time non-cash, after-tax adjustment of $5,751, or       $0.05       per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2004 to reflect the cumulative       impact of a correction of its accounting practices related to leased properties.       Of the aforementioned amount, approximately $1,230, or $0.01 per diluted share,       related to fiscal 2004. Consistent with industry practices, in prior periods,       the Company had reported its straight line expenses for leases beginning on       the       earlier of the store opening date or the commencement date of the lease. This       had the effect of excluding the pre-opening or build-out period of its stores       (generally 60 days) from the calculation of the period over which it expenses       rent. In addition, amounts received as tenant allowances were reflected in       the       balance sheet as a reduction to store leasehold improvement costs instead of       being classified as deferred lease credits. The adjustment made to correct       these       practices does not affect historical or future net cash flows or the timing       of       payments under related leases. Rather, this change affected the classification       of costs on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and cash       flows       by increasing depreciation and decreasing rent expense, which is included in       cost of sales. In addition, fixed assets and deferred liabilities increased       due       to the net cumulative unamortized allowances and abatements.
Revenue       Recognition The       Company recognizes sales revenue at the time a sale is made to its       customer.
Cost       of Sales The       Company includes the cost of merchandise, warehousing and distribution costs,       and certain occupancy costs in cost of sales.
Pre-Opening       Costs The       Company expenses pre-opening costs for new, expanded and relocated stores,       as       incurred.
Advertising       Costs The       Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred. Advertising costs       approximated $11,807, $11,042 and $5,681 for the years ended January 28, 2006,       January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively.
Income       Taxes Income       taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax       assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences       attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of       existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax       assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply       to       taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected       to       be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities       of a       change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the       enactment date of such change.
Stock-Based       Compensation The       Company applied the intrinsic value-based method of accounting prescribed by       Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting       for Stock Issued to Employees ,       and       related Interpretations in accounting for its fixed stock option plans. As       such,       compensation expense would be recorded on the date of grant only if the current       market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. SFAS No.       123, Accounting       for Stock-Based Compensation (FAS 123) ,       established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value-based       method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. As allowed       by       FAS 123, the Company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value-based       method of accounting described above, and has adopted the disclosure only       requirements of FAS 123, through fiscal 2005.
39 Table of Contents Index           to Consolidated Financial           Statements If       the       accounting provisions of FAS 123 had been adopted, the Company's net income       and       net income per share would have been as indicated in the following       table: Year                 Ended Year                 Ended Year                 Ended January                 28, January                 29, January                 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net                 income as reported $ 173,918 $ 180,250 $ 177,583 Add:                 Total stock-based employee compensation                 expense included in net income,                 net of related tax effects 95 - - Deduct:                 Total stock-based employee compensation                 expense determined under fair                 value based method, net                 of related tax effects 18,170 13,007 13,181 $ 155,843 $ 167,243 $ 164,402 Net                 income per share: Basic,                 as reported $ 1.61 $ 1.59 $ 1.55 Basic,                 pro forma under FAS 123 1.44 1.48 1.43 Diluted,                 as reported $ 1.60 $ 1.58 $ 1.54 Diluted,                 pro forma under FAS 123 1.44 1.47 1.43 On       December 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of       the       Company approved the acceleration of the vesting date of all previously issued,       outstanding and unvested options under all current stock option plans, including       the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2004       Executive Officer Equity Plan, effective as of December 15, 2005. At the       effective date, almost all of these options had exercise prices higher than       the       actual stock price. The Company made the decision to accelerate vesting of       these       options to give employees increased performance incentives and to enhance       current retention. This decision also eliminated non-cash compensation expense       that would have been recorded in future periods following the Companys adoption       of FAS 123R on January 29, 2006. Future compensation expense has been reduced       by       $14,881, over a period of four years during which the options would have vested,       as a result of the option acceleration program. This amount is net of       compensation expense of $150 recognized in fiscal 2005 for estimated forfeiture       of certain (in the money) options.
Effective       January 29, 2006 (the first day of fiscal 2006), the Company adopted SFAS No.       123, Share-Based       Payment (revised       2004) (FAS       123R). This statement is a revision of FAS 123 and supersedes Accounting       Principles Board Opinion No. 25. FAS 123R requires all share-based payments       to       employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in       the       financial statements based on their fair values. The Company will adopt FAS       123R       using the modified prospective method, which will require all share-based       payments granted on or after January 29, 2006 and all awards granted to       employees that were unvested as of January 29, 2006, to be accounted for using       the fair value method.
The       Company recognizes expense related to the fair value of any restricted stock       units (RSUs) granted during the year. The expense is recognized over the       requisite service period. The fair value of the RSUs is determined using the       closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant.
On       March       31, 2006, the Board of Directors granted approximately 286,500 restricted stock       units and options to purchase 317,500 shares of the Companys common stock under       the Companys Equity Incentive Plan and the Executive Officer Equity Incentive       Plan.
Net       Income Per Share Basic       net       income per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted       average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share reflects       the       potential dilution that could occur assuming the inclusion of dilutive potential       shares and has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average       number of shares and dilutive potential shares outstanding. Dilutive potential       shares include all outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock,       excluding variable restricted stock grants, after applying the treasury stock       method.

These assets are being amortized over the legal term of the individual         agreements. Certain of these agreements were amortized over five years and         as of         January 28, 2006, are fully amortized. One remaining agreement is being         amortized over a 10-year period. In addition, in 2003, the Company entered         into         non-competition agreements with former executives of Greenbacks, Inc. which         are         being amortized over five years (see Note 10 ).
Favorable         Lease Rights In         2005         and 2004, the Company acquired favorable lease rights for operating leases         for         retail locations from third parties. In addition, in 2003, the Company acquired         favorable lease rights in its acquisition of Greenbacks, Inc. (see Note 10 ). The Companys favorable lease rights are         amortized on a straight-line basis to rent expense over the remaining initial         lease terms, which expire at various dates through 2016. The weighted average         life remaining on the favorable lease rights at January 28, 2006 is 59         months.
Amortization         expense related to the non-competition agreements and favorable lease rights         was         $3,330, $1,551 and $1,300 for the years ended January 28, 2006, January 29,         2005         and January 31, 2004, respectively. Estimated annual amortization expense         for         the next five years follows: 2006 - $3,341; 2007 - $3,115; 2008 - $1,727;         2009 -         $892, and 2010 - $674.
Goodwill In         accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer being amortized, but         is         tested at least annually for impairment. In addition, goodwill will be tested         on         an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely         than not that an impairment loss has been incurred. The Company performed         its         annual impairment testing in November 2005 and determined that no impairment         loss existed.

In 2005, the Company         purchased these restricted investments to collateralize long-term insurance         obligations. These investments replaced higher cost stand by letters of credit         and surety bonds.
Other         Current Liabilities Other         current liabilities as of January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 consist of         accrued expenses for the following: January                 28, January                 29, 2006 2005 Compensation                 and benefits $ 22,210 $ 23,384 Taxes                 (other than income taxes) 15,783 11,992 Insurance 28,194 29,112 Other 32,679 40,791 Total                 other current liabilities $ 98,866 $ 105,279 Capital       Leases The       present value of future minimum capital lease payments as of January 28, 2006       is       as follows: 2006 $ 414 2007 317 2008 223 2009 114 2010 33 Total                   minimum lease payments 1,101 Less:                   amount representing interest (at                   an average rate of approximately 9.7%) 153 Present                   value of net minimum capital lease payments 948 Less                   current installments of obligations under capital                   leases 337 Obligations                   under capital leases, excluding current installments $ 611 42 Table of Contents Index         to Consolidated Financial         Statements Included       in property, plant and equipment at January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 are       leased furniture and fixtures and transportation vehicles with a cost of $2,088       and $4,465, respectively. Accumulated depreciation on these assets totaled       $1,053 and $2,964 at January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively.
Sale-Leaseback       Transaction On       September 30, 1999, the Company sold certain retail store leasehold improvements       to an unrelated third party and leased them back for a period of seven years.       This transaction was accounted for as a financing arrangement. In 2004, the       Company exercised the right to purchase the leasehold improvements at September       30, 2005. In order to exercise this right, the Companys lease obligation       increased by $200. As part of the original transaction, the Company received       proceeds of $20,880, net of financing costs, and an $8,120 11% note receivable.       During 2005, the Company paid $130, which satisfied the note receivable of       $11,605 and the remaining lease obligation of $11,735.
Fair       Value of Financial Instruments The       carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, other current       assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value       because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying values of       other       long-term financial assets and liabilities, excluding interest rate swaps and       restricted investments, approximate fair value because they are recorded using       discounted future cash flows or quoted market rates. Short-term investments       and       restricted investments are carried at fair value in accordance with SFAS No.       115, Accounting       for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities .
The       carrying value of the Company's variable-rate long-term debt approximates its       fair value because the debts interest rates vary with market interest rates.
It       is not       practicable to estimate the fair value of our outstanding commitments for       letters of credit and surety bonds without       unreasonable cost.
The       fair       value of the interest rate swaps (see Note 6 ) are the       estimated amounts the Company would pay to terminate the agreements as of the       reporting date. The fair value of the liabilities associated with interest       rate       swaps at January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 are as follows: January                   28, January                   29, 2006 2005 $25,000                   interest rate swap $ 37 $ 655 $19,000                   interest rate swap 129 893 $ 166 $ 1,548 The       fair       values of the interest rate swaps are included in "other liabilities" in the       accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities       are classified on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on the       classification of the underlying asset or liability. Significant components       of       the Company's net deferred tax assets (liabilities) follows: Year                   Ended Year                   Ended January                   28, January                   29, 2006 2005 Deferred                   tax assets: Accrued                   expenses and other liabilities principally due to differences                   in the timing of deductions for reserves $ 30,648 $ 14,744 Deferred                   compensation primarily due to timing of contributions                   to the profit sharing plan 922 - Other - 169 Total                   deferred tax assets 31,570 14,913 Deferred                   tax liabilities: Intangible                   assets due to differences in amortization                   methods and lives (8,013 ) (6,963 ) Deferred                   compensation primarily due to timing of contributions                   to the profit sharing plan - (855 ) Property                   and equipment due to difference in depreciation                   and amortization methods and lives (34,867 ) (39,435 ) Other (1,414 ) (1,663 ) Total                   deferred tax liabilities (44,294 ) (48,916 ) Net                   deferred tax liability $ (12,724 ) $ (34,003 ) In       assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether       it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes will       not be realized. Based upon the availability of carrybacks of future deductible       amounts to the past two years taxable income and management's projections for       future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are       deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the existing       deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods in which carrybacks       are available or in which the Company generates net taxable income. However,       there can be no assurance that the Company will generate any income or any       specific level of continuing income in future years.

45 Table of Contents Index         to Consolidated Financial         Statements Minimum       rental payments for operating leases do not include contingent rentals that       may       be paid under certain store leases based on a percentage of sales in excess       of       stipulated amounts. Future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by       expected future minimum sublease rentals of $1,545 under operating       leases.
Minimum       and Contingent Rentals Rental       expense for store and distribution center operating leases (including payments       to related parties) included in the accompanying consolidated statements of       operations are as follows: Year                   Ended Year                   Ended Year                   Ended January                   28, January                   29, January                   31, 2006 2005 2004 Minimum                   rentals $ 225,791 $ 200,718 $ 167,127 Contingent                   rentals 740 899 1,229 Non-Operating       Facilities The       Company is responsible for payments under leases for certain closed stores.       The       Company was also responsible for payments under leases for two former       distribution centers whose leases expired in June 2005 and September 2005.       The       Company accounts for abandoned lease facilities in accordance with SFAS No.       146, Accounting       for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities .       A       facility is considered abandoned on the date that the Company ceases to use       it.       On this date, the Company records an expense for the present value of the total       remaining costs for the abandoned facility reduced by any actual or probable       sublease income. Due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate recovery of       the       future lease and related payments, the Company recorded charges of $270, $1,472       and $470 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The       total       accrual for these vacated facilities was $124 and $1,472 at January 28, 2006       and       January 29, 2005, respectively.
Related       Parties The       Company also leases properties for six of its stores from partnerships owned       by       related parties. The total rental payments related to these leases were $490,       $484 and $469 for the years ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January       31, 2004, respectively. Total future commitments under related party leases       are       $1,922.
Freight       Services The       Company has contracted outbound freight services from various contract carriers       with contracts expiring through April 2008. The total amount of these       commitments is approximately $47,200, of which approximately $31,800 is       committed in 2006, $13,500 is committed in 2007 and $1,900 is committed in       2008.
Technology       Assets The       Company has commitments totaling approximately $6,466 to purchase store       technology assets for its stores during 2006.
Letters       of Credit In       March       2001, the Company entered into a Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security       Agreement. The agreement provides $125,000 for letters of credit. In December       2004, we entered into an additional Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security       Agreement, which provides $50,000 for letters of credit. Letters of credit       under       both of these agreements are generally issued for the routine purchase of       imported merchandise. Approximately $81,599 was committed to these letters       of       credit at January 28, 2006.
The       Company also has approximately $41,116 in letters of credit that serve as       collateral for its high-deductible insurance programs and expire in fiscal       2006.
Surety       Bonds The       Company has issued various surety bonds that primarily serve as collateral       for       utility payments at the Companys stores. The total amount of the commitment is       approximately $2,003, which is committed through various dates through 2007.
Contingencies In       2003,       the Company was served with a lawsuit in California state court by a former       employee who alleged that employees did not properly receive sufficient meal       breaks and paid rest periods. He also alleged other wage and hourly violations.       The suit requested that the California state court certify the case as a class       action. This suit was dismissed with prejudice in May 2005, and the dismissal       has been appealed. In May 2005, a new suit alleging similar claims was filed       in       California.
46 Table of Contents Index         to Consolidated Financial         Statements In       2005,       the Company was served with a lawsuit by former employees in Oregon who allege       that they did not properly receive sufficient meal breaks and paid rest periods.       They also allege other wage and hour violations. The plaintiffs have requested       the Oregon state court to certify the case as a class action.
In       2006,       the Company was served with a lawsuit by former employees in Washington who       allege that they did not properly receive sufficient meal breaks and paid rest       periods. They also allege other wage and hour violations. The plaintiffs have       requested the Washington state court to certify the case as a class action.
The       Company will vigorously defend itself in these lawsuits. The Company does not       believe that any of these matters will, individually or in the aggregate, have       a       material adverse effect on its business or financial condition. The Company       cannot give assurance, however, that one or more of these lawsuits will not       have       a material adverse effect on its results of operations for the period in which       they are resolved.
The       Company was served in another lawsuit that alleged various intellectual property       violations. The Company settled the lawsuit in May 2005. The terms of the       settlement are confidential and the Company is indemnified by a supplier.
NOTE       5 - LONG-TERM DEBT Long-term       debt at January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 consists of the       following: January                   28, January                   29, 2006 2005 $450,000                   Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, interest                   payable monthly at LIBOR, plus                   0.475%, which was 4.8% at January                   28, 2006, principal payable upon expiration                   of the facility in March 2009 $ 250,000 $ 250,000 Demand                   Revenue Bonds, interest payable monthly at                   a variable rate which was 4.6% at January                   28, 2006, principal payable on demand,                   maturing June 2018 19,000 19,000 Total                   long-term debt 269,000 269,000 Less                   current portion 19,000 19,000 Long-term                   debt, excluding current portion $ 250,000 $ 250,000 Maturities       of long-term debt are as follows: 2006 - $19,000 and 2009 -       $250,000.
Unsecured       Revolving Credit Facility In       March       2004, the Company entered into a five-year Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility       (the Facility). The Facility provides for a $450,000 revolving line of credit,       including up to $50,000 in available letters of credit, bearing interest at       LIBOR, plus 0.475%. The Facility also bears an annual facilities fee, calculated       as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the line of credit       and an annual administrative fee payable quarterly. The Facility, among other       things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios       restricts, the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence       of       certain new indebtedness. The Company used availability under the Facility       to       repay the $142,568 of variable-rate debt and to purchase short-term, state       and       local government-sponsored municipal bonds. The Companys $150,000 revolving       credit facility (Old Facility) was terminated concurrent with entering into       the       Facility. The net debt issuance costs related to the Old Facility and the       variable-rate debt, included in "other assets, net" on the January 31, 2004       consolidated balance sheet totaling $727, were charged to interest expense       in       2004.
47 Table of Contents Index         to Consolidated Financial         Statements Demand       Revenue Bonds On       May       20, 1998, the Company entered into an unsecured Loan Agreement with the       Mississippi Business Finance Corporation (MBFC) under which the MBFC issued       Taxable Variable Rate Demand Revenue Bonds (the Bonds) in an aggregate principal       amount of $19,000 to finance the acquisition, construction, and installation       of       land, buildings, machinery and equipment for the Company's distribution facility       in Olive Branch, Mississippi. The Bonds do not contain a prepayment penalty       as       long as the interest rate remains variable. The Bonds contain a demand provision       and, therefore, are classified as current liabilities.
NOTE       6 - DERIVATIVE       FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The       fair       value of interest rate swaps at January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, is       approximately $166 and $1,548, respectively, and is recorded in "other       liabilities" on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Non-Hedging       Derivatives At       January 28, 2006, the Company was party to a derivative instrument in the form       of an interest rate swap that does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment       pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133 because it contains a knock-out       provision. The swap creates the economic equivalent of a fixed rate obligation       by converting the variable-interest rate to a fixed rate. Under this interest       rate swap, the Company pays interest to a financial institution at a fixed       rate,       as defined in the agreement. In exchange, the financial institution pays the       Company at a variable interest rate, which approximates the floating rate on       the       variable-rate obligation, excluding the credit spread. The interest rate on       the       swap is subject to adjustment monthly. No payments are made by either party       for       months in which the variable-interest rate, as calculated under the swap       agreement, is greater than the "knock-out rate." The following table summarizes       the terms of the interest rate swap: Derivative Origination Expiration Pay                 Fixed Knock-out Instrument Date Date Rate Rate $19,000                 swap 4/1/99 4/1/09 4.88% 7.75% This       swap       reduces the Company's exposure to the variable interest rate related to the       Demand Revenue Bonds (see Note 5 ).
Hedging       Derivative The       Company is party to one derivative instrument in the form of an interest rate       swap that qualifies for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to the provisions       of       SFAS No. 133.
In       2001,       the Company entered into a $25,000 interest rate swap agreement (swap) to manage       the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of the       Company's variable interest entity debt. In March 2004, the Company repaid       all       of the variable interest entity debt with borrowings from the Facility (see Note 5 ). The Company redesignated this swap to borrowings       under the Facility. This redesignation does not affect the accounting treatment       used for this interest rate swap. The swap creates the economic equivalent       of       fixed-rate debt by converting the variable-interest rate to a fixed-rate. Under       this agreement, the Company pays interest to a financial institution at a       fixed-rate of 5.43%. In exchange, the financial institution pays the Company       at       a variable-interest rate, which approximates the floating rate on the debt,       excluding the credit spread. The interest rate on the swap is subject to       adjustment monthly consistent with the interest rate adjustment on the debt.       The       swap expired in March 2006.
NOTE       7 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Preferred       Stock The       Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.01       par       value per share. No preferred shares are issued and outstanding at January       28,       2006 and January 29, 2005.

NOTE       8 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Profit       Sharing and 401(k) Retirement Plan The       Company maintains a defined contribution profit sharing and 401(k) plan which       is       available to all employees over 21 years of age who have completed one year       of       service in which they have worked at least 1,000 hours. Eligible employees       may       make elective salary deferrals. The Company may make contributions at its       discretion.
Contributions       to and reimbursements by the Company of expenses of the plans included in the       accompanying consolidated statements of operations were as follows: Year                 Ended January 28, 2006 $ 6,885 Year                 Ended January 29, 2005 8,530 Year                 Ended January 31, 2004 10,964 Deferred       Compensation Plan The       Company has a deferred compensation plan which provides certain highly       compensated employees and executives the ability to defer a portion of their       base compensation and bonuses and earn interest on their deferred amounts.       The       plan is an unfunded nonqualified plan; however, the Company may make       discretionary contributions. The deferred amounts and earnings thereon are       payable to participants, or designated beneficiaries, at specified future dates,       upon retirement or death. Total cumulative participant deferrals were       approximately $2,050 and $1,516, respectively, at January 28, 2006 and January       29, 2005 and are included in "other liabilities" on the accompanying       consolidated balance sheets. The related assets are included in "other assets,       net" on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company made no       discretionary contributions in the years ended January 28, 2006, January 29,       2005 and January 31, 2004.
NOTE       9 - STOCK-BASED       COMPENSATION PLANS At       January 28, 2006, the Company has eight stock-based compensation plans. Each       plan and the accounting method are described below.
Fixed       Stock-Option Compensation Plans Under       the       Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (SOP), the Company granted options to its       employees for 1,047,264 shares of Common Stock in 1993 and 1,048,289 shares       in       1994. Options granted under the SOP have an exercise price of $0.86 and are       fully vested at the date of grant.
Under       the       1995 Stock Incentive Plan (SIP), the Company may grant options to its employees       for the purchase of up to 12,600,000 shares of Common Stock. The exercise price       of each option equals the market price of the Company's stock at the date of       grant, unless a higher price is established by the Board of Directors, and       an       option's maximum term is 10 years. Options granted under the SIP generally       vested over a three-year period. In exchange for their options to purchase       Dollar Express Common Stock, certain employees of Dollar Express were granted       228,072 options to purchase the Company's common stock based on an exchange       ratio of 0.8772. Options issued in connection with the merger were fully vested       as of the date of the merger. This plan was terminated on July 1, 2003 and       replaced with the Companys 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, discussed       below.
The       Step       Ahead Investments, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (SAI Plan) provided for the       issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock and       restricted stock awards to officers and key employees. Effective with the merger       with 98 Cent Clearance Center in December 1998 and in accordance with the terms       of the SAI Plan, outstanding 98 Cent Clearance Center options were assumed       by       the Company and converted, based on 1.6818 Company options for each 98 Cent       Clearance Center option, to options to purchase the Company's common stock.       Options issued as a result of this conversion were fully vested as of the date       of the merger.
50 Table of Contents Index         to Consolidated Financial         Statements Under       the       1998 Special Stock Option Plan (Special Plan), options to purchase 247,500       shares were granted to five former officers of 98 Cent Clearance Center who       were       serving as employees or consultants of the Company following the merger. The       options were granted as consideration for entering into non-competition       agreements and a consulting agreement. The exercise price of each option equals       the market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant, and the options'       maximum term is 10 years. Options granted under the Special Plan vested over       a       five-year period.
The       2003       Equity Incentive Plan (EIP) replaces the Company's SIP discussed above. Under       the EIP, the Company may grant up to 6,000,000 shares of its Common Stock,       plus       any shares available for future awards under the SIP, to the Companys       employees, including executive officers and independent contractors. The EIP       permits the Company to grant equity awards in the form of stock options, stock       appreciation rights and restricted stock. The exercise price of each stock       option granted equals the market price of the Companys stock at the date of       grant. The options generally vest over a three-year period and have a maximum       term of 10 years.
The       2004       Executive Officer Equity Plan (EOEP) is available only to the Chief Executive       Officer and certain other executive officers. These officers no longer receive       awards under the EIP. The EOEP allows the Company to grant the same type of       equity awards as does the EIP. These awards generally vest over a three-year       period, with a maximum term of 10 years.
In       2005,       the Company granted 270,407 RSUs from the 2003 EIP and the 2004 EOEP to its       employees and officers. The fair value of these RSUs of $6,759 is being expensed       ratably over the three-year vesting periods. The fair value was determined       using       the Companys closing stock price on the date of grant. The Company recognized       $1,497 of expense related to the RSUs for the year ended January 28,       2006.
In       2005,       the Company granted 40,000 RSUs from the 2004 EOEP to certain officers of the       Company, contingent on the Company meeting certain performance targets in 2005       and future service of these officers through various points through July 2007.       The Company met these performance targets in fiscal 2005; therefore, the fair       value of these RSUs of $1,001 is being expensed over the service period. The       fair value of these RSUs was determined using the Companys closing stock price       January 28, 2006 (the last day of fiscal 2005), when the performance targets       were satisfied. The Company recognized $725 in compensation expense related       to       these RSUs in the year ended January 28, 2006.
Stock       appreciation rights may be awarded alone or in tandem with stock options. When       the stock appreciation rights are exercisable, the holder may surrender all       or a       portion of the unexercised stock appreciation right and receive in exchange       an       amount equal to the excess of the fair market value at the date of exercise       over       the fair market value at the date of the grant. No stock appreciation rights       have been granted to date.
Any       restricted stock or RSUs awarded are subject to certain general restrictions.       The restricted stock shares may not be sold, transferred, pledged or disposed       of       until the restrictions on the shares have lapsed or have been removed under       the       provisions of the plan. In addition, if a holder of the restricted shares ceases       to be employed by the Company, any shares in which the restrictions have not       lapsed will be forfeited.
The       2003       Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan provides non-qualified stock options       to       non-employee members of the Company's Board of Directors. The stock options       are       functionally equivalent to such options issued under the EIP discussed above.       The exercise price of each stock option granted equals the market price of       the       Companys stock at the date of grant. The options generally vest immediately.
The       2003       Director Deferred Compensation Plan permits any of the Company's directors       who       receive a retainer or other fees for Board or committee service to defer all       or       a portion of such fees until a future date, at which time they may be paid       in       cash or shares of the Company's common stock, or to receive all or a portion       of       such fees in non-statutory stock options. Deferred fees that are paid out in       cash will earn interest at the 30-year Treasury Bond Rate. If a director elects       to be paid in common stock, the number of shares will be determined by dividing       the deferred fee amount by the current market price of a share of the Company's       common stock. The number of options issued to a director will equal the deferred       fee amount divided by 33% of the price of a share of the Company's common stock.       The exercise price will equal the fair market value of the Company's common       stock at the date the option was issued. The options are fully vested when       issued and have a term of 10 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), the Company is       authorized to issue up to 1,040,780 shares       of       common stock to eligible employees. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees       can       choose to have up to 10% of their annual base earnings withheld to purchase       the       Company's common stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower       of       the price at the beginning or the end of the quarterly offering period. Under       the ESPP, the Company has sold 792,813 shares as of January 28,       2006.
The       fair       value of the employees' purchase rights is estimated on the date of grant using       the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average       assumptions: Fiscal                   2005 Fiscal                   2004 Fiscal                   2003 Expected                   term 3                   months 3                   months 3                   months Expected                   volatility 12.0 % 15.6 % 19.8 % Annual                   dividend yield - - - Risk                   free interest rate 3.9 % 2.1 % 1.1 % The       weighted average per share fair value of those purchase rights granted in 2005,       2004, and 2003 was $4.11, $4.93 and $4.60, respectively.
NOTE       10 - ACQUISITION On       June       29, 2003, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of       Greenbacks, Inc. (Greenbacks). The results of Greenbacks operations are       included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since that date.       Greenbacks was a privately held company operating 100 stores in 10 western       states and one expandable 252,000 square foot distribution center in Salt Lake       City. As a result of this acquisition, the Company extended its geographical       reach to include 47 states compared with 41 states prior to the acquisition.       In       addition, this acquisition provided the Company with an expandable distribution       infrastructure in the Rocky Mountain area of the country. The aggregate purchase       price was approximately $100,000 and was paid in cash. In addition, the Company       incurred approximately $800 in direct costs associated with the acquisition.       The       following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities       assumed at the date of acquisition.

The       non-compete agreements are with former key executives of Greenbacks. They are       being amortized over five years, the weighted average term of the agreements.       The favorable lease rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis to       rent       expense over the remaining initial lease terms, which expire at various dates       through 2012.
NOTE       11 - INVESTMENT On       August       7, 2003, the Company paid $4,000 to acquire a 10.5% fully diluted interest       in       Ollie's Holdings, Inc. (Ollie's), a multi-price point discount retailer located       in the mid-Atlantic region. In addition, the SKM Equity Fund III, L.P. (SKM       Equity) and SKM Investment Fund (SKM Investment) acquired a combined fully       diluted interest in Ollie's of 53.1%. Two of the Company's directors, Thomas       Saunders and John Megrue, are principal members of SKM Partners, L.L.C., which       serves as the general partner of SKM Equity. John Megrue is also a       principal member of Apax Partners, L.P., which serves as the genreal partner       for       SKM Investment. In conjunction with the acquisition of its interest in Ollie's,       the Company also entered into a call option agreement. The option agreement       provides the Company       with the right to purchase all of SKM Equity's and SKM Investment's equity       in       Ollie's, for a fixed price as set forth in the agreement, subject to adjustments       dependent on the occurrence of certain future events. The Company has no       obligation to exercise the option or make any additional investment in Ollie's.       The $4,000 investment in Ollie's is accounted for under the cost method of       accounting and is included in "other assets" in the accompanying consolidated       balance sheets.
53 Table         of Contents Index           to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE       12 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT - In       March       2006, the Company completed its acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores for       approximately $30,500 of store related assets and $22,200 of store and       distribution center inventory. These amounts are subject to post closing       adjustments based on the results of physical inventory counts. These stores       are       primarily in the Midwest part of the United States and the Company has existing       logistics capacity to service these stores with no additional capital       expenditure. This acquisition also includes a few combo stores that offer an       expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than       $1.       Substantially all Deal$ stores acquired will continue to operate under the       Deal$       banner while providing the Company an opportunity to leverage its Dollar Tree       infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts, including higher       price points without disrupting the single-price point model in its Dollar       Tree       stores.

Item       9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation       of disclosure controls and procedures We       maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that       information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and       reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the       Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated       and       communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief       Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required       disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,       we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed       and       operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control       objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply our judgment in       evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and       procedures.
Our       management has carried out, with the participation of the Companys Chief       Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the       effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in       Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our chief       executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that, as of January       28, 2006, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective to       provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed       by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,       processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in       Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.
Managements       Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The       Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate       internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule       13a-15(f). The Companys management conducted an assessment of the Companys       internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established       by       the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal       Control-Integrated Framework .       Based       on this assessment, the Companys management has concluded that, as of January       28, 2006, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.       The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has       audited the Companys consolidated financial statements and has issued an       attestation report on managements assessment of the Companys internal control       over financial reporting. Their report appears below.
Changes       in internal controls There       were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting       that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially       affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control       over financial reporting.
Report       of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The       Board       of Directors and Stockholders Dollar       Tree Stores, Inc.: We       have       audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Managements       Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting , that       Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (the Company) maintained effective internal control       over financial reporting as of January 28, 2006, based on criteria established       in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework , issued       by       the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission       (COSO) .
The       Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control       over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal       control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion       on       management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys       internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We       conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company       Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we       plan       and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective       internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material       respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control       over       financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating       the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing       such       other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe       that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
55 Table       of Contents Index         to Consolidated Financial         Statements A       company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to       provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting       and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance       with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control       over       financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain       to       the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly       reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)       provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to       permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted       accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are       being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors       of       the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely       detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys       assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because       of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may       not       prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of       effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become       inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance       with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In       our       opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal       control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2006, is fairly stated,       in       all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework , issued       by       the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission       (COSO).
Also,       in       our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective       internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2006, based on criteria       established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework ,       issued       by the Committee of       Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) .
We       also       have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting       Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Dollar       Tree       Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005,       and       the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and       comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year       period ended January 28, 2006, and our report dated April 5, 2006 expressed       an       unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
