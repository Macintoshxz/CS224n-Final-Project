Table       of Contents 5 PART       I Item       1. BUSINESS Overview Since       our       founding in 1986, we have become the leading operator of discount variety stores       offering merchandise at the fixed price of $1.00. We believe the variety and       quality of products we sell for $1.00 sets us apart from our competitors. At       February 3, 2007, we operated 3,219 discount variety retail stores.       Approximately 3,100 of these stores sell substantially all items for $1.00       or       less. The remaining stores, operating as Deal$, which were acquired in March       2006, sell many items for $1.00 or less but also sell items at prices greater       than $1.00. Our stores operate under the names of Dollar Tree, Deal$, Dollar       Bills and Dollar Express.
In       the       past five years, we have modified our average store size to reflect what we       believe is our optimal store size of between 10,000 and 12,500 square feet.       At       February 3, 2007, approximately 17% of our stores are less than 6,000 square       feet, which is down from approximately 47% of our stores at December 31, 2002.       These smaller stores are comprised of mall and older strip shopping center       locations and are candidates for relocation as their leases expire. Our current       store size reflects our expanded merchandise offerings and improved service       to       our customers. As we have been expanding our merchandise offerings, we have       added freezers and coolers to approximately 700 stores during the past two       years       to increase traffic and transaction size. At December 31, 2002, we operated       2,263 stores in 40 states. At February 3, 2007, we operated 3,219 stores in       48       states. Our selling square footage increased from approximately 13.0 million       square feet in December 2002 to 26.3 million square feet in February 2007.       Our       store growth since 2002 has resulted from opening new stores and completing       mergers and acquisitions. We centrally manage our store and distribution       operations from our corporate headquarters in Chesapeake, Virginia.
Business       Strategy Value       Merchandise Offering .       We       strive to exceed our customers' expectations of the variety and quality of       products that they can purchase for $1.00 by offering items that we believe       typically sell for higher prices elsewhere. We buy approximately 60% to 65%       of       our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 35% to 40%. Our domestic       purchases include closeouts. We believe our mix of imported and domestic       merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently       exceed the customer's expectation. In addition, direct relationships with       manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize       packaging,product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers'       needs.
Mix       of Basic Variety and Seasonal Merchandise.
We       maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store       categories. We offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we       supplement these basic, everyday items with seasonal and closeout merchandise.       We attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores       continuously to establish our stores as a destination and increased slightly       the       mix of consumable merchandise in order to increase the traffic in our stores.       Closeout merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than       10%       of our purchases. National, regional and private-label brands have become a       bigger part of our merchandise mix.
Our       merchandise mix consists of:  consumable                 merchandise, which includes candy and food, basic health and beauty                 care,                 and household consumables such as paper, plastics and household chemicals                 and in select stores, frozen and refrigerated food;  variety                 merchandise, which includes toys, durable housewares, gifts, fashion                 health and beauty care, party goods, greeting cards, apparel, and                 other                 items; and  seasonal                 goods, which include Easter, Halloween and Christmas merchandise,                 along                 with summer toys and lawn and garden                 merchandise.
Table       of Contents 6 We       have       added freezers and coolers to certain stores which have increased the consumable       merchandise carried by our stores. We believe this initiative helps us drive       additional transactions and allows us to appeal to a broader demographic mix,       and these stores will carry more consumable merchandise than stores without       freezers. We have added freezers and coolers to approximately 400 more stores       in       2006. Therefore, as of February 3, 2007, we have freezers and coolers in       approximately 700 of our stores. We plan to add them to approximately 250 more       stores in 2007. As a result of the installation of freezers and coolers in       select stores, consumable merchandise has grown as a percentage of purchases       and       sales and we expect this trend to continue. The following table shows the       percentage of purchases of each major product group for the years ended February       3, 2007 and January 28, 2006: February                 3, January                 28, Merchandise                 Type 2007 2006 Variety                 categories 48.9% 47.2% Consumable 45.3% 44.9% Seasonal 5.8% 7.9% Customer       Payment Methods.
All       of       our stores accept cash and checks and approximately 700 stores accept Visa       and       MasterCard credit cards .
Prior       to       May 2005, approximately 900 of our stores accepted debit cards. By the end       of       2005, approximately 2,300 of our stores accepted debit cards and as of the       end       of 2006, all of our stores accept debit cards. Along with the shift to more       consumables, the rollout of freezers and coolers and the acceptance of pin-based       debit transactions, we increased the number of stores accepting Electronic       Benefits Transfer cards and food stamps at qualified stores in the current       year.       We believe that expanding our tender types has helped increase both the traffic       and the average size of transactions at our stores in the current year.

We       primarily focus on opening new stores in strip shopping centers anchored by       mass       merchandisers, whose target customers we believe to be similar to ours, and       in       neighborhood centers anchored by large grocery retailers. Our stores have proven       successful in metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities and small towns. The range       of       our store sizes allows us to target a particular location with a store that       best       suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities.       Our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for       shoppers by using bright lighting, vibrant colors, decorative signs and       background music. We enhance the store design with attractive merchandise       displays. We believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances       our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store.
For       more       information on retail locations and retail store leases, see       "Properties." Profitable       Stores with Strong Cash Flow.
We       maintain a disciplined, cost-sensitive approach to store site selection in       order       to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential       to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows. We believe that our       stores have a relatively small shopping radius, which allows us to profitably       concentrate multiple stores within a single market. Our ability to open new       stores is dependent upon, among other factors, locating suitable sites and       negotiating favorable lease terms.
Our       older, smaller stores continue to generate significant store-level operating       income and operating cash flows and have some of the highest operating margin       rates among our stores; however, the increased size of our newer stores allows       us to offer a wider selection of products, including more basic consumable       merchandise, thereby making them more attractive as a destination       store.
The       strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to self-fund infrastructure       investment and new stores. Over the past five years, cash flows from operating       activities have exceeded capital expenditures.
For       more       information on our results of operations, see "Management's Discussion and       Analysis - Results of Operations." For more information on seasonality of sales,       see "Management's Discussion and Analysis - Seasonality and Quarterly       Fluctuations." Cost       Control .       We       believe that substantial buying power at the $1.00 price point contributes       to       our successful purchasing strategy, which includes disciplined, targeted       merchandise margin goals by category. We believe our disciplined buying and       quality merchandise help to minimize markdowns. We buy products on an       order-by-order basis and have no material long-term purchase contracts or other       assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost. No vendor       accounted for more than 10% of total merchandise purchased in any of the past       five years.
Table       of Contents 7 Our       supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information       to       assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores. Controlling       our inventory levels has resulted in more efficient distribution and store       operations.
Information       Systems.
We       believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control       costs. Our inventory management system has allowed us to improve the efficiency       of our supply chain, improve merchandise flow and control distribution and       store       operating costs.
Our       automatic replenishment system automatically reorders key items, based on actual       store level sales and inventory. In 2005 and 2006, we rolled out this system       to       additional stores and merchandise categories. At the end of 2006, we had over       800 basic, everyday items on automatic replenishment. As we continue to utilize       this system, our store management has more time to focus on customer focused       activities.
Point-of-sale       data allows us to track sales by merchandise category at the store level and       assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory. We believe that this       information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the       quantities commensurate with selling patterns. Using this point-of-sale data       for       planning purchases of inventory has helped us reduce our inventory per       store approximately       12% in 2005 as compared to 2004 and an additional 5% in 2006 compared to 2005.       Our inventory turns also increased 70 basis points in the current       year.
Corporate       Culture and Values.
We       believe that honesty and integrity, doing the right things for the right       reasons, and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within       our       corporate culture. We believe that running a business, and certainly a public       company, carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making       operational and financial decisions. Our management team visits and shops our       stores like every customer; we have an open door policy for all our associates;       and ideas and individual creativity are encouraged. We have standards for store       displays, merchandise presentation, and store operations. Our distribution       centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually       everyone in our store support center is available to assist associates in the       stores and distribution centers.
Our       disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls       over financial reporting and ensures that our public filings contain discussions       about the risks our business faces. We believe that we have the controls in       place to be able to certify our financial statements. Additionally, we have       complied with the updated listing requirements for the Nasdaq Stock       Market.
Growth       Strategy Store       Openings and Square Footage Growth.
The       primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store       openings, an active store expansion and remodel program, and selective mergers       and acquisitions. From 2002 to 2006, net sales increased at a compound annual       growth rate of 14.3%. We expect that the substantial majority of our future       sales growth will come primarily from new store openings andfrom our store       expansion and relocation program.
The       following table shows the total selling square footage of our stores and the       selling square footage per new store opened over the last five years. Our growth       and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because       our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate       measure of store productivity. The selling square footage statistics for 2002       through 2006 are estimates based on the relationship of selling to gross square       footage.
Year Number                   of Stores Average                   Selling Square Footage Per Store Average                   Selling Square Footage Per New Store Opened 2002 2,263 5,763 7,783 2003 2,513 6,716 9,948 2004 2,735 7,475 10,947 2005 2,914 7,900 9,756 2006 3,219 8,160 8,780 Table       of Contents 8 We       expect       to increase our selling square footage in the future by opening new stores       in       underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing       markets via new store openings and store expansions (expansions include store       relocations). In fiscal 2007 and beyond, we plan to predominantly open stores       that are approximately 9,000 selling square feet and we believe this size allows       us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand. At       February 3, 2007, 1,094 of our stores, totaling 50.5% of our selling square       footage, were 9,000 selling square feet or larger .
In       addition to new store openings, we plan to continue our store expansion program       to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities.       We target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square       foot and changes in market opportunities. Stores targeted for expansion are       generally less than 6,000 selling square feet in size. Store expansions       generally increase the existing store size by approximately 6,000 selling square       feet.
Since       1995, we have added a total of 609 stores through four mergers and several       small       acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy has been to target companies with a       similar single price point concept that have shown success in operations or       provide a strategic advantage. We evaluate potential acquisition opportunities       in our retail sector as they become available.
On       March       25, 2006, we completed our acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores and paid $32.0       million for store-related and other assets and $22.1 million forinventory.       These stores are located primarily in the Midwest part of the United States       and       we have existing logistics capacity to service these stores. This acquisition       also included a few combo stores that offer an expanded assortment of       merchandise including items that sell for more than $1. Substantially all Deal$       stores acquired continue to operate under the Deal$ banner while providing       us an       opportunity to leverage our Dollar Tree infrastructure in the testing of new       merchandise concepts, including higher price points, without disrupting the       single-price point model in our Dollar Tree stores.
In       2006,       we also acquired the rights to 21 store leases through bankruptcy proceedings       of       certain discount retailers. We will take advantage of these opportunities as       they arise in the future.
Merchandising       and Distribution.
Expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans. We plan to       continue to stock our new stores with the ever-changing merchandise that our       current customers have come to appreciate. In addition, we are opening larger       stores that contain more basic consumable merchandise to attract new customers.       Consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our       stores resulting in increased sales. The presentation and display of merchandise       in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating       a more exciting shopping experience. We believe our approach to visual       merchandising results in higher store traffic, higher sales volume and an       environment that encourages impulse purchases.
A       strong       and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to       maintain a low-cost operating structure. We expect to continue to add       distribution capacity to support our store opening plans, with the aim of       remaining approximately one year ahead of our distribution needs. In 2007,       we       are planning to add capacity to our Briar Creek distribution center which       services the northeast part of the country. We believe these distribution       centers, including the planned expansion of the Briar Creek distribution center,       in total are capable of supporting approximately $5.0 billion in annual sales.       Based on current plans, we will not need to add any additional distribution       capacity until at least 2008. New distribution sites are strategically located       to reduce stem miles, maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store       service areas.
Our       stores receive approximately 95% of their inventory from our distribution       centers via contract carriers. The remaining store inventory, primarily       perishable consumable items and other vendor-maintained display items, are       delivered directly to our stores from vendors. For more information on our       distribution center network, see Properties.
Competition The       retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase       in       the future. Our value discount retail competitors include Family Dollar, Dollar       General and 99 Cents Only. Family Dollar and Dollar General sell items for       more       than $1 while 99 Cents only sells items at the $0.99 price point or below.       The       principal methods of competition include closeout merchandise, convenience       and       the quality of merchandise offered to the customer. Though we are predominantly       a fixed-price point retailer, we also compete with mass merchandisers, such       as       Wal-Mart and Target, and regional discount retailers. In addition, several       mass       merchandisers and grocery store chains carry "dollar store" or dollar zone concepts in their stores, which increases competition. Our sales and profits       could be reduced by increases in competition, especially because there are       no       significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail       sector.
Table       of Contents 9 Trademarks We       are       the owners of federal service mark registrations for "Dollar Tree," the "Dollar       Tree" logo, "1 Dollar Tree" together with the related design, and "One       Price...One Dollar." We also own a concurrent use registration for "Dollar       Bill$" and the related logo. During 1997, we acquired the rights to use trade       names previously owned by Everything's A Dollar, a former competitor in the       $1.00 price point industry. Several trade names were included in the purchase,       including the marks "Everything's $1.00 We Mean Everything," and "Everything's       $1.00," the registration of which is pending. With the acquisition of Dollar       Express, we became the owner of the service marks "Dollar Express" and "Dollar       Expres$." We       became       the owners of the "Greenbacks All A Dollar" and "All A Dollar" service marks,       with the acquisition of Greenbacks. We also became the owners of Deal$ and Deal$ Nothing Over A Dollar trademarks, with the acquisition of Deal$. We have       applied for federal trademark registrations for various private labels that       we       use to market some of our product lines.
Employees We       employed approximately 12,700 full-time and 29,500 part-time associates on       February 3, 2007. The number of part-time associates fluctuates depending on       seasonal needs. We consider our relationship with our associates to be good,       and       we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor       disagreements. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining       agreements.
Item       1A. RISK FACTORS An       investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should       carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all       other information included or incorporated in this report. Any of the following       risks may materialize, and additional risks not known to us, or that we now       deem       immaterial, may arise. In such event, our business, financial condition, results       of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that       occurs, the market price of our common stock could fall, and you could lose       all       or part of your investment.
Our       profitability is especially vulnerable to cost       increases.
Future       increase in costs such as the cost of merchandise, wage levels, shipping rates,       freight costs, fuel costs and store occupancy costs may reduce our       profitability. As a fixed price retailer, we cannot raise the sales price of       our       merchandise to offset cost increases. Unlike multi-price retailers, we are       primarily dependent on our ability to operate more efficiently or increase       our       comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation. We expect comparable       store net sales will increase approximately 1% to 3% in 2007. We can give you       no       assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future. Please       see       Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results       of Operations," of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the effect of       Inflation and Other Economic Factors on our operations.
Our       profitability is affected by the mix of products we       sell.
Our       gross       profit could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we       sell       in the future. In recent years, the percentage of our sales from higher cost       consumable products has increased and is likely to increase in the first half       of       2007. Our gross profit will decrease, primarily in the first two quarters in       2007, unless we are able to increase the amount of our net sales sufficiently       to       offset any decrease in our product margin percentage. We can give you no       assurance that we will be able to do so.
We       may be unable to expand our square footage as profitably as       planned.
We       plan       to expand our selling square footage by approximately 10% in 2007 to increase       our sales and profits. Expanding our square footage profitably depends on a       number of uncertainties, including our ability to locate, lease, build out       and       open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable       economic terms. We must also open or expand stores within our established       geographic markets, where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our       existing stores. We may not manage our expansion effectively, and our failure       to       achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business,       financial condition and results of operations.
Table       of Contents 10 A       downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our sales.
Economic       conditions, such as those caused by recession, inflation, adverse weather       conditions, or terrorism, could reduce consumer spending or cause customers       to       shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as       profitably. Adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and       significantly reduce our sales.
Our       sales and profits rely on imported merchandise, which may increase in cost       or       become unavailable.
Merchandise       imported directly from overseas accounts for approximately 35% to 40% of our       total purchases at retail. In addition, we believe that a small portion of       our       goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported. China is the source of a       substantial majority of our imports. Imported goods are generally less expensive       than domestic goods and increase our profit margins. A disruption in the flow       of       our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may       significantly decrease our profits. Risks associated with our reliance on       imported goods include:  disruptions                 in the flow of imported goods because of factors such                 as: o raw                 material shortages, work stoppages, strikes and political                 unrest; o problems                 with oceanic shipping, including shipping container shortages;                 and o economic                 crises and international disputes.
increases                 in the cost of purchasing or shipping foreign merchandise, resulting                 from: o increases                 in shipping rates imposed by the trans-Pacific ocean carriers; o changes                 in currency exchange rates and local economic conditions, including                 inflation in the country of origin; o failure                 of the United States to maintain normal trade relations with China;                 and o import                 duties, import quotas and other trade                 sanctions.
We       could encounter disruptions or additional costs in receiving and distributing       merchandise.
Our       success depends on our ability to transport merchandise from our suppliers       to       our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and       cost-effective manner. We may not anticipate, respond to or control all of       the       challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems. Some of the       factors that could have an adverse effect on our shipping and receiving systems       or costs are:  Shipping.
Our                 oceanic shipping schedules may be disrupted or delayed from time                 to time.                 We also have experienced shipping rate increases over the last several                 years imposed by the trans-Pacific ocean                 carriers.
Diesel                 fuel costs.
We have experiencedincreases in diesel fuel                 costs over the past few years.
Vulnerability                   to natural or man-made disasters.
A                   fire, explosion or natural disaster at any of our distribution                   facilities                   could result in a loss of merchandise and impair our ability to                   adequately                   stock our stores. Some of our facilities are especially vulnerable                   to                   earthquakes, hurricanes or                   tornadoes.
Labor                 disagreement.
Labor disagreements or disruptions may result in delays in the delivery                 of                 merchandise to our stores and increase                 costs.
War,                 terrorism and other events.
War and acts of terrorism in the United States, or in China or other                 parts                 of Asia where we buy a significant amount of our imported merchandise,                 could disrupt our supply chain.
Sales       below our expectations during peak seasons may cause our operating results       to       suffer materially.
Our       highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons. We generally realize       a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our       operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation, we stock       extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to supplement our stores.       An       economic downturn during these periods could adversely affect our operating       results, particularly operating and net income, to a greater extent than if       a       downturn occurred at other times of the year. Untimely merchandise delays due       to       receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect. Sales during       the       Easter selling season are materially affected by the timing of the Easter       holiday. Easter in fiscal 2006 was on April 16 th ,       while       in fiscal 2007, it will be one week earlier on April 8 th .
Table       of Contents 11 Pressure       from competitors may reduce our sales and profits.
The       retail industry is highly competitive. The marketplace is highly fragmented       as       many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of       store formats and merchandising strategies. We expect competition to increase       in       the future because there are no significant economic barriers for others to       enter our retail sector. Many of our current or potential competitors have       greater financial resources than we do. We cannot guarantee that we will       continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future       competitors. Please see Item 1 Business, of this Form 10-K for further       discussion of the effect of competition on our operations.
The       resolution of certain legal matters could have a material adverse effect on       our       results of operations, accrued liabilities and cash.
For       a       discussion of current legal matters, please see Item 3. Legal Proceedings of       this Form 10-K. Resolution of certain matters described in that item, if decided       against the Company, could have a material adverse effect on our results of       operations, accrued liabilities or cash flows.
Certain       provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage       a takeover attempt that may be in a shareholder's best       interest.
Our       articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or       discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best       interest. These provisions, among other things:  classify                 our board of directors into three classes, each of which serves for                 different three-year periods;  provide                 that only the board of directors, chairman or president may call                 special                 meetings of the shareholders;  establish                 certain advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for                 election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered                 at                 shareholders' meetings;  require                 a vote of the holders of more than two-thirds of the shares entitled                 to                 vote in order to remove a director, change the number of directors,                 or                 amend the foregoing and certain other provisions of the articles                 of                 incorporation and bylaws; and  permit                 the board of directors, without further action of the shareholders,                 to                 issue and fix the terms of preferred stock, which may have rights                 senior                 to those of the common stock.

PROPERTIES Stores As       of       February 3, 2007, we operated 3,219 stores in 48 states as detailed       below: Alabama 81 Maine 16 Ohio 148 Arizona 50 Maryland 74 Oklahoma 50 Arkansas 48 Massachusetts 41 Oregon 65 California 222 Michigan 118 Pennsylvania 178 Colorado 37 Minnesota 39 Rhode                   Island 11 Connecticut 25 Mississippi 49 South                   Carolina 68 Delaware 16 Missouri 80 South                   Dakota 4 Florida 200 Montana 8 Tennessee 83 Georgia 129 Nebraska 11 Texas 200 Idaho 20 Nevada 24 Utah 31 Illinois 134 New                   Hampshire 13 Vermont 6 Indiana 94 New                   Jersey 69 Virginia 125 Iowa 27 New                   Mexico 22 Washington 58 Kansas 31 New                   York 148 West                   Virginia 32 Kentucky 68 North                   Carolina 145 Wisconsin 59 Louisiana 55 North                   Dakota 3 Wyoming 4 We         currently lease our stores and expect to continue to lease new stores as         we         expand. Our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term, generally         five years, with options to extend, however in some cases we have initial         lease         terms of seven to ten years. We believe this leasing strategy enhances our         flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing         market conditions. As current leases expire, we believe that we will be able         to         obtain lease renewals, if desired, for present store locations, or to obtain         leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area.
Distribution         Centers The         following table includes information about the distribution centers that         we         currently operate. We plan to expand the Briar Creek distribution center         in         2007. This expansion will increase the square footage of the Briar Creek         distribution center to 1.0 million square feet. We believe our distribution         center network, including this planned expansion, is capable of supporting         approximately $5.0 billion in annual sales.

With         the         exception of our Salt Lake City and Ridgefield facilities, each of our         distribution centers contains advanced materials handling technologies,         including automated conveyor and sorting systems, radio-frequency inventory         tracking equipment and specialized information systems.

Table         of         Contents 13 Item         3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From         time         to time, we are defendants in ordinary, routine litigation or proceedings         incidental to our business, including allegations regarding:  employment                   related matters;  infringement                   of intellectual property rights;  product                   safety matters, which may include product recalls in cooperation                   with the                   Consumer Products Safety Commission;  personal                   injury/wrongful death claims; and  real                   estate matters related to store                   leases.
In         2003,         we were served with a lawsuit in a California state court by a former employee         who alleged that employees did not properly receive sufficient meal breaks         and         paid rest periods, along with other alleged wage and hourly violations. The         suit         requested that the California state court certify the case as a class action.         This suit was dismissed with prejudice in May 2005, and the dismissal was         appealed. A California appeals court granted the appeal and our petition         for         review to the California Supreme Court was denied. The case has been remanded         to         the trial court where it will likely be consolidated with a companion suit         which         had been filed in the same court following the trial courts earlier dismissal.         We anticipate that the plaintiff will seek class certification which we will         oppose.
In         2005,         we were served with a lawsuit by former employees in Oregon who allege that         they         did not properly receive sufficient meal breaks and paid rest periods. They         also         allege other wage and hour violations. The plaintiffs requested the Court         to         certify classes for their various claims and the presiding judge did so with         respect to two classes, one alleging that our Oregon employees, in violation         of         that states labor laws, were not paid for rest breaks and the other that upon         termination of employment, employees were not tendered their final pay in         a         timely manner. Other claims of the plaintiffs were dismissed by an earlier         Order         of the Court and are being appealed by the plaintiffs. Discovery will ensue         on         the certified class issues; no trial is anticipated before the end of         2007.
In         2006,         we were served with a lawsuit by a former employee in a California state         court         alleging that she was paid for wages with a check drawn on a bank which did         not         have any branches in the state, an alleged violation of the state's labor         code;         that she was paid less for her work than other similar employees with the         same         job title based on her gender; and that we did not pay her final wages in         a         timely manner, also an alleged violation of the labor code. The plaintiff         requested the court to certify the case as a class action. We have been         successful in removing the case from state to the federal court level.
The         parties have reached a settlement and executed an Agreement which will be         presented to the Court for its approval on April 24, 2007. The estimated         settlement amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial         statements as of February 3, 2007.
In         2006,         we were served with a lawsuit filed in federal court in the state of Alabama         by         a former store manager. She claims that she should have been classified as         a         non-exempt employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act and, therefore, should         have received overtime compensation and other benefits. She filed the case         as a         collective action on behalf of herself and all other employees (store managers)         similarly situated. Our motion requesting that the case be transferred from         Alabama to Virginia has been denied. The plaintiff now seeks entry of an         Order         allowing nationwide notice to be sent to all store managers employed by us         now         or within the past three years. We are contesting entry of such an         Order.
We         will         vigorously defend ourselves in these lawsuits. We do not believe that any         of         these matters will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse         effect on our business or financial condition. We cannot give assurance,         however, that one or more of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse         effect on our results of operations for the period in which they are resolved.
Item         4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY         HOLDERS No         matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter         of our 2006 fiscal year.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY,RELATED         STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY         SECURITIES Our         common stock has been traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol "DLTR"         since our initial public offering on March 6, 1995. The following table gives         the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported by Nasdaq for         the         periods indicated.

As of March 30, 2007, we had         approximately 550         shareholders of record.
The         following table presents our share repurchase activity for the 14 weeks ended         February 3, 2007.

During fiscal 2006, we repurchased         5,650,871 shares for approximately $148.2 million under the March 2005         authorization.
In         November 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to         $500.0         million of our common stock. This amount was in addition to the $26.7 million         remaining on the March 2005 authorization. In December 2006, we entered into         two         agreements with a third party to repurchase approximately $100.0 million         of the         Companys common shares under an Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement (ASR).         The $100.0 million is reflected in the table above. As of February 3, 2007,         of         the $100.0 million that is recorded as a reduction to stockholders equity,         approximately $3.8 million is pending final settlement of the ASR. See         additional discussion of the ASR in the Liquidity and Capital Resource section         of, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of         Operations, found elsewhere in this report.
We         anticipate that substantially all of our cash flow from operations in the         foreseeable future will be retained for the development and expansion of         our         business, the repayment of indebtedness and, as authorized by our Board of         Directors, the repurchase of stock. Management does not anticipate paying         dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our         credit         facilities contain financial covenants that restrict our ability to pay cash         dividends.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL           CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In           Managements Discussion and Analysis, we explain the general financial condition           and the results of operations for our company, including:  what                     factors affect our business;  what                     our earnings, gross margins and costs were in 2006 and                     2005;  why                     those earnings, gross margins and costs were different from the                     year                     before;  how                     all of this affects our overall financial condition;  what                     our expenditures for capital projects were in 2006 and what we                     expect them                     to be in 2007; and  where                     funds will come from to pay for future                     expenditures.
As           you           read Managements Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our consolidated           financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which present           the           results of operations for the fiscal years ended February 3, 2007, January           28,           2006 and January 29, 2005. In Managements Discussion and Analysis, we analyze           and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated           financial statements for the fiscal year 2006 compared to the comparable           fiscal           year 2005 and the fiscal year 2005 compared to the comparable fiscal year           2004.
Key           Events and Recent Developments Several           key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our           results           of operations. You should keep in mind that:  In                     November 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase                     of up to                     $500 million of our common stock. This amount was in addition                     to the $26.7                     million remaining on the $300.0 million March 2005 authorization.                     As of                     February 3, 2007, we had approximately $427.0 million remaining                     under this                     authorization.
In                     March 2006, we completed our acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores                     and related                     assets. We paid approximately $32.0 million for store related                     assets and                     $22.1 million forinventory.
On                     December 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of                     Directors                     approved the acceleration of the vesting date of all previously                     issued,                     outstanding and unvested options under all current stock option                     plans,                     effective as of December 15, 2005. This decision eliminated non-cash                     compensation expense that would have been recorded in future                     periods                     following our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards                     No.                     123, Share-Based                     Payment (revised 2004) (FAS                     123R), on January 29, 2006. Compensation expense has been reduced                     by                     approximately $14.9 million over a period of four years during                     which the                     options would have vested, as a result of the option acceleration                     program.
In                     2004, we completed construction and began operations in two new                     distribution centers. In June 2004, we began operations in our                     new                     distribution center in Joliet, Illinois. The Joliet distribution                     center is                     a 1.2 million square foot, fully automated facility. In February                     2004, we                     began operations in our Ridgefield, Washington distribution center.                     The                     Ridgefield distribution center is a 665,000 square foot facility                     that can                     be expanded to accommodate future growth needs. In 2007, we are                     planning                     to expand our Briar Creek distribution center by 400,000 square                     feet. Upon                     completion of this expansion, our nine distribution centers will                     support                     approximately $5.0 billion in sales annually.
In                     March 2004, we entered into a five-year $450.0 million Unsecured                     Revolving                     Credit Facility (Facility). We used availability under this Facility                     to                     repay variable rate debt. This Facility also replaced our previous                     $150.0                     million revolving credit facility.
Overview Our           net           sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend           to affect           our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores or adding           new           stores through acquisitions. Second, sales vary at our existing stores           from one           year to the next. We refer to this change as a change in comparable store           net           sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both           of the           periods being compared. We include sales from stores expanded during the           year in           the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of           increasing our comparable store net sales. The term 'expanded' also includes           stores that are relocated.
Table           of Contents 18 At           February 3, 2007, we operated 3,219 stores in 48 states, with 26.3 million           selling square feet compared to 2,914 stores with 23.0 million selling           square           feet at January 28, 2006. During fiscal 2006, we opened 211 stores, expanded           85           stores and closed 44 stores, compared to 232 new stores opened, 93 stores           expanded and 53 stores closed during fiscal 2005. In addition, we acquired           138           Deal$ stores on March 25, 2006. Including the Deal$ acquisition, we achieved           the           high end of our square footage growth target of 12%-14% for the fiscal           year. In           fiscal 2006, we increased our selling square footage by approximately 3.3           million square feet, or approximately 14%. Of the 3.3 million selling square           foot increase in 2006, approximately 1.2 million resulted from the acquisition           of the Deal$ stores and 0.4 million was added by expanding existing stores.           The           average size of our stores opened in 2006 was approximately 9,000 selling           square           feet (or about 11,000 gross square feet). The average new store size decreased           in 2006 from approximately 10,000 selling square feet (or about 12,400           gross           square feet) for new stores in 2005. For 2007, we continue to plan to open           stores around 9,000 selling square feet (or about 11,000 gross square feet).           We           believe that the 11,000-12,500 gross square foot store size is our optimal           size           operationally and that this size also gives the customer an improved shopping           environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more. We expect the           substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from the square           footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing           stores.
Fiscal           2006 ended on February 3, 2007 and included 53 weeks, commensurate with           the           retail calendar. The 53 rd week in           2006 added approximately $70 million in sales. Fiscal 2005 ended on January           28,           2006 and included 52 weeks.
In           fiscal           2006, comparable store net sales increased by 4.6%. This increase was based           on           53 weeks for both periods. The comparable store net sales increase was           the           result of increases of 1.9% in the number of transactions and 2.7% in           transaction size, compared to fiscal 2005. We believe comparable store           net sales           were positively affected by the initiatives we began putting in place in           2005,           including expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores and the           roll-out           of freezers and coolers to more of our stores. During 2006, we completed           the           roll-out of debit card acceptance to all of our stores, which has enabled           us to           accept Electronic Benefit Transfer cards and we now accept food stamps           in           approximately 600 qualified stores. We believe the expansion of forms of           payment           accepted by our stores has helped increase the average transaction size           in our           stores.
In           2006,           we continued to experience a slight shift in the mix of merchandise sold           to more           consumables, which we believe increases the traffic in our stores but have           lower           margin. The planned shift in mix to more consumables is the result of the           roll-out of freezers and coolers to more stores in 2005 and 2006. At February           3,           2007, we had freezers and coolers in approximately 700 stores, compared           to           approximately 250 stores at January 28, 2006. We plan to add freezers and           coolers to approximately 250 more stores in 2007, which we believe will           continue           to pressure margins, as a percentage of sales, in 2007. However, we believe           that           this will enable us to increase sales and earnings in the future by increasing           the number of shopping trips made by our customers.
Our           point-of-sale technology is now in all of our stores, and this technology           provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our           buyers           and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores. We believe that this           has           enabled us to better control our inventory, resulting in more efficient           distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover. Using           the           data captured at the point of sale has enabled us to better plan our inventory           purchases and helped us reduce our inventory investment per store by           approximately 5.0% at February 3, 2007 compared to January 28, 2006. In           addition, inventory turnover has increased 70 basis points in 2006 as compared           to 2005.
We           must           continue to control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general           and           administrative expenses. Increases in these expenses could negatively impact           our           operating results.
Our           plans           for fiscal 2007 anticipate comparable store net sales increases of approximately           1% to 3% yielding net sales in the $4.22 billion to $4.33 billion range           and           diluted earnings per share of $1.96 to $2.10. This guidance for 2007 is           predicated on selling square footage growth of approximately 10%.
Table           of           Contents 19 On           March           25, 2006, we completed our acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores. These stores           are           located primarily in the Midwest part of the United States and we have           existing           logistics capacity to service these stores. This acquisition also included           a few combo stores that offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items           that sell for more than $1. Substantially all Deal$ stores acquired continue           to           operate under the Deal$ banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage           our           Dollar Tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts,           including           higher price points, without disrupting the single-price point model in           our           Dollar Tree stores. At February 3, 2007, 121 of these stores were selling           items           priced at over $1.00.
We           paid           approximately $32.0 million for store-related and other assets and $22.1           million           forinventory. The results of Deal$ store operations are included in our           financial statements since the acquisition date and did not have a significant           impact on our operating results through February 3, 2007. This acquisition           is           immaterial to our operations as a whole and therefore no proforma disclosure           of           financial information has been presented.
Results           of Operations The           following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations,           as a percentage of net sales: Year                       Ended Year                       Ended Year                       Ended February                       3, January                       28, January                       29, 2007 2006 2005 Net                       sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost                       of sales 65.8 % 65.5 % 64.4 % Gross                       profit 34.2 % 34.5 % 35.6 % Selling,                       general and administrative expenses 26.4 % 26.2 % 26.2 % Operating                       income 7.8 % 8.3 % 9.4 % Interest                       income 0.2 % 0.2 % 0.1 % Interest                       expense (0.4 %) (0.4 %) (0.3 %) Income                       before income taxes 7.6 % 8.1 % 9.2 % Provision                       for income taxes (2.8 %) (3.0 %) (3.4 %) Net                       income 4.8 % 5.1 % 5.8 % Fiscal             year ended February 3, 2007 compared to fiscal year ended January 28,             2006 Net             Sales .             Net             sales increased 16.9%, or $575.5 million, in 2006 compared to 2005, resulting             from sales in our new and expanded stores, including 138 Deal$ stores             acquired             in March 2006 and the 53 weeks of sales in 2006 versus 52 weeks in 2005,             which             accounted for approximately $70 million of the increase. Our sales increase             was             also impacted by a 4.6% increase in comparable store net sales for the             year.             This increase is based on a 53-week comparison for both periods. Comparable             store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated             stores,             which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively             affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing             ones.
The             following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store             count for             fiscal years ended February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006.
February                       3, 2007 January                       28, 2006 New                       stores 190 197 Deal$                       acquisition 138 -- Acquired                       leases 21 35 Expanded                       or relocated stores 85 93 Closed                       stores (44) (53) Table             of Contents 20 Of the 3.3 million selling square foot increase in 2006, approximately             1.2             million resulted from the acquisition of the Deal$ stores and 0.4 million             was             added by expanding existing stores.
Gross             Profit .             Gross             profit margin decreased to 34.2% in 2006 compared to 34.5% in 2005. The             decrease             was primarily due to a 35 basis point increase in merchandise cost, including             inbound freight. This increase in merchandise cost was due to a slight             shift in             mix to more consumables, which have a lower margin, higher cost merchandise             at             our Deal$ stores and increased inbound domestic freight costs.
Selling,             General and Administrative Expenses .             Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net             sales,             increased to 26.4% for 2006 as compared to 26.2% for 2005. The increase             is             primarily due to the following:  Payroll                       and benefit related costs increased 35 basis points due to                       increased                       incentive compensation costs resulting from better overall                       company                       performance in the current year as compared to the prior year                       and                       increased stock compensation expense, partially offset by lower                       workers'                       compensation costs in the current year.
Operating                       and corporate expenses decreased 10 basis points primarily                       as the result                       of payments received for early lease terminations in the current                       year.
Operating             Income .             Due to             the reasons discussed above, operating income margin decreased to 7.8%             in 2006             compared to 8.4% in 2005.
Income             Taxes .             Our             effective tax rate was 36.6% in 2006 compared to 36.8% in 2005. The decreased             tax rate for 2006 was due primarily to increased tax-exempt interest             on certain             of our investments in the current year.
Fiscal             year ended January 28, 2006 compared to fiscal year ended January 29,             2005 Net             Sales .             Net             sales increased 8.6% in 2005 compared to 2004. We attribute this $267.9             million             increase in net sales primarily to new stores in 2005 and 2004 (which             are not             included in our comparable store net sales calculation) partially offset             by a             slight decrease in comparable store net sales of 0.8% in 2005. Our comparable             store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated             stores,             which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively             affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores.
The             following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store             count for             fiscal years ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005.
January                       28, 2006 January                       29, 2005 New                       stores 197 209 Acquired                       leases 35 42 Expanded                       or relocated stores 93 129 Closed                       stores (53) (29) Of             the             2.6 million selling square foot increase in 2005, approximately 0.5 million             in             selling square feet was added by expanding existing stores.
Gross             Profit .             Gross             profit margin decreased to 34.5% in 2005 compared to 35.6% in 2004. The             decrease             is primarily due to the following:  Merchandise                       cost, including inbound freight, increased approximately 55                       basis points,                       due to a slight shift in mix to more consumables, which have                       a lower                       margin and increased inbound freight costs due to higher fuel                       costs.
Occupancy                       costs increased approximately 45 basis points due primarily                       to                       deleveraging associated with the negative comparable store                       net sales for                       the year.
Selling,             General and Administrative Expenses .             Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net             sales, were             26.2% for 2005 and 2004. However, several components had increases or             decreases             as noted below:  Operating                       and corporate expenses decreased approximately 25 basis points                       primarily                       due to decreased store supplies expense as a result of better                       pricing,                       decreased professional fees and the receipt of insurance proceeds                       resulting from a fire at one of our locations, partially offset                       by                       increased interchange fees resulting from the rollout of debit                       card                       acceptancein 2005.
Payroll                       related costs decreased approximately 10 basis points due to                       a reduction                       in incentive compensation accruals that are based on lower                       than budgeted                       2005 earnings and lower workers compensation and health care claims in                       the current year.
These                       decreases were partially offset by an approximate 25 basis                       point increase                       in store operating costs primarily due to higher utility costs                       due to                       higher rates and consumption in the current year.
Depreciation                       expense for stores also increased 10 basis points primarily                       due to the                       deleveraging associated with negative comparable store net                       sales for the                       current year.
Table             of Contents 21 Operating             Income .             Due to             the reasons discussed above, operating income margin decreased to 8.3%             in 2005             compared to 9.4% for 2004.
Interest             Income.
Interest             income increased $2.2 million in 2005 compared to 2004 because of higher             investment balances in the current year and increased interest             rates.
Interest             Expense.
Interest             expense increased $4.8 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. This increase             is             primarily due to increased rates on our revolver in the current year.
Income             Taxes .             Our             effective tax rate was 36.8% in 2005 compared to 37.5% in 2004. The decreased             tax rate for 2005 was due primarily to the resolution of tax uncertainties             in             the current year and increased tax-exempt interest on certain of our             investments.
Liquidity             and Capital Resources Our             business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution             network and operate existing stores. Our working capital requirements             for             existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in September             and             October. Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital             requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and             distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds             and             borrowings under our credit facilities.
The             following table compares cash-related information for the years ended             February             3, 2007, January 28, 2006, and January 29, 2005: Year                       Ended Year                       Ended Year                       Ended February                       3, January                       28, January                       29, (in                       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net                       cash provided by (used in): Operating                       activities $ 412.8 $ 365.1 $ 276.5 Investing                       activities (190.7 ) (235.5 ) (315.4 ) Financing                       activities (202.9 ) (170.3 ) 61.2 The             $47.7             million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was             primarily             due to increased earnings before depreciation in the current year and             better             payables management in the current year, partially offset by approximately             $20.0             million of rent payments for February 2007 made prior to the end offiscal             2006.
The             $44.8             million decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared             to 2005             was the result of a $114.9 million increase in net proceeds from short-term             investments which were used to help fund stock repurchases and the Deal$             acquisition in the current year. In the current year, we purchased an             additional             $9.3 million of investments in a restricted account to collateralize             certain             long-term insurance obligations. Additional uses of cash for investing             activities consisted of $54.1 million for the Deal$ acquisition in the             current             year and an increase of $36.1 million in capital expenditures due primarily             to             new store growth and the installation of freezers and coolers to certain             stores             in the current year.
The             $32.6             million increase in cash used in financing activities in 2006 compared             to 2005             primarily resulted from $248.2 million in stock repurchases in the current             year             compared to $180.4 million in the prior year. This increase was partially             offset             by increased proceeds from stock option exercises in the current year             resulting             from our higher stock prices in 2006 as compared to 2005.
The             $88.6             million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was             primarily             due to an approximate 12% decrease in inventory per store at January             28, 2006             compared to January 29, 2005. The inventory per store decrease is the             result of             an initiative to lower backroom inventory levels and increase inventory             turns             through a reduction in 2005 purchases. The aforementioned net cash provided             by             operating activities was partially offset by a decrease in deferred tax             liabilities chiefly as a result of the elimination of bonus             depreciation.
Table             of             Contents 22 The             $79.9             million decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2005 compared             to 2004             was the result of a $34.2 million decrease in net purchases of investments             resulting from more cash used to repurchase stock in the current year.             The net             purchases of investments in 2005 include $29.9 million of investments             that are             in a restricted account to collateralize certain long-term insurance             obligations. These investments replaced higher cost stand-by letters             of credit             and surety bonds.
Capital             expenditures also decreased $42.5 million in 2005 after two distribution             center             projects and point-of-sale installations were completed in 2004.
The             $231.5 million change in cash used in financing activities in 2005 compared             to             2004 primarily resulted from $180.4 million in stock repurchases in 2005             compared to $48.6 million in 2004. Also in 2004, we entered into a five-year             $450.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, under which we received net             proceeds             of $248.9 million. We used a portion of these proceeds to repay $142.6             million             of variable rate debt for our distribution centers and invested the balance             in             short-term tax exempt municipal bonds.
At             February 3, 2007, our long-term borrowings were $268.8 million and our             capital             lease commitments were $0.7 million. We also have $125.0 million and             $50.0             million Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreements, under             which             approximately $84.8 million were committed to letters of credit issued             for             routine purchases of imported merchandise at February 3, 2007.
In             March             2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0             million             of our common stock through March 2008. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased             5,650,871 shares for approximately $148.2 million under the March 2005             authorization.
In             November 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up             to $500.0             million of our common stock. This amount was in addition to the $27.0             million             remaining on the March 2005 authorization. In December 2006, we entered             into two             agreements with a third party to repurchase approximately $100.0 million             of the             Companys common shares under an Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement             (ASR).
The             first             $50.0 million was executed in an uncollared agreement. In this transaction, we             initially received 1,656,178 shares based on the market price of our             stock of             $30.19 as of the trade date (December 8, 2006). A weighted average price             was             calculated using stock prices from December 16, 2006 - March 8, 2007.             This             represents the calculation period and based on the weighted average price             during             this period, a settlementtook placein March2007 resulting in             additional funding of $3.3 million.
The             remaining $50.0 million relates to a collared agreement in which we initially             received 1,500,703 shares representing the minimum number of shares under             the             agreement. The maximum number of shares that can be repurchased under             the             agreement is 1,693,101. The number of shareswas determined based on the             weighted average market price of our common stock during the same calculation             period as defined in the uncollared agreement. The weighted average market             price as of February 3, 2007 as defined in the collared agreement was $30.80.             Therefore, as of February 3, 2007, we would receive an additional 122,742             shares             under the collared agreement. Based on the applicable accounting literature,             these additional shares were not included in the weighted average diluted             earnings per share calculation because their effect would be antidilutive.             The             weighted average stock price of our common stock as defined in the collared agreement as of March 8, 2007 (termination date) was $31.97. We received             an             additional 63,325 shares on March 8, 2007 under this agreement.
On             March 29, 2007, we entered into an agreement with a             third party to repurchase approximately $150.0 million of our common             shares             under another ASR. The entire $150.0 million was executed under a             "collared" agreement.
Within             two weeks of the March 29, 2007 execution date, we will receive the minimum             number of shares. Up to four months after the initial execution date,             we will             receive additional shares from the third party depending on the volume             weighted             average price of our common shares during that period, subject to the             maximum             share delivery provisions of the agreement.
Table             of Contents 23 Funding             Requirements Overview We             expect             our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in             fiscal             2007 to total approximately $160.7 million,             which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening             costs.             Our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 are between $170.0             and $190.0             million, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores,             the             addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 250 stores, an expansion             of             the Briar Creek Distribution Center and an expansion to our home office             and data             center in Chesapeake, Va. We believe that we can adequately fund our             working             capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few             years             from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our             existing             credit facilities.
The             following tables summarize our material contractual obligations, including             both             on- and off-balance sheet arrangements, and our commitments, excluding             interest             on long-term borrowings (in millions): Contractual                       Obligations Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Lease                       Financing Operating                       lease obligations $ 1,177.0 $ 284.2 $ 246.0 $ 207.2 $ 161.5 $ 110.6 $ 167.5 Capital                       lease obligations 0.8 0.4 0.3 0.1 -- -- -- Long-term                       Borrowings Revolving                       credit facility 250.0 -- -- 250.0 -- -- -- Revenue                       bond financing 18.8 18.8 -- -- -- -- -- Total                       obligations $ 1,446.6 $ 303.4 $ 246.3 $ 457.3 $ 161.5 $ 110.6 $ 167.5 Commitments Total Expiring                       in 2007 Expiring                       in 2008 Expiring                       in 2009 Expiring                       in 2010 Expiring                       in 2011 Thereafter Letters                       of credit and surety bonds $ 116.3 $ 115.6 $ 0.7 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- Freight                       contracts 57.1 38.6 9.9 8.6 -- -- -- Technology                       assets 3.8 3.8 -- -- -- -- -- Total                       commitments $ 177.2 $ 158.0 $ 10.6 $ 8.6 $ -- $ -- $ -- Lease             Financing Operating             Lease Obligations.
Our             operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable             store             leases. The commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior             to             February 3, 2007 for stores that were not yet open on February 3,             2007.
Capital             Lease Obligations .             Our             capital lease obligations are primarily for payments for distribution             center             equipment and computer equipment at the store support center.
Long-Term             Borrowings Revolving             Credit Facility.
In             March             2004, we entered into a five-year Revolving Credit Facility (the Facility).             The             Facility provides for a $450.0 million line of credit, including up to             $50.0             million in available letters of credit. Interest is assessed under the             line based on matrix pricing which currently approximates LIBOR, plus             0.475%.             The Facility, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain             specified             financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and             prohibits             the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. We used availability under             this             Facility to repay the $142.6 million of variable-rate debt and to purchase             short-term investments. As of February 3, 2007, we had $250.0 million             outstanding on this Facility.
Table             of             Contents 24 Revenue             Bond Financing .             In May             1998, we entered into an agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance             Corporation under which it issued $19.0 million of variable-rate demand             revenue             bonds. We used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition,             construction and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment             for             our distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. At February 3,             2007, the             balance outstanding on the bonds was $18.8 million. These bonds are due             to be             fully repaid in June 2018. The bonds do not have a prepayment penalty             as long as             the interest rate remains variable. The bonds contain a demand provision             and,             therefore, outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities.             We pay             interest monthly based on a variable interest rate, which was 5.4% at             February             3, 2007.
Commitments Letters             of Credit and Surety Bonds .             In             March 2001, we entered into a Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security             Agreement, which provides $125.0 million for letters of credit. In December             2004, we entered into an additional Letter of Credit Reimbursement and             Security             Agreement, which provides $50.0 million for letters of credit. Letters             of credit             are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise             and we had             approximately $84.8 million of purchases committed under these letters             of credit             at February 3, 2007. We also have approximately $31.5 million of letters             of             credit or surety bonds outstanding for our insurance programs and certain             utility payment obligations at some of our stores.
Freight             Contracts.
We have             contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts             expiring through April 2009. The total amount of these commitments is             approximately $57.1 million.
Technology             Assets.
We have             commitments totaling approximately $3.8 million to primarily purchase             store             technology assets for our stores during 2007.
Derivative             Financial Instruments We             are             party to one interest rate swap, which allows us to manage the risk associated             with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds. The swap             is based             on a notional amount of $18.8 million. Under the $18.8 million agreement,             as             amended, we pay interest to the bank that provided the swap at a fixed             rate. In             exchange, the financial institution pays us at a variable-interest rate,             which             is similar to the rate on the demand revenue bonds. The variable-interest             rate             on the interest rate swap is set monthly. No payments are made by either             party             under the swap for monthly periods with an established interest rate             greater             than a predetermined rate (the knock-out rate). The swap may be canceled             by the             bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by             market             rates and expires in 2009.
Because             of the knock-out provision in the $18.8 million swap, changes in the             fair value             of that swap are recorded in earnings. For more information on the interest             rate             swaps, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk             -             Interest Rate Risk." Critical             Accounting Policies The             preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. Certain             of             our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential             to have a             material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary             significantly from             those estimates. Following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider             critical.
Inventory             Valuation As             discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, inventories             at the             distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost             determined on a weighted-average basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories             using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis. Under             the retail             inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting             gross             margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to             the retail             value of inventories. The retail inventory method is an averaging method             that             has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories             at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of             the retail             value of inventories on a timely basis.
Inventory             valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and             judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink,             which             significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as             the             resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail             inventory             method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain             circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper             period.
We             estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety             of             factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or             seasonal,             carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future             merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by             many             factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes             in economic             conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced             significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared             with             actual results.
Table             of             Contents 25 Our             accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results             of our most             recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic             conditions. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical             inventory             counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Our physical inventory             counts are generally taken between January and September of each year;             therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at February 3, 2007 is based on             estimated             shrink for most of 2006, including the fourth quarter. We have not experienced             significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond 10 to 15 basis             points             in our Dollar Tree stores for the last two years. However, we have sometimes             experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year             following             an acquisition. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address             these             factors as they become apparent.
Our             management believes that our application of the retail inventory method             results             in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results             in             carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent             basis.
Accrued             Expenses On             a             monthly basis, we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those             expenses in the period incurred. Our most material estimates include             domestic             freight expenses, self-insurance programs, store-level operating expenses,             such             as property taxes and utilities, and certain other expenses. Our freight             and             store-level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity             and             historical trends and results. Our workers' compensation and general             liability             insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are             adjusted             annually based on a review performed by a third-party actuary. These             actuarial             valuations are estimates based on historical loss development factors.             Certain             other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management             becomes             aware of them. The related accruals are adjusted as managements estimates             change. Differences in management's estimates and assumptions could result             in an             accrual materially different from the calculated accrual. Our experience             has             been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low.             Historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material             effect             on our financial condition or results of operations.
Income             Taxes On             a             quarterly basis, we estimate our required income tax liability and assess             the             recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our income taxes payable are             estimated based on enacted tax rates, including estimated tax rates in             states             where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be             taxed             currently. The current tax liability also includes a liability for resolution             of             tax uncertainties. Management assesses the recoverability of deferred             tax assets             based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts             and             managements projections for future taxable income. We cannot guarantee that we             will generate taxable income in future years. Historically, we have not             experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual.             In 2006             and 2005, we recognized approximately $0.7 million and $1.5 million,             respectively, of tax benefits related to the resolution of tax uncertainties             in             certain states.
Seasonality               and Quarterly Fluctuations We               experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store               net sales,               operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue.               Our results               of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety               of               factors, including:  shifts                       in the timing of certain holidays, especially Easter;  the                       timing of new store openings;  the                       net sales contributed by new stores;  changes                       in our merchandise mix; and  competition.
Our             highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons. Easter was             observed             on March 27, 2005, April 16, 2006 and will be observed on April 8, 2007.             We             generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our             operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation of             increased             sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of             inventory             and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our             continuing store staff. Our operating results, particularly operating             and net             income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during             the             fourth quarter or during the Easter season for any reason, including             merchandise             delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems or consumer             sentiment.             Fiscal 2006 consisted of 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar.             This             extra week contributed approximately $70.0 million of sales in 2006.             Fiscal 2007             will consist of 52 weeks.
Table             of Contents 26 Our             unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are             shown in             a table in Footnote 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item             8 of             this Form 10-K.
Inflation             and Other Economic Factors Our             ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable             basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot             control.             Consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures, including             rising             fuel prices. Reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have             an             adverse effect on our sales. National or international events, including             war or             terrorism, could lead to disruptions in economies in the United States             or in             foreign countries where we purchase some of our merchandise. These and             other             factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are             critical             to our operations, such as shipping and wage rates.
Shipping             Costs .             Currently, trans-Pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual             freight             lines and are subject to fluctuation based on supply and demand for containers             and current fuel costs. As a result, our trans-Pacific shipping costs in             fiscal 2007 may increase compared with fiscal 2006 when we renegotiate             our             import shipping rates effective May 2007. We can give no assurances as             to the             amount of the increase, as we are in the early stages of our negotiations.
Minimum             Wage.
Although             our average hourly wage rate is significantly higher than the federal             minimum             wage, an increase in the mandated minimum wage couldincrease our payroll             costs. In early 2007, proposals increasing the federal minimum wage to             $7.25 per             hour over a three-year period have passed both houses of Congress. If             the             federal minimum wage were to increase over the next three years to $7.25             per             hour, we believe that it would not have a material effect on our annual             payroll             expenses.
New             Accounting Pronouncements In             July             2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation             No. 48 ("FIN 48"), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an             interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 . FIN 48 clarifies the accounting             for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial             statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income             Taxes . FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute             for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position             taken             or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance             on             derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in             interim             periods, disclosures, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal             years             beginning after December 15, 2006. We do not expect that the adoption             of FIN 48             will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results             of             operations or cash flows.
Item             7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT             MARKET RISK We             are             exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business,             including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency rate             fluctuations. We may enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure             to             interest rate changes, and we may employ other risk management strategies,             including the use of foreign currency forward contracts. We do not enter             into             derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging purposes             and             we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes.
Interest             Rate Risk We             use             variable-rate debt to finance certain of our operations and capital             improvements. These obligations expose us to variability in interest             payments             due to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest             expense             increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense also             decreases. We believe it is beneficial to limit the variability of our             interest             payments.
To               meet               this objective, we entered into a derivative instrument in the form               of an               interest rate swap to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from               changes               in the variable-interest rates on the Demand Revenue Bonds. The interest               rate               swap reduces the interest rate exposure on this variable-rate obligation.               Under               the interest rate swap, we pay the bank at a fixed-rate and receive               variable-interest at a rate approximating the variable-rate on the               obligation,               thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed-rate obligation.               Under the               swap, no payments are made by parties under the swap for monthly periods               in               which the variable-interest rate is greater than the predetermined               knock-out               rate.
Table               of Contents 27 The             following table summarizes the financial terms of our interest rate swap             agreement and the fair value of the interest rate swap at February 3,             2007: Hedging Instrument Receive                       Variable Pay Fixed Knock-out Rate Expiration Fair Value $18.8                       million interest                       rate swap LIBOR 4.88% 7.75% 4/1/09 -- At             February 3, 2007, the fair value of this interest rate swap is less than             $0.1             million. Hypothetically, a 1% change in interest rates results in approximately             a $0.2 million change in the amount paid or received under the terms             of the             interest rate swap agreement on an annual basis. Due to many factors,             management             is not able to predict the changes in fair value of our interest rate             swap. The             fair values are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate             the             agreement as of the reporting date.

An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used         and         significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall         financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a         reasonable basis for our opinion.

The Company's stores are located in all 48 contiguous states.             The             Company's merchandise includes food, health and beauty care, party goods,             candy,toys, stationery, seasonal goods, gifts and other consumer items.             Approximately 35% to 40% of the Company's merchandise is imported, primarily             from China.
Principles             of Consolidation The             consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of             Dollar             Tree Stores, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant             intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal             Year The             Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Any             reference             herein to 2006 or Fiscal 2006, 2005 or Fiscal 2005, and 2004 or Fiscal 2004 relates to as of or for the years ended February 3, 2007, January             28, 2006, and January 29, 2005, respectively. Fiscal year 2006 consisted             of 53             weeks, while 2005 and 2004 both consisted of 52 weeks.
Use             of Estimates The             preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally             accepted             accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions             that             affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures             of             contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial             statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the             reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications Certain             2005 and 2004 amounts have been reclassified for comparability with the             current             period presentation.
Cash             and Cash Equivalents Cash             and             cash equivalents at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 includes $40.3             million             and $31.4 million, respectively, of investments in money market securities             and             bank participation agreements which are valued at cost, which approximates             market. The underlying assets of these short-term participation agreements             are             primarily commercial notes. For purposes of the consolidated statements             of cash             flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with             original             maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The majority             of             payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of debit             card and             credit card transactions process within three business days, and therefore             are             classified as cash and cash equivalents.
Short-Term             Investments The             Companys short-term investments consist primarily of government-sponsored             municipal bonds and auction rate securities. These investments are classified             as             available for sale and are recorded at fair value, which approximates             cost. The             government-sponsored municipal bonds can be converted into cash depending             on             terms of the underlying agreement. The auction rate securities have stated             interest rates, which typically reset to prevailing market rates every             35 days             or less. The securities underlying both the government-sponsored municipal             bonds             and the auction rate securities have longer legal maturity dates.
Merchandise             Inventories Merchandise             inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost             or             market, determined on a weighted average cost basis. Cost is assigned             to store             inventories using the retail inventory method, determined on a weighted             average             cost basis.
Costs             directly associated with warehousing and distribution are capitalized             as             merchandise inventories. Total warehousing and distribution costs capitalized             into inventory amounted to $25.6 million and $25.3 million at February             3, 2007             and January 28, 2006, respectively.
35 Property,             Plant and Equipment Property,             plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line             method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as             follows: Buildings 40                       years Furniture,                       fixtures and equipment 3                       to 15 years Transportation                       vehicles 4                       to 6 years Leasehold             improvements and assets held under capital leases are amortized over             the             estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the committed terms             of the             related leases, whichever is shorter. Amortization is included in "selling,             general and administrative expenses" on the accompanying consolidated             statements             of operations.
In             the             fourth quarter of 2004, the Company revised its estimate of useful lives             on             certain store equipment and distribution center assets. This change increased             net income by approximately $4.0 million in the first three quarters             of 2005 as             compared to 2004.
Costs             incurred related to software developed for internal use are capitalized             and             amortized over three years. Costs capitalized include those incurred             in the             application development stage as defined in Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting             for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal             Use .
Impairment             of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed             Of The             Company reviews its long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible             assets             for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that             the             carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, in accordance with             Statement             of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting             for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets .             Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing             the             carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected             to be             generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired,             the             impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying             amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets based on discounted             cash flows or other readily available evidence of fair value, if any.             Assets to             be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair             value             less costs to sell. In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded             charges             of $0.5 million, $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, to write             down             certain assets. These charges are recorded as a component of "selling,             general             and administrative expenses" in the accompanying consolidated statements             of             operations.
Intangible             Assets Goodwill             and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized,             but rather             tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with finite             useful             lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and             reviewed             for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The Company performs             its annual             assessment of impairment following the finalization of each Novembers financial             statements.
Financial             Instruments The             Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure             to             market risks from changes in interest rates. By entering into receive-variable,             pay-fixed interest rate swaps, the Company limits its exposure to changes             in             variable interest rates. The Company is exposed to credit-related losses             in the             event of non-performance by the counterparty to the interest rate swaps;             however, the counterparties are major financial institutions, and the             risk of             loss due to non-performance is considered remote. Interest rate differentials             paid or received on the swaps are recognized as adjustments to expense             in the             period earned or incurred. The Company formally documents all hedging             relationships, if applicable, and assesses hedge effectiveness both at             inception             and on an ongoing basis.
Certain             of the Companys interest rate swaps have not qualified for hedge accounting             treatment pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting             for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133) .             These             interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value in the accompanying consolidated             balance sheets as a component of other liabilities (see Note 6). Changes in             the fair values of these interest rate swaps are recorded as "interest             expense and change in the fair value of non-hedging interest rate swaps" in the             accompanying consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated             statements of cash flows, respectively.
36 Lease             Accounting The             Company recognized a one-time non-cash, after-tax adjustment of $5.7             million, or             $0.05 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2004 to reflect the             cumulative             impact of a correction of its accounting practices related to leased             properties.             Of the aforementioned amount, approximately $1.2 million, or $0.01 per             diluted             share, related to fiscal 2004. Consistent with industry practices, in             prior             periods, the Company had reported its straight line expenses for leases             beginning on the earlier of the store opening date or the commencement             date of             the lease. This had the effect of excluding the pre-opening or build-out             period             of its stores (generally 60 days) from the calculation of the period             over which             it expenses rent. In addition, amounts received as tenant allowances             were             reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction to store leasehold improvement             costs instead of being classified as deferred lease credits. The adjustment             made             to correct these practices does not affect historical or future net cash             flows             or the timing of payments under related leases. Rather, this change affected             the             classification of costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of             operations             and cash flows by increasing depreciation and decreasing rent expense,             which is             included in cost of sales. In addition, fixed assets and deferred liabilities             increased due to the net cumulative unamortized allowances and abatements.
Revenue             Recognition The             Company recognizes sales revenue at the time a sale is made to its             customer.
Taxes             Collected The             Company reports taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly             imposed on revenue-producing transactions (i.e., sales tax) on a net             (excluded             from revenues) basis.
Cost             of Sales The             Company includes the cost of merchandise, warehousing and distribution             costs,             and certain occupancy costs in cost of sales.
Pre-Opening             Costs The             Company expenses pre-opening costs for new, expanded and relocated stores,             as             incurred.
Advertising             Costs The             Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred. Advertising             costs             approximated $10.6 million, $11.8 million and $11.0 million for the years             ended             February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006, and January 29, 2005,             respectively.
Income             Taxes Income             taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred             tax             assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences             attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts             of             existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred             tax             assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected             to apply to             taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are             expected to             be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities             of a             change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes             the             enactment date of such change.
Stock-Based             Compensation Effective,             January 29, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting             Standards, No. 123(revised 2004), Share-Based Payment , (SFAS 123R).             This statement is a revision of SFAS 123 and supersedes Accounting Principle             Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , (APB             Opinion 25). SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees,             including             grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements             based on their fair values. The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified             prospective method, which requires application of the standard to all             awards             granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled on or after January 29, 2006,             and to             all awards granted to employees that were unvested as of January 29,             2006. In             accordance with the modified prospective method of implementation, prior             period             financial statements have not been restated to reflect the impact of             SFAS 123R.             During 2006, the Company recognized $1.8 million of stock-based compensation             expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R. Total stock-based compensation             expense for 2006 and 2005 was $6.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively.             There             was no stock-based compensation expense for 2004. Through January 28,             2006, the             Company applied the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles             of             APB Opinion 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock-based             employee compensation plans. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the             Company             reported all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options             as             operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. SFAS             123R             requires cash flows resulting from the tax deductions in excess of the             tax             benefits of the related compensation cost recognized in the financial             statements             (excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. Thus,             the             Company has classified the $5.6 million of excess tax benefits recognized             in             2006 as financing cash flows. Excess tax benefits of $1.2 million and             $2.1             million recognized in 2005 and 2004, respectively, prior to the adoption             of SFAS             123R, are classified as operating cash flows.
37 If             the accounting provisions of SFAS 123 had been applied to 2005 and 2004,             the Company's net income and net income per share would have been reduced             to the             pro forma amounts indicated in the following table: Year                       Ended Year                       Ended January                       28, January                       29, (in                       millions, except per share data) 2006 2005 Net                       income as reported $ 173.9 $ 180.3 Add:                       Total stock-based employee compensation                       expense included in net income,                       net of related tax effects 1.5 - Deduct:                       Total stock-based employee compensation                       expense determined under fair                       value based method, net                       of related tax effects (18.2 ) (13.0 ) $ 157.2 $ 167.3 Net                       income per share: Basic,                       as reported $ 1.61 $ 1.59 Basic,                       pro forma under FAS 123 1.45 1.48 Diluted,                       as reported $ 1.60 $ 1.58 Diluted,                       pro forma under FAS 123 1.44 1.47 On               December 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors               of the               Company approved the acceleration of the vesting date of all previously               issued,               outstanding and unvested options under all current stock option plans,               including               the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan and the               2004               Executive Officer Equity Incentive Plan (EOEP), effective as of December               15,               2005. At the effective date, almost all of these options had exercise               prices               higher than the actual stock price. The Company made the decision to               accelerate               vesting of these options to give employees increased performance incentives               and               to enhance current retention. This decision also eliminated non-cash               compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods               following               the Companys adoption of SFAS 123R on January 29, 2006. Compensation expense,               as determined at the time of the accelerated vesting, has been reduced               by $14.9               million, over a period of four years during which the options would               have vested,               as a result of the option acceleration program. This amount is net               of               compensation expense of $0.1 million recognized in fiscal 2005 for               estimated               forfeiture of certain (in the money) options.
The               Company recognizes expense related to the fair value of restricted               stock units               (RSUs) over the requisite service period. The fair value of the RSUs               is               determined using the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of               grant.
On               March               30, 2007, the Board of Directors granted approximately 0.3 million               restricted               stock units and options to purchase 0.4 million shares of the Companys common               stock under the Companys Equity Incentive Plan and the EOEP.
Net               Income Per Share Basic               net               income per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted               average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share               reflects the               potential dilution that could occur assuming the inclusion of dilutive               potential               shares and has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted               average               number of shares and dilutive potential shares outstanding. Dilutive               potential               shares include all outstanding stock options and unvested restricted               stock,               excluding certain performance based restricted stock grants, after               applying the               treasury stock method.

These assets are being amortized             over             the legal term of the individual agreements, ranging from five to ten             years.
Favorable             Lease Rights In             2006             and 2005, the Company acquired favorable lease rights for operating leases             for             retail locations from third parties, including the acquired favorable             lease             rights in its acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores (see Note 10). The Companys             favorable lease rights are amortized on a straight-line basis to rent             expense             over the remaining initial lease terms, which expire at various dates             through             2016. The weighted average life remaining on the favorable lease rights             at             February 3, 2007 is 54 months.
Amortization             expense related to the non-competition agreements and favorable lease             rights was             $4.4 million, $3.3 million and $1.6 million for the years ended February             3,             2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively. Estimated             annual             amortization expense for the next five years follows: 2007 - $4.8 million;             2008             - $3.4 million; 2009 - $1.8 million, 2010 - $1.2 million, and 2011 -             $0.7             million.
Goodwill In             accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer being amortized,             but is             tested annually for impairment. In addition, goodwill will be tested             on an             interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely             than             not that an impairment loss has been incurred. The Company performed             its annual             impairment testing in November 2006 and determined that no impairment             loss             existed.
39 Property,             Plant and Equipment, Net Property,             plant and equipment, net, as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006             consists             of the following: February                       3, January                       28, (in                       millions) 2007 2006 Land $ 29.4 $ 29.4 Buildings 154.7 154.7 Improvements 482.3 418.1 Furniture,                       fixtures and equipment 708.6 608.4 Construction                       in progress 38.3 29.3 Total                       property, plant and equipment 1,413.3 1,239.9 Less:                       accumulated depreciation and amortization 698.0 558.1 Total                       property, plant and equipment, net $ 715.3 $ 681.8 Other               Assets, Net Other               assets, net includes $39.2 million of restricted investments. The Company               purchased these restricted investments to collateralize long-term insurance               obligations. These investments replaced higher cost stand by letters               of credit               and surety bonds. These investments consist primarily of government-sponsored               municipal bonds and auction rate securities, similar to our short-term               investments. These investments are classified as available for sale               and are               recorded at fair value, which approximates cost.
Other               Current Liabilities Other               current liabilities as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 consist               of               accrued expenses for the following: February                       3, January                       28, (in                       millions) 2007 2006 Compensation                       and benefits $ 43.5 $ 22.2 Taxes                       (other than income taxes) 19.5 15.8 Insurance 26.8 28.1 Other 42.2 33.1 Total                       other current liabilities $ 132.0 $ 99.2 Fair             Value of Financial Instruments The             carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, other current assets, accounts             payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value because             of the             short maturity of these instruments. The carrying values of other long-term             financial assets and liabilities, excluding restricted investments, approximate             fair value because they are recorded using discounted future cash flows             or             quoted market rates. Short-term investments and restricted investments             are             carried at fair value, which approximates cost, in accordance with SFAS             No. 115, Accounting             for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities .
The             carrying value of the Company's long-term debt approximates its fair             value             because the debts interest rates vary with market interest rates.
It             is not             practicable to estimate the fair value of the Companys outstanding commitments             for letters of credit and surety bonds without             unreasonable cost.

41 Deferred               income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between               the               carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting               purposes and               the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities               are classified on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based               on the               classification of the underlying asset or liability. Significant components               of               the Company's net deferred tax assets (liabilities) follows: February                           3, January                           28, 2007 2006 Deferred                           tax assets: Accrued                           expenses $ 33.5 $ 30.6 State                           tax net operating losses and credit carryforwards, net                           of federal tax benefit 1.3 - Accrued                           compensation expense 9.3 1.0 Valuation                           allowance (1.3 ) - Total                           deferred tax assets 42.8 31.6 Deferred                           tax liabilities: Intangible                           assets (9.2 ) (8.0 ) Property                           and equipment (14.3 ) (34.9 ) Prepaids (9.0 ) (1.2 ) Other (1.1 ) (0.2 ) Total                           deferred tax liabilities (33.6 ) (44.3 ) Net                           deferred tax asset (liability) $ 9.2 $ (12.7 ) A                 valuation allowance of $1.3 million, net of Federal tax benefits,                 has been                 provided principally for certain state net operating losses andcredit                 carryforwards.In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,                 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some                 portion or all                 of the deferred taxes will not be realized. Based upon the availability                 of                 carrybacks of future deductible amounts to the past two years taxable income                 and management's projections for future taxable income over the periods                 in which                 the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is                 more likely                 than not the remaining existing deductible temporary differences                 will reverse                 during periods in which carrybacks are available or in which the                 Company                 generates net taxable income.
During                 2006, the Company concluded an examination with the Internal Revenue                 Service                 (IRS) for calendar year 1999 through fiscal year 2003. The results                 of the                 examination were immaterial to the financial statements. Fiscal year                 2004 and                 forward are open for examination by the IRS. In addition, several                 years are open                 to state income tax audits. Management believes that adequate provisions                 have                 been made for any additional taxes and interest thereon that might                 arise as a                 result of future IRS and state examinations related to these open                 years.
NOTE                 4 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating                 Lease Commitments Future                 minimum lease payments under noncancelable stores and distribution                 center                 operating leases are as follows: 2007 $ 284.2 2008 246.0 2009 207.2 2010 161.5 2011 110.6 Thereafter 167.5 Total                           minimum lease payments $ 1,177.0 42 The above future minimum lease payments include amounts for leases                   that were                   signed prior to February 3, 2007 for stores that were not open                   as of February 3,                   2007.
Minimum                   rental payments for operating leases do not include contingent                   rentals that may                   be paid under certain store leases based on a percentage of sales                   in excess of                   stipulated amounts. Future minimum lease payments have not been                   reduced by                   expected future minimum sublease rentals of $2.3 million under                   operating                   leases.
Minimum                   and Contingent Rentals Rental                   expense for store and distribution center operating leases (including                   payments                   to related parties) included in the accompanying consolidated statements                   of                   operations are as follows: Year                               Ended Year                               Ended Year                               Ended February                               3, January                               28, January                               29, 2007 2006 2005 Minimum                               rentals $ 261.8 $ 225.8 $ 200.7 Contingent                               rentals 0.9 0.7 0.9 Non-Operating                     Facilities The                     Company is responsible for payments under leases for certain                     closed stores. The                     Company was also responsible for payments under leases for two                     former                     distribution centers whose leases expired in June 2005 and September                     2005. The                     Company accounts for abandoned lease facilities in accordance                     with SFAS No. 146, Accounting                     for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities .                     A                     facility is considered abandoned on the date that the Company                     ceases to use it.                     On this date, the Company records an expense for the present                     value of the total                     remaining costs for the abandoned facility reduced by any actual                     or probable                     sublease income. Due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate                     recovery of the                     future lease and related payments, the Company recorded charges                     of $0.1 million,                     $0.3 million and $1.5 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Related                     Parties The                     Company also leases properties for six of its stores from partnerships                     owned by                     related parties. The total rental payments related to these leases                     were $0.5                     million for each of the years ended February 3, 2007, January                     28, 2006, and                     January 29, 2005, respectively. Total future commitments under                     related party                     leases are $1.4 million.
Freight                     Services The                     Company has contracted outbound freight services from various                     contract carriers                     with contracts expiring through January 2010. The total amount                     of these                     commitments is approximately $57.1 million, of which approximately                     $38.6 million                     is committed in 2007, $9.9 million is committed in 2008 and $8.6                     million is                     committed in 2009.
Technology                     Assets The                     Company has commitments totaling approximately $3.8 million to                     purchase store                     technology assets for its stores during 2007.
Letters                     of Credit In                     March                     2001, the Company entered into a Letter of Credit Reimbursement                     and Security                     Agreement. The agreement provides $125.0 million for letters                     of credit. In                     December 2004, the Company entered into an additional Letter                     of Credit                     Reimbursement and Security Agreement, which provides $50.0 million                     for letters                     of credit. Letters of credit under both of these agreements are                     generally issued                     for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and approximately                     $84.8 million                     was committed to these letters of credit at February 3, 2007.
The                     Company also has approximately $29.4 million in stand-by letters                     of credit that                     serve as collateral for its high-deductible insurance programs                     and expire in                     fiscal 2007.
Surety                     Bonds The                     Company has issued various surety bonds that primarily serve                     as collateral for                     utility payments at the Companys stores. The total amount of the commitment is                     approximately $2.1 million, which is committed through various                     dates through                     fiscal 2008.
43 Contingencies In                     2003,                     the Company was served with a lawsuit in a California state court                     by a former                     employee who alleged that employees did not properly receive                     sufficient meal                     breaks and paid rest periods, along with other alleged wage and                     hourly                     violations. The suit requested that the California state court                     certify the case                     as a class action. This suit was dismissed with prejudice in                     May 2005, and the                     dismissal was appealed. A California appeals court granted the                     appeal and the                     Company's petition for review to the California Supreme Court                     was denied. The                     case has been remanded to the trial court's where it will likely                     be consolidated                     with a companion suit which had been filed in the same court                     following the trial                     courts earlier dismissal. It is anticipated that the plaintiff                     will seek class                     certification which the Company will oppose.
In                     2005,                     the Company was served with a lawsuit by former employees in                     Oregon who allege                     that they did not properly receive sufficient meal breaks and                     paid rest periods.                     They also allege other wage and hour violations. The plaintiffs                     requested the                     Court to certify classes for their various claims and the presiding                     judge                     recently did so with respect to two classes, one alleging that                     our Oregon                     employees, in violation of that states labor laws, were not paid for rest                     breaks and the other that upon termination of employment, employees                     were not                     tendered their final pay in a timely manner. Other claims of                     the plaintiffs were                     dismissed by an earlier Order of the Court and are being appealed                     by the                     plaintiffs. Discovery will ensue on the certified class issues;                     no trial is                     anticipated before the end of 2007.
In                     2006,                     the Company was served with a lawsuit by a former employee in                     a California state                     court alleging that she was paid for wages with a check drawn                     on a bank which                     did not have any branches in the state, an alleged violation                     of the state's                     labor code; that she was paid less for her work than other similar                     employees                     with the same job title based on her gender; and that we did                     not pay her final                     wages in a timely manner, also an alleged violation of the labor                     code. The                     plaintiff requested the court to certify the case as a class                     action. The Company                     has been successful in removing the case from state to the federal                     court                     level.
The                     parties have reached a settlement and executed an Agreement which                     will be                     presented to the Court for its approval on April 24, 2007. The                     estimated has                     been accrued in theaccompanying financial statements as ofFebruary                     3, 2007.
In                     2006,                     the Company was served with a lawsuit filed in federal court                     in the state of                     Alabama by a former store manager. She claims that she should                     have been                     classified as a non-exempt employee under the Fair Labor Standards                     Act and,                     therefore, should have received overtime compensation and other                     benefits. She                     filed the case as a collective action on behalf of herself and                     all other                     employees (store managers) similarly situated. The Companys motion requesting                     that the case be transferred from Alabama to Virginiawas denied. The                     plaintiff now seeks entry of an Order allowing nationwide notice                     be sent to all                     store managers employed by the Company now or within the past                     three years. The                     Company is contesting entry of such an Order.
The                     Company will vigorously defend itself in these lawsuits. The                     Company does not                     believe that any of these matters will, individually or in the                     aggregate, have a                     material adverse effect on its business or financial condition.                     The Company                     cannot give assurance, however, that one or more of these lawsuits                     will not have                     a material adverse effect on its results of operations for the                     period in which                     they are resolved.
44 NOTE                     5 - LONG-TERM DEBT Long-term                     debt at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 consists of the                     following: February                                 3, January                                 28, (in                                 millions) 2007 2006 $450.0                                 million Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, interest                                 payable monthly at LIBOR, plus                                 0.475%, which was 5.8% at February                                 3, 2007, principal payable upon expiration                                 of the facility in March 2009 $ 250.0 $ 250.0 Demand                                 Revenue Bonds, interest payable monthly at                                 a variable rate which was 5.4% at February                                 3, 2007, principal payable on demand,                                 maturing June 2018 18.8 19.0 Total                                 long-term debt 268.8 269.0 Less                                 current portion 18.8 19.0 Long-term                                 debt, excluding current portion $ 250.0 $ 250.0 Maturities                     of long-term debt are as follows: 2007 - $18.8 million and 2009                     - $250.0                     million.
Unsecured                     Revolving Credit Facility In                     March                     2004, the Company entered into a five-year Unsecured Revolving                     Credit Facility                     (the Facility). The Facility provides for a $450.0 million revolving                     line of                     credit, including up to $50.0 million in available letters of                     credit, bearing                     interest at LIBOR, plus 0.475%. The Facility also bears an annual                     facilities                     fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available                     under the                     line of credit and an annual administrative fee payable quarterly.                     The Facility,                     among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified                     financial                     ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits                     the                     incurrence of certain new indebtedness. The Company used availability                     under the                     Facility to repay $142.3 million of variable-rate debt and to                     purchase                     short-term, state and local government-sponsored municipal bonds.                     The Companys                     $150.0 million revolving credit facility (Old Facility) was terminated                     concurrent with entering into the Facility. The net debt issuance                     costs related                     to the Old Facility and the variable-rate debt totaling $0.7                     million, were                     charged to interest expense in 2004.
Demand                     Revenue Bonds On                     May                     20, 1998, the Company entered into an unsecured Loan Agreement                     with the                     Mississippi Business Finance Corporation (MBFC) under which the                     MBFC issued                     Taxable Variable Rate Demand Revenue Bonds (the Bonds) in an                     aggregate principal                     amount of $19.0 million to finance the acquisition, construction,                     and                     installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment for                     the Company's                     distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. The Bonds                     do not contain a                     prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable.                     The Bonds                     contain a demand provision and, therefore, are classified as                     current                     liabilities.
45 NOTE                     6 - DERIVATIVE                     FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Non-Hedging                     Derivatives At                     February 3, 2007, the Company was party to a derivative instrument                     in the form                     of an interest rate swap that does not qualify for hedge accounting                     treatment                     pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133 because it contains                     a knock-out                     provision. The swap creates the economic equivalent of a fixed                     rate obligation                     by converting the variable-interest rate to a fixed rate. Under                     this interest                     rate swap, the Company pays interest to a financial institution                     at a fixed rate,                     as defined in the agreement. In exchange, the financial institution                     pays the                     Company at a variable interest rate, which approximates the floating                     rate on the                     variable-rate obligation, excluding the credit spread. The interest                     rate on the                     swap is subject to adjustment monthly. No payments are made by                     either party for                     months in which the variable-interest rate, as calculated under                     the swap                     agreement, is greater than the "knock-out rate." The following                     table summarizes                     the terms of the interest rate swap: Derivative Origination Expiration Pay                           Fixed Knock-out Instrument Date Date Rate Rate $18.8                           million swap 4/1/99 4/1/09 4.88% 7.75% This                 swap                 reduces the Company's exposure to the variable interest rate related                 to the                 Demand Revenue Bonds (see Note 5).
Hedging                 Derivative The                 Company was party to one derivative instrument in the form of an                 interest rate                 swap that qualified for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to the                 provisions of                 SFAS No. 133.
In                 2001,                 the Company entered into a $25.0 million interest rate swap agreement                 (swap) to                 manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion                 of the                 Company's variable interest entity debt. In March 2004, the Company                 repaid all                 of the variable interest entity debt with borrowings from the Facility                 (see Note                 5). The Company redesignated this swap to borrowings under the Facility.                 This                 redesignation does not affect the accounting treatment used for this                 interest                 rate swap. The swap created the economic equivalent of fixed-rate                 debt by                 converting the variable-interest rate to a fixed-rate. Under this                 agreement, the                 Company paid interest to a financial institution at a fixed-rate                 of 5.43%. In                 exchange, the financial institution paid the Company at a variable-interest                 rate, which approximated the floating rate on the debt, excluding                 the credit                 spread. The interest rate on the swap was subject to adjustment monthly                 consistent with the interest rate adjustment on the debt. The swap                 expired in                 March 2006.

Share                 Repurchase Programs In                 March                 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0                 million of the Companys common stock through March 2008. During fiscal 2006,                 the Company repurchased 5,650,871 shares for approximately $148.2                 million under                 the March 2005 authorization.
In                 November 2006, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up                 to $500.0 million of the Companys common stock. This amount was in addition to                 the $27.0 million remaining on the March 2005 authorization. In December                 2006,                 the Company entered into two agreements with a third party to repurchase                 approximately $100.0 million of the Companys common shares under an Accelerated                 Share Repurchase Agreement (ASR).
The                 first                 $50.0 million was executed in an uncollared agreement. In this transaction the                 Company initially received 1,656,178 shares based on the market price                 of the                 Companys stock of $30.19 as of the trade date (December 8, 2006). A weighted                 average price is calculated using stock prices from December 16,                 2006 - March 8,                 2007. This represents the calculation period for the weighted average                 price.
If                 the                 weighted average market price, as defined in the agreement, during                 the                 calculation period is greater than the $30.19 price per share, the                 Company will                 deliver to the third party cash or shares of Common Stock (at the                 Companys                 option) equal to the price difference. If the weighted average market                 price is                 less than $30.19 then the third party will deliver to Dollar Tree                 cash equal to                 the price difference. The weighted average market price of the Companys common                 stock through February 3, 2007 was $31.00. Therefore, if the transaction                 had                 settled on February 3, 2007, the Company would have had to return                 43,207 shares                 to the third party which were included in the Companys weighted average                 dilutive potential common shares outstanding calculation. The weighted                 average                 stock price of the Companys common stock as defined in the uncollared agreement as of March 8, 2007 (termination date) was $32.17. The                 Company paid                 the third party an additional $3.3 million on March 8, 2007 for the                 1,656,178                 shares delivered under this agreement The                 remaining $50.0 million relates to a collared agreement in which the Company                 initially received 1,500,703 shares on December 8, 2006, representing                 the                 minimum number of shares under the agreement. The maximum number                 of shares that                 can be received under the agreement is 1,693,101. The number of shares                 is                 determined based on the weighted average market price of the Companys common                 stock during the same calculation period as defined in the uncollared agreement. The weighted average market price through February 3,                 2007 as defined                 in the collared agreement was $30.80. Therefore, if the transaction had                 settled on February 3, 2007, the Company would have received an additional                 122,742 shares under the collared agreement. Based on the applicable                 accounting literature, these additional shares were not included                 in the weighted                 average diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect                 would be antidilutive.                 Based on the weighted average price as of February 3, 2007 of $30.80,                 there is                 approximately $3.8 million of the $50.0 million related to the collared agreement that is recorded as a reduction to stockholders equity pending final                 settlement of the agreement. The weighted average stock price of                 the Companys                 common stock as defined in the collared agreement as of March 8, 2007                 (termination date) was $31.97. The Company received an additional                 63,525 shares                 on March 8, 2007 under this agreement.
47 NOTE                 8 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Profit                 Sharing and 401(k) Retirement Plan The                 Company maintains a defined contribution profit sharing and 401(k)                 plan which is                 available to all employees over 21 years of age who have completed                 one year of                 service in which they have worked at least 1,000 hours.

Deferred                 Compensation Plan The                 Company has a deferred compensation plan which provides certain officers                 and                 executives the ability to defer a portion of their base compensation                 and bonuses                 and invest their deferred amounts. The plan is anonqualified plan                 andthe Company may make discretionary contributions. The deferred amounts                 and earnings thereon are payable to participants, or designated beneficiaries,                 at specified future dates, or upon retirement or death. Total cumulative                 participant deferrals were approximately $2.3 million and $2.0 million,                 respectively, at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 and are included                 in                 "other liabilities" on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.                 The related                 assets are included in "other assets, net" on the accompanying consolidated                 balance sheets. The Company made no discretionary contributions in                 the years                 ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006, and January 29, 2005.
NOTE                 9 - STOCK-BASED                 COMPENSATION PLANS At                 February 3, 2007, the Company has eight stock-based compensation                 plans. Each                 plan and the accounting method are described below.
Fixed                 Stock Option Compensation Plans Under                 the                 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (SOP), the Company granted options                 to its                 employees for 1,047,264 shares of Common Stock in 1993 and 1,048,289                 shares in                 1994. Options granted under the SOP have an exercise price of $0.86                 and are                 fully vested at the date of grant.
Under                 the                 1995 Stock Incentive Plan (SIP), the Company granted options to its                 employees                 for the purchase of up to 12.6 million shares of Common Stock. The                 exercise                 price of each option equaled the market price of the Company's stock                 at the date                 of grant, unless a higher price was established by the Board of Directors,                 and                 an option's maximum term is 10 years. Options granted under the SIP                 generally                 vested over a three-year period. This plan was terminated on July                 1, 2003 and                 replaced with the Companys 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, discussed                 below.
The                 Step                 Ahead Investments, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (SAI Plan) provided                 for the                 issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock                 and                 restricted stock awards to officers and key employees. Effective                 with the merger                 with 98 Cent Clearance Center in December 1998 and in accordance                 with the terms                 of the SAI Plan, outstanding 98 Cent Clearance Center options were                 assumed by                 the Company and converted, based on 1.6818 Company options for each                 98 Cent                 Clearance Center option, to options to purchase the Company's common                 stock.                 Options issued as a result of this conversion were fully vested as                 of the date                 of the merger.
Under                 the                 1998 Special Stock Option Plan (Special Plan), options to purchase                 247,500                 shares were granted to five former officers of 98 Cent Clearance                 Center who were                 serving as employees or consultants of the Company following the                 merger. The                 options were granted as consideration for entering into non-competition                 agreements and a consulting agreement. The exercise price of each                 option equals                 the market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant, and                 the options'                 maximum term is 10 years. Options granted under the Special Plan                 vested over a                 five-year period. As of February 3, 2007, 240,000 of these options                 are still                 outstanding.
48 The                 2003                 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP) replaces the Company's SIP discussed                 above. Under                 the EIP, the Company may grant up to 6.0 million shares of its Common                 Stock,                 plus any shares available for future awards under the SIP, to the                 Companys                 employees, including executive officers and independent contractors.                 The EIP permits the Company to grant equity awards in the form of                 stock options,                 stock appreciation rights and restricted stock. The exercise price                 of each stock                 option granted equals the market price of the Companys stock at the date of                 grant. The options generally vest over a three-year period and have                 a maximum                 term of 10 years.
The                 2004                 Executive Officer Equity Plan (EOEP) is available only to the Chief                 Executive                 Officer and certain other executive officers. These officers no longer                 receive                 awards under the EIP. The EOEP allows the Company to grant the same                 type of                 equity awards as does the EIP. These awards generally vest over a                 three-year                 period, with a maximum term of 10 years.
Stock                 appreciation rights may be awarded alone or in tandem with stock                 options. When                 the stock appreciation rights are exercisable, the holder may surrender                 all or a                 portion of the unexercised stock appreciation right and receive in                 exchange an                 amount equal to the excess of the fair market value at the date of                 exercise over                 the fair market value at the date of the grant. No stock appreciation                 rights                 have been granted to date.
Any                 restricted stock or RSUs awarded are subject to certain general restrictions.                 The restricted stock shares or units may not be sold, transferred,                 pledged or                 disposed of until the restrictions on the shares or units have lapsed                 or have                 been removed under the provisions of the plan. In addition, if a                 holder of                 restricted shares or units ceases to be employed by the Company,                 any shares or                 units in which the restrictions have not lapsed will be forfeited.
The                 2003                 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (NEDP) provides non-qualified                 stock                 options to non-employee members of the Company's Board of Directors.                 The stock                 options are functionally equivalent to such options issued under                 the EIP                 discussed above. The exercise price of each stock option granted                 equals the                 market price of the Companys stock at the date of grant. The options generally                 vest immediately.
The                 2003                 Director Deferred Compensation Plan permits any of the Company's                 directors who                 receive a retainer or other fees for Board or Board committee service                 to defer                 all or a portion of such fees until a future date, at which time                 they may be                 paid in cash or shares of the Company's common stock, or to receive                 all or a                 portion of such fees in non-statutory stock options. Deferred fees                 that are paid                 out in cash will earn interest at the 30-year Treasury Bond Rate.                 If a director                 elects to be paid in common stock, the number of shares will be determined                 by                 dividing the deferred fee amount by the current market price of a                 share of the                 Company's common stock. The number of options issued to a director                 will equal                 the deferred fee amount divided by 33% of the price of a share of                 the Company's                 common stock. The exercise price will equal the fair market value                 of the                 Company's common stock at the date the option is issued. The options                 are fully                 vested when issued and have a term of 10 years.
Stock                 Options In                 2006,                 the Company granted a total of 342,216 stock options from the EIP,                 EOEP and the                 NEDP. For these options, the fair value of each option grant was                 estimated on                 the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and                 the fair                 value of these options of $3.4 million, net of expected forfeitures,                 is being                 recognized over the 3-year vesting period of these options, or a                 shorter period                 based on the retirement eligibility of the grantee. All options granted                 to                 directors vest immediately and are expenses on the grant date. During                 2006, the Company recognized $1.3 million of expense related to the                 2006 option                 grants. As of February 3, 2007, there was approximately $2.1 million                 of total                 unrecognized compensation expense related to these stock options                 which is                 expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 26 months.                 The                 expected term of the awards granted was calculated using the simplified method in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. Expected volatility                 is                 derived from an analysis of the historical and implied volatility                 of the                 Companys publicly traded stock. The risk free rate is based on the U.S.                 Treasury rates on the grant date with maturity dates approximating                 the expected                 life of the option on the grant date. For proforma disclosures required                 under                 FAS 123, the fair value of option awards in 2005 and 2004 was also                 calculated                 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted average                 assumptions                 used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for grants in 2006,                 2005 and 2004                 are as follows: Fiscal                             2006 Fiscal                             2005 Fiscal                             2004 Expected                             term in years 6.0 4.7 5.3 Expected                             volatility 30.2 % 48.7 % 59.8 % Annual                             dividend yield - - - Risk                             free interest rate 4.8 % 3.7 % 3.7 % Weighted                             average fair value of options granted                             during the period $ 10.93 $ 11.27 $ 14.27 Options                             granted 342,216 320,220 1,682,572 49 The                 following tables summarize the Company's various option plans and                 information                 about options outstanding at February 3, 2007 and changes during                 the 53 weeks                 then ended.

Restricted                 Stock The                 Company granted 277,347 and 252,936 RSUs, net of forfeitures in 2006                 and 2005,                 respectively, from the EIP and the EOEP to the Companys employees and officers.                 The fair value of all of these RSUs of $13.9 million is being expensed                 ratably                 over the three-year vesting periods, or a shorter period based on                 the retirement                 eligibility of the grantee. The fair value was determined using the                 Companys                 closing stock price on the date of grant. The Company recognized                 $4.5 million of                 expense related to the RSUs during 2006. As of February 3, 2007,                 there was                 approximately $7.8 million of total unrecognized compensation expense                 related to                 these RSUs which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average                 period of                 24 months. In2005, the Company recognized approximately $1.6 million of                 expense for the RSUs granted in 2005.
In                 2005,                 the Company granted 40,000 RSUs from the EOEP to certain officers                 of the                 Company, contingent on the Company meeting certain performance targets                 in 2005                 and future service of these officers through various points through                 July 2007.                 The Company met these performance targets in fiscal 2005; therefore,                 the fair                 value of these RSUs of $1.0 million is being expensed over the service                 period.                 The fair value of these RSUs was determined using the Companys closing stock                 price January 28, 2006 (the last day of 50 fiscal                 2005), when the performance targets were satisfied. The Company recognized                 $0.3                 million of expense related to these RSUs in 2006. The remaining $0.1                 million                 will be recognized over the vesting periods through July 2007. In                 2005, the                 Company recognized $0.7 million of expense for these RSUs.
In                 2006,                 the Company granted 6,000 RSUs from the EOEP and the EIP to certain                 officers of                 the Company, contingent on the Company meeting certain performance                 targets in                 2006 and future service of the these officers through fiscal 2006.                 The Company                 met these performance targets in fiscal 2006; therefore, the Company                 recognized                 the fair value of these RSUs of $0.2 million during fiscal 2006.                 The fair value                 of these RSUS was determined using the Companys closing stock price on the                 grant date in accordance with SFAS 123R.
The                 following table summarizes the status of RSUs as of February 3, 2007,                 and                 changes during the 53 weeks then ended: Weighted Average Grant Date                               Fair Shares Value Nonvested                               at January 28, 2006 295,507 $ 25.00 Granted 292,697 27.69 Vested (107,097 ) 25.02 Forfeited (24,330 ) 26.63 Nonvested                               at February 3, 2007 456,777 $ 26.57 In                 connection with the vesting of RSUs in 2006, certain employees elected                 to                 receive shares net of minimum statutory tax withholding amounts                 whichtotaled $1.0 million.
Employee                 Stock Purchase Plan Under                 the                 Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), the                 Company is                 authorized to issue up to 1,040,780 shares                 of                 common stock to eligible employees. Under the terms of the ESPP,                 employees can                 choose to have up to 10% of their annual base earnings withheld to                 purchase the                 Company's common stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of                 the lower of                 the price at the beginning or the end of the quarterly offering period.                 Under                 the ESPP, the Company has sold 917,883 shares as of February 3,                 2007.
The                 fair                 value of the employees' purchase rights is estimated on the date                 of grant using                 the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted                 average                 assumptions: Fiscal                           2006 Fiscal                           2005 Fiscal                           2004 Expected                           term 3                           months 3                           months 3                           months Expected                           volatility 13.1 % 12.0 % 15.6 % Annual                           dividend yield - - - Risk                           free interest rate 4.8 % 3.9 % 2.1 % The                 weighted average per share fair value of those purchase rights granted                 in 2006,                 2005 and 2004 was $4.59, $4.11 and $4.93, respectively.
NOTE                 10 - ACQUISITION On                 March                 25, 2006, the Company completed its acquisition of 138 Deal$ stores.                 These                 stores are located primarily in the Midwest part of the United States                 and the                 Company has existing logistics capacity to service these stores.                 This                 acquisition also includes a few combo stores that offer an expanded assortment                 of merchandise including items that sell for more than $1. Substantially                 all                 Deal$ stores acquired will continue to operate under the Deal$ banner                 while                 providing the Company an opportunity to leverage its Dollar Tree                 infrastructure                 in the testing of new merchandise concepts, including higher price                 points,                 without disrupting the single-price point model in its Dollar Tree                 stores.
51 The                 Company paid approximately $32.0 million for store-related and other                 assets and                 $22.1 million forinventory. This amount includes approximately $0.6                 million of direct costs associated with the acquisition. The results                 of Deal$                 store operations are included in the Companys financial statements since the                 acquisition date and did not have a significant impact on the Companys                 operating results in 2006. This acquisition is immaterial to the                 Companys                 operations as a whole and therefore no proforma disclosure of financial                 information has been presented. The following table summarizes the                 allocation of                 the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired.

Item           9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation           of disclosure controls and procedures We           maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure           that           information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities           Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized           and           reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the           Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated           and           communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and           Chief           Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding           required           disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,           we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed           and           operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired           control           objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply our judgment           in           evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and           procedures.
Our           management has carried out, with the participation of the Companys Chief           Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the           effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in           Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our           chief           executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that, as of           February           3, 2007, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective to           provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed           by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,           processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in           Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.
Managements           Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The           Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate           internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule           13a-15(f). The Companys management conducted an assessment of the Companys           internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established           by           the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal           Control-Integrated Framework .           Based           on this assessment, the Companys management has concluded that, as of February           3, 2007, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.           The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has           audited the Companys consolidated financial statements and has issued an           attestation report on managements assessment of the Companys internal control           over financial reporting. Their report appears below.
Changes           in internal controls There           were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting           that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially           affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control           over financial reporting.
Report           of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The           Board           of Directors and Stockholders Dollar           Tree Stores, Inc.: We           have           audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Managements           Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Dollar Tree Stores,           Inc. (the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial           reporting as of February 3, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal           Control-Integrated Framework ,           issued           by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission           (COSO) .
The           Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal           control           over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of           internal           control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion           on           management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys           internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We           conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company           Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that           we plan           and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective           internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material           respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control           over           financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating           the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing           such           other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe           that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
To           Table of Contents 54 A           company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed           to           provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting           and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance           with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal           control           over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)           pertain           to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and           fairly           reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;           (2)           provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary           to           permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally           accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the           company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management           and           directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding           prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition           of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial           statements.
Because           of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting           may not           prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of           effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may           become           inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance           with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In           our           opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective           internal           control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2007 is fairly stated,           in all           material respects, based on criteria established in Internal           ControlIntegrated Framework ,           issued           by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission           (COSO) .
Also, in           our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective           internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2007, based           on criteria           established in Internal           ControlIntegrated Framework ,           issued           by the Committee of           Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) .
We           also           have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting           Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Dollar           Tree           Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006,           and           the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and           comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the           three-year period ended February 3, 2007, and our report dated April 2,           2007           expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial           statements.
