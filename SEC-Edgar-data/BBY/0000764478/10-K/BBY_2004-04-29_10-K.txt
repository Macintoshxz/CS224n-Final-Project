Overview History We are a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home-office  equipment, entertainment software and appliances with revenue from continuing  operations of $20.9 billion for our fiscal year ended March 1, 2003. We operate  retail stores and commercial Web sites as part of continuing operations under  the brand names Best Buy (BestBuy.com), Future Shop (FutureShop.ca) and  Magnolia Hi-Fi (MagnoliaHiFi.com).
We began in 1966 as an audio components retailer, and with the  introduction of the videocassette recorder in the early 1980s, expanded into  video products. In 1983, we revised our marketing strategy and began using  mass-merchandising techniques, which included offering a wider variety of  products and operating stores under a superstore concept. In 1989, we  dramatically changed our method of retailing by introducing a self-service,  noncommissioned, discountstyle store concept designed to give the  customer more control over the purchasing process. In fiscal 2000, we  introduced a smallmarket Best Buy store concept that offers merchandise  in the same product categories as larger stores, with a product assortment  tailored to each respective community.  The Best Buy store concept has evolved to include more interactive  displays and, for certain products, a higher level of customer service, with  the latest version designed to increase labor efficiency and to improve  merchandising. In fiscal 2004, we plan to enhance our store formats and  customize product offerings to meet the needs of customers in different  markets. This plan is consistent with  customer centricity, one of the four key strategic priorities we formalized in  fiscal 2003.
In fiscal 2000, we established Best Buy stores online shopping site,  BestBuy.com. Our clicks-and-mortar strategy is designed to empower consumers to  research and purchase products seamlessly either online or in retail stores.  The online site offers products in all of Best Buy stores principal product  categories. In fiscal 2004, we expect  to unveil a Web site with enhanced features including the ability to offer  online consumers an even broader product assortment than we carry in Best Buy  stores.
Acquisitions In the fourth quarter of  fiscal 2001, we acquired the common stock of Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc. (Magnolia  Hi-Fi) for $88 million in cash, including transaction costs. Magnolia Hi-Fi is  a Seattle-based, high-end retailer of audio and video products that operated 19  stores in Washington, Oregon and California as of March 1, 2003. We acquired  Magnolia Hi-Fi to access new customers.
In the third quarter of  fiscal 2002, we acquired all of the common stock of Future Shop Ltd. (Future  Shop) for $368 million, net of cash acquired, including transaction costs.  Future Shop, which operated 104 stores as of March 1, 2003, is Canadas largest  consumer electronics retailer and offers product categories similar to that of  Best Buy stores. We acquired Future Shop to further our expansion plans,  leverage our expertise in consumer electronics retailing and increase  shareholder value. The acquisition marked our initial expansion into  international operations.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we acquired all of the common  stock of Geek Squad, Inc. (Geek Squad) for approximately $3 million, net of  cash acquired, including transaction costs. Geek Squad provides residential  consumer computer support. We acquired Geek Squad to further our plans of  providing technology support services to customers.
Additional information  regarding our acquisitions is included in note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements on page 54 of our Annual Report, contained in  Exhibit13.1 to this report, and is incorporated herein by reference.
In fiscal 2003, we put on hold any major acquisitions or expansion  beyond North America to focus on our core business.
Discontinued  Operations In addition to the acquisitions described above, in the fourth quarter  of fiscal 2001, we acquired the common stock of Musicland Stores Corporation  (Musicland) for $425 million, including transaction costs, plus long-term debt  valued at $271 million. Musicland is primarily a mall-based national retailer  of movies, prerecorded music and other entertainment-related products. At the  end of fiscal 2003, Musicland operated 1,195 retail stores in 48 states, the  District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and commercial  Web sites under the brand names Media Play (MediaPlay.com), Sam Goody  (SamGoody.com) and Suncoast (Suncoast.com).
The original strategy behind the Musicland acquisition was to bring  Best Buys core competencies in retailing consumer electronics to new consumer  segments, including segments typically underserved by our Best Buy stores.  However, the Musicland business did not meet our financial objectives. After  carefully considering several alternatives, we determined that the interests of  our shareholders, employees, vendors and landlords would be best served by a  sale of the business. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we  committed to a plan to sell our interest in Musicland. We have retained a  national investment banking firm to assist with the sale process, as well as  additional professionals to assist in other areas of the plan. Musiclands  financial results have been classified separately as discontinued operations in  our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. The sale of  our interest in Musicland will allow us to focus on our consumer electronics  stores, which are the core profit drivers for our business.
Additional information regarding Discontinued Operations is included in  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial  Condition beginning on page 20 of our Annual Report and note 2 of the Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 52 of our Annual Report,  incorporated herein by reference.
Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion relates to continuing operations  only.
Business  Strategy Our vision is to make life fun and easy. Our business strategy is to  bring technology and consumers together in a retail environment that focuses on  educating consumers on the features and benefits of technology and entertainment  products, while maximizing overall profitability. We believe our stores offer  consumers meaningful advantages in store environment, product value, selection  and service, all of which advance our objectives of enhancing our business  model, gaining market share and improving profitability. The Future Shop and  Magnolia Hi-Fi acquisitions provide us with access to new distribution channels  and new customers.
During fiscal 2003, we formalized four strategic priorities that we  believe will further enhance our business model over the next several  years. Additional information on our  strategic priorities is included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of  Results of Operations and Financial Condition beginning on page 20 of our  Annual Report, incorporated herein by reference.
Store  Development The addition of new stores has played, and we believe it will continue  to play, a significant role in our continued growth and success. Our store development program focuses on  entering new markets, adding stores within existing markets and relocating,  remodeling and/or expanding existing stores.  During fiscal 2003, we opened 90 new stores and 17 stores were  remodeled, relocated or expanded. While  many of the new stores opened in fiscal 2003 were in existing markets, others  were in new markets including the opening of our first Best Buy store in  Manhattan, as well as the opening of the first Best Buy stores in Canada. During fiscal 2004, we expect to open 4 approximately 80 new stores, most of which will be located in existing  markets. We believe that continuing to  grow our store base and locating our stores in desirable geographic markets are  essential to our future success.
Additional information regarding our Outlook for Fiscal 2004 is  included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and  Financial Condition on page 37 of our Annual Report, incorporated herein by  reference.
Customers We do not have a significant concentration of sales with any individual  customer and, therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material  impact on our business. No single customer accounts for 10% or more of our  total revenue.
Suppliers Our strategy depends, in part, upon our ability to offer customers a  broad selection of name-brand products and, therefore, our success is dependent  upon satisfactory and stable supplier relationships. In fiscal 2003, our 20  largest suppliers accounted for over half of the merchandise we purchased, with  five suppliers  Sony, Hewlett-Packard, Toshiba, Panasonic and Samsung   representing approximately one-third of total merchandise purchased. The loss  of or disruption in supply from any one of these major suppliers could have a  material adverse effect on our revenue and profits. We generally do not have  long-term written contracts with our major suppliers. We have no indication  that any of our suppliers will discontinue selling us merchandise. We have not  experienced significant difficulty in maintaining satisfactory sources of  supply, and we generally expect that adequate sources of supply will continue  to exist for the types of merchandise sold in our stores.
Working  Capital We fund the growth of our business through a combination of existing  cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from continuing operations.  In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional  working capital needs or investment opportunities.
Additional information on our Liquidity and Capital Resources is included  in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial  Condition beginning on page 31 of our Annual Report, incorporated herein by  reference.
Available  Information We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and  its rules and regulations. The Exchange  Act requires us to file reports, proxy statements and other information with  the SEC. Copies of these reports, proxy statements and other information can be  inspected and copied at: SEC Public Reference Room 450 Fifth Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20549 You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference  Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
You may also obtain these materials electronically by accessing the  SECs home page on the Internet at: http://www.sec.gov In addition, we make available, free of charge on our Internet Web  site, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current  Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant  to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable  after we electronically file this material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

At the end of fiscal 2003, the Domestic segment included U.S.  Best Buy and Magnolia Hi-Fi stores. U.S. Best Buy stores offer a wide variety  of consumer electronics, home-office equipment, entertainment software and  appliances, and operated 548 stores in 48 states at the end of fiscal 2003.  Magnolia Hi-Fi is a high-end retailer of audio and video products and had 19  stores in Washington, Oregon and California at March 1, 2003. The International  segment was established in connection with our acquisition of Future Shop in  November of fiscal 2002. At the end of fiscal 2003, the International segment  consisted of 104 Future Shop stores operating in all Canadian provinces and  eight Canadian Best Buy stores operating in Ontario. Future Shop and Canadian  Best Buy stores offer products similar to those offered by U.S. Best Buy  stores.
During fiscal 2002, we had three reportable operating segments: Best  Buy, Musicland and International. The  primary reasons for the combining of our domestic operations into one  reportable operating segment were the significant similarities of their  respective products and markets, the leveraging of our buying and distribution  functions and the merging of many of our operational functions into a shared  services model in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Based on our commitment to  a plan to sell our interest in Musicland, Musiclands financial results are no  longer included in the Domestic segment, but rather are reported separately as  discontinued operations.

In addition, selected  operating segment financial data is included in note 10 of the Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements on page 62 of our Annual Report, incorporated  herein by reference.
Domestic Segment U.S. Best Buy Stores Overview At the end of fiscal 2003, we operated 548 U.S. Best Buy stores in 48  states. The stores average approximately 44,200 retail square feet and produce  average annual revenue of approximately $37.1million. U.S. Best Buy  stores collectively represent approximately 24.2million retail square  feet, or about 90% of our total retail square footage. During fiscal 2002, U.S.  Best Buy stores launched its latest store concept, which was designed to  provide a more flexible architecture, improved merchandising, faster checkout,  better product adjacencies and a more efficient labor model. Most new U.S. Best  Buy stores opened in fiscal 2003 incorporated the features of this latest store  format.

Consumer electronics, the largest product category based on revenue,  consists of video and audio equipment. Video products include television sets,  DVD players, cameras, camcorders, VCRs and digital broadcast satellite systems.  Audio products include car stereos, portable audio equipment, home theater  audio systems, audio components, shelf systems and speakers. The home office  category includes desktop and notebook computers and related peripheral  equipment, telephones, wireless communication devices and personal digital  assistants. Entertainment software products include compact discs, video game  hardware and software, DVD and VHS movies, and computer software. The appliance  category includes washers, dryers, ranges, refrigerators, freezers and  dishwashers, as well as vacuums, microwaves and housewares. The other product  category includes extended service contracts, blank recording media, furniture  and other miscellaneous products such as batteries, business cases and storage  products.
The following table presents U.S. Best Buy stores revenue, by product  category, as a percentage of total U.S. Best Buy stores revenue: Product Category Percentage    of Total Revenue Fiscal 2003 Percentage    of Total Revenue Fiscal 2002 Percentage    of Total Revenue Fiscal 2001 Consumer    Electronics 34 % 33 % 33 % Home Office 30 % 31 % 34 % Entertainment    Software 22 % 22 % 19 % Appliances 6 % 6 % 7 % Other 8 % 8 % 7 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Operations U.S. Best Buy stores follow a standardized and detailed operating  procedure called Standard Operating Platform (SOP). The SOP includes procedures  for inventory management, transaction processing, customer relations, store  administration, product sales and merchandise display.
U.S. Best Buy store operations are organized into three divisions. Each  division is divided into regions and is under the supervision of a senior vice  president who oversees store performance through regional vice presidents.  Regional vice presidents have responsibility for a number of districts within  their respective region. District managers monitor store operations and meet  regularly with store managers to discuss merchandising, new product introductions,  sales promotions, customer loyalty programs, employee satisfaction surveys and  store operating performance. Similar meetings are conducted at the corporate  level with divisional and regional management. A senior vice president of  retail operations has overall responsibility for retail store processing and  operations, including labor management. Each district also has a loss  prevention manager, with product security personnel employed at each store to  control physical inventory losses. Advertising, merchandise buying and pricing,  and inventory policies for U.S. Best Buy stores are centrally controlled.
6 U.S. Best Buy stores are generally open 73 hours a week, seven days a  week. A store is typically staffed by one manager and four to five assistant  managers. The average staff in each store ranges from 65 to 150 people,  depending on store size and sales volume.
Distribution Generally, merchandise is shipped to U.S. Best Buy stores from one of  six distribution centers located in California, Georgia, Minnesota, Ohio,  Oklahoma and Virginia. U.S. Best Buy stores also currently operate two  dedicated distribution centers for entertainment software in Minnesota and  Indiana. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we opened an  additional general distribution center in upstate New York. The majority of  U.S. Best Buy stores merchandise, except for major appliances and large-screen  televisions, is shipped directly from manufacturers to a distribution center.  Major appliances and large-screen televisions are shipped to satellite  warehouses in each major market. U.S. Best Buy stores are dependent upon the  distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment of most merchandise.  However, in order to meet release dates for selected products and to improve  inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to the stores  from manufacturers and distributors. We believe our current distribution  centers and the relocation of the Ardmore, Oklahoma, distribution center to a  larger facility in fiscal 2005, will accommodate expansion plans for the next  several years. On average, U.S. Best Buy stores receive product shipments two  or three times a week depending on sales volume. Generally, e-commerce  merchandise sales are either picked up at U.S. Best Buy retail stores or  fulfilled through the distribution centers.
Seasonality Similar  to many retailers, U.S. Best Buy stores business is seasonal. Revenue and  earnings are typically greater during the second half of the fiscal year, which  includes the holiday selling season.
Competition U.S.  Best Buy stores industry is highly competitive. U.S. Best Buy stores compete  nationally against other consumer electronics retailers, specialty home office  retailers, mass merchants, home improvement superstores and a growing number of  direct-to-consumer alternatives. U.S. Best Buy stores also compete against  independent dealers, regional chain discount stores, wholesale clubs,  mail-order and Internet retailers, video rental stores and other specialty  retail stores. Mass merchandisers continue to increase their assortment of  consumer electronics products  primarily those that are less complex to sell,  install and operate. Similarly, large home improvement retailers are expanding  their assortment of appliances. In addition, consumers are increasingly  downloading entertainment and computer software directly via the Internet.
We believe our U.S. Best  Buy stores formats and brand marketing strategies are differentiated from most  competitors' by positioning our U.S. Best Buy retail stores as the destination  for new technology and entertainment products in a fun, informative and  noncommissioned shopping environment. U.S. Best Buy stores compete by  aggressively advertising and emphasizing a broad product assortment, value  pricing and financing alternatives. In addition, we believe Best Buys  e-commerce operations, coupled with the knowledgeable sales associates and  service capabilities of U.S. Best Buy retail stores, have effectively  positioned us to compete successfully, despite an increasingly competitive  environment.
Magnolia Hi-Fi Overview In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we acquired Seattle-based  Magnolia Hi-Fi, a retailer of high-end consumer electronics, founded in 1954.  At the end of fiscal 2003, Magnolia Hi-Fi operated 19 stores in Washington,  Oregon and California that average approximately 10,000 retail square feet and  generate average annual revenue per store of $6.9 million. Collectively,  Magnolia Hi-Fi stores represent approximately 189,000 retail square feet, less  than 1% of our total retail square footage.
The following table reconciles Magnolia Hi-Fi stores open at the  beginning and end of each fiscal year since the date of acquisition: Fiscal Year Stores Opened Stores Closed Total    Stores at End of Fiscal Year Balance Forward* n.a.
n.a.
13 2001   13 2002   13 2003 6  19 *As of the date of acquisition, December 15, 2000 Merchandise Magnolia  Hi-Fi stores offer merchandise in three product categories: consumer  electronics, home office and other products.  Consumer electronics, the largest product category based on revenue,  consists of video and audio equipment. Video products include television sets,  DVD players, digital cameras, digital camcorders, mobile video, VCRs, digital  broadcast satellite systems and video accessories. Audio products include home receivers and amplifiers, home  speakers, shelf systems, portable audio equipment, audio accessories, car  stereos and car security systems. The  home office category includes telephones and wireless communication  devices. The other product category  includes extended service contracts, customer equipment repairs, and in-home  and automobile installation labor and parts.
The following table presents Magnolia Hi-Fi revenue, by product  category, as a percentage of total Magnolia Hi-Fi revenue: Product Category Percentage    of Total Revenue Fiscal 2003 Percentage    of Total Revenue Fiscal 2002 Consumer    Electronics 87 % 86 % Home Office 4 % 4 % Other 9 % 10 % Total 100 % 100 % Operations Magnolia Hi-Fi stores are typically managed by a store manager, an  audio/video sales manager and a mobile electronics sales manager. Magnolia HiFi  stores are generally open 72 hours a week, seven days a week. Depending on an  individual stores volume, store staffing includes eight to 25 commissioned  sales personnel, two to six commissioned mobile electronics installers, one to  six digital products sales personnel, cashiers and warehouse personnel.  Advertising, merchandise buying and pricing, and inventory policies for  Magnolia Hi-Fi stores are centrally controlled.
7 Distribution Magnolia  Hi-Fis merchandise is received and warehoused at its distribution center in  Washington or at its regional warehouse in California. All inventory is bar  coded and scanned to ensure accurate inventory tracking. In addition, a  computerized inventory replenishment program is used to maintain optimal  inventory levels at each retail store.
Merchandise is delivered to retail stores an average  of three times each week via Magnolia Hi-Fis in-house distribution system.
Seasonality Similar  to many retailers, Magnolia Hi-Fis business is seasonal. Revenue and earnings  are typically greater during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes  the holiday selling season.
Competition Magnolia Hi-Fi competes with a variety of national, regional and local  retailers, including large consumer electronics superstores, mass merchants and  small specialty stores.
Magnolia Hi-Fi has positioned itself between large mass merchants and  high-end specialty boutiques. We believe Magnolia Hi-Fis quality product  offerings, extensively trained sales staff and focus on exceptional customer  service both before and after the sale, in combination with the leveraging of  U.S. Best Buy stores core competencies, effectively position Magnolia Hi-Fi to  meet current and future competitive challenges.
International Segment Overview The International segment  was established in connection with our acquisition of Future Shop in November  of fiscal 2002. At the end of fiscal 2003, the International segment consisted  of 104 Future Shop stores in all Canadian provinces and eight Canadian Best Buy  stores in Ontario. Collectively,  International stores generate average annual revenue of approximately  $16.0million per store and represent approximately 2.4million  retail square feet, or 9% of our total retail square footage.
The Future Shop  acquisition accelerated our international expansion plans and provided us with  an opportunity to increase revenue, gain market share and leverage our  operational expertise. We continue to build on Future Shops position as the  leading consumer electronics retailer in Canada. During fiscal 2003, we opened nine new Future Shop stores. These new stores strengthen our presence in  Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec. In addition to investments in new store  openings, we also enhanced the Future Shop Web site. The Web site provides an increasingly important avenue for  reaching consumers and enhancing the Future Shop brand in Canada.
The primary objective of  our International segment in fiscal 2003 was launching our dual-branding  strategy in Canada. We introduced the  Best Buy brand in Canada by opening eight Best Buy stores in the Toronto,  Ontario market. The Canadian Best Buy stores are similar to the U.S. Best Buy  stores and appeal to technology and entertainment enthusiasts who enjoy the  interactive shopping experience and grab-and-go convenience for which Best Buy  is known. As we increase the presence of Best Buy stores in Canada, we expect  to gain operating efficiencies through the leveraging of our capital  investments, supply chain management, advertising, merchandising and  administrative functions.
The dual-branding  strategy was designed to retain Future Shops brand equity and attract more  customers by offering a choice of store experiences. Our goal is to reach  differentiated customers with each brand by giving them the unique shopping  experiences they desire. The primary differences between the two brands are: In-store  experience The customers interaction with store employees  is different at each of the two brands. Future Shop has commissioned sales  associates who take a more proactive role in assisting customers. Through their  expertise and attentiveness, the sales associate drives the transaction. In contrast, Canadian Best Buy store  employees are noncommissioned, and the stores offer more interactive displays  and grab-and-go merchandising. This  design allows the customer to drive the transaction as they experience the  products themselves, with store employees available to provide product  information and explain product features.
Store  size The average Future Shop store is approximately 21,000  retail square feet, compared with an average of approximately 28,000 retail  square feet for Canadian Best Buy stores.  Canadian Best Buy stores generally have wider aisles, with more square  footage devoted to entertainment software.

2002    2003 8  8 Merchandise International stores generally offer merchandise in five product  categories: consumer electronics, home office, entertainment software,  appliances and other products. Home office, the largest product category  based on revenue, includes desktop and notebook computers and related  peripheral equipment, telephones, wireless communication devices and personal  digital assistants. The consumer electronics category consists of video and  audio equipment. Video products include television sets, DVD players, cameras,  camcorders, VCRs and digital broadcast satellite systems. Audio products  include car stereos, portable audio equipment, home theater 8 audio systems, audio components, shelf systems and speakers.  Entertainment software products include compact discs, video game hardware and  software, DVD and VHS movies, and computer software. The appliance category  includes washers, dryers, ranges, refrigerators, freezers and dishwashers, as  well as vacuums, microwaves and housewares. The other product category  includes extended service contracts, blank recording media, furniture and other  miscellaneous products such as batteries, business cases and storage products.
Although the two store brands carry similar product categories, there  are differences in product brands and depth of selection within product  categories. On average, less than 55  percent of the product assortment overlaps (excluding entertainment software)  between the two store brands.
The following table presents International revenue, by product  category, as a percentage of total International revenue: Product Category Percentage    of Total Revenue Fiscal 2003 Percentage    of Total Revenue Fiscal 2002* Home Office 38 % 39 % Consumer    Electronics 34 % 34 % Entertainment    Software 15 % 17 % Appliances 5 % 4 % Other 8 % 6 % Total 100 % 100 % * Subsequent to the date of acquisition, November 4, 2001 Operations International stores use a standardized operating system. The operating  system includes procedures for inventory management, transaction processing,  customer relations, store administration, staff training and performance  appraisal as well as merchandise display. Advertising, merchandise buying and  pricing, and inventory policies are centrally controlled.
International store operations are organized into divisions, each  headed by a vice president. Each vice president has regional management who  closely monitor store operations and meet regularly with store managers to  review management and staff training programs, customer feedback and requests,  store operating performance and other matters. Meetings involving store  management, product managers, advertising, financial and administrative staff,  as well as senior regional and global headquarters personnel, are held  quarterly to review operating results and to establish future objectives.
International stores are generally open 60 to 75 hours a week, seven  days a week. A typical store is staffed by a general manager, several  department sales managers, a customer service manager and on average 39  full-time staff associates, as well as part-time associates. The number of  full-time staff associates is dependent upon store size, sales volume and store  brand.
Distribution The majority of International stores  merchandise, except for appliances, is shipped directly from suppliers to  distribution centers in British Columbia and Ontario. Contract carriers ship  merchandise from the distribution centers to retail stores. The majority of  appliance sales are delivered by third-party distributors. International stores  are dependent upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment  of most merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected  products and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped  directly to the stores from manufacturers and distributors. International  stores typically receive product shipments twice a week, with accelerated  shipments during periods of high sales volume.
Seasonality Similar to many retailers, the International segments business is  seasonal. Revenue and earnings are typically greater during the second half of  the fiscal year, which includes the holiday selling season.
Competition The Canadian marketplace is highly competitive and highly fragmented.  International stores compete against other consumer electronics retailers,  specialty home office retailers, mass merchants, home improvement superstores  and a growing number of direct-to-consumer alternatives. International stores  also compete against independent dealers, regional chain discount stores,  wholesale clubs, mail-order and Internet retailers, video rental stores and  other specialty retail stores. Mass merchandisers continue to increase their  assortment of consumer electronics products  primarily those that are less  complex to sell, install and operate. Similarly, large home improvement  retailers are expanding their assortment of appliances. In addition, consumers  are increasingly downloading entertainment and computer software directly via  the Internet.
We believe our International segments price  leadership, large product assortment, focus on customer service and  complementary e-commerce operations effectively positions us to meet current  and future competitive conditions.

Our debt is not subject to material interest-rate volatility risk. The  rates on a substantial portion of our debt may be reset, but may not be more  than one percentage point higher than the current rates. If the rates on the  debt were to be reset one percentage point higher, our annual interest expense  would increase by approximately $8 million. We do not currently manage the risk  through the use of derivative instruments.
We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange  rates as a result of our acquisition of Future Shop in Canada in November 2001.  At this time, we do not manage the risk through the use of derivative  instruments. A 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rate would  not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial  position.
