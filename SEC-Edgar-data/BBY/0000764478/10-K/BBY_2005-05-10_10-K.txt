Description of Business We are a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home-office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services. We operate retail stores and/or commercial Web sites under the brand names Best Buy (BestBuy.com and BestBuyCanada.ca), Future Shop (FutureShop.ca), Magnolia Audio Video (MagnoliaAV.com) and Geek Squad (GeekSquad.com), as well as an outlet store on eBay.
Our vision is to make life fun and easy for consumers. Our business strategy is to bring technology and consumers together in a retail environment that focuses on educating consumers on the features and benefits of technology and entertainment products, while maximizing overall profitability. We believe our stores offer consumers meaningful advantages in store environment, product value, product selection and customer service, all of which advance our objectives of enhancing our business model, gaining market share and improving profitability. During fiscal 2003, we adopted four strategic initiatives that we believe will further enhance our business model. Additional information on our strategic initiatives is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
We were incorporated in the state of Minnesota in 1966 as Sound of Music,Inc., and changed our name to Best Buy Co.,Inc. in 1983. We began as an audio components retailer, and with the introduction of the videocassette recorder in the early 1980s, expanded into video products. In 1983, we revised our marketing strategy and began using mass-merchandising techniques, which included offering a wider variety of products and operating stores under a "superstore" concept. In 1989, we dramatically changed our method of retailing by introducing a self-service, noncommissioned, discount-style store concept designed to give the customer more control over the purchasing process.
In fiscal 2000, we established our first online shopping site, BestBuy.com. Our "clicks-and-mortar" strategy is designed to empower consumers to research and purchase products seamlessly either online or in retail stores. Our online shopping site offers products in all of our principal product categories. In fiscal 2004, we continued to make enhancements to improve the shopping experience on our Websites.
The Best Buy store format has evolved to include more interactive displays and, for certain products, a higher level of customer service, with the latest version designed to increase labor efficiency and to improve merchandising. In fiscal 2000, we introduced a small-market Best Buy store concept that offers merchandise in the same product categories as larger stores, with a product assortment tailored to each respective community. In fiscal 2004, as part of our customer centricity initiative, we developed and tested several new store formats and customized the product offerings within these stores to meet the needs of our customers better.
Our International segment was established in connection with our acquisition of Future ShopLtd. (Future Shop) in fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, we launched our dual-branding strategy in Canada by introducing the Best Buy brand. We continue to believe the Canadian market can support both brands.
Acquisitions In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we acquired the common stock of Magnolia Hi-Fi,Inc. (Magnolia Hi-Fi), a Seattle-based, high-end retailer of audio and video products, for $88million in cash. We acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi to access an upscale customer segment. During fiscal 2004, Magnolia Hi-Fi began doing business as Magnolia Audio Video. We believe the new name and redesigned logo are more representative of 3 Magnolia Audio Video's image as an upscale retailer of high-end consumer electronics.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we acquired all of the common stock of Future Shop for $377million. The Future Shop acquisition marked our expansion into international operations and provided us with an opportunity to increase revenue, gain market share, leverage our operational expertise in consumer electronics retailing and increase shareholder value. Since the acquisition, we have continued to build on Future Shop's position as the leading consumer electronics retailer in Canada.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we acquired all of the common stock of Geek Squad,Inc. (Geek Squad) for approximately $3million. Geek Squad provides residential and commercial computer support services. We acquired Geek Squad to further our plans of providing technology support services to customers. As of February28, 2004, Geek Squad service was available in seven markets and had in-store technicians in more than 20 U.S. Best Buy stores. By the end of fiscal 2005, we expect to have Geek Squad technicians available in the majority of our U.S. Best Buy stores. Geek Squad's operations were a very small part of our fiscal 2004 business. However, our goal is to make Geek Squad North America's largest provider of in-home computer repair and installation services, and we believe that over timeit will become a more significant factor in ourbusiness.
All three acquisitions described above were accounted for using the purchase method. Under this method, net assets and results of operations of those businesses were included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
In fiscal 2003, we put on hold any major acquisitions or expansion beyond North America to focus on our core business. During our fiscal 2004 fourth-quarter earnings conference call on March31, 2004, we confirmed that we do not intend to make any material acquisitions for the next 18months.
Additional information regarding our acquisitions is available in Note3, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
General Development of Business During our fiscal year ended February28, 2004, there were no significant changes to our corporate structure or material changes in our mode of conducting the business, except as follows: Sale of Musicland On June16, 2003, we sold our interest in The Musicland Group,Inc. (Musicland) to an affiliate of Sun Capital PartnersInc. The affiliate of Sun Capital PartnersInc. assumed all of Musicland's liabilities, including approximately $500million in lease obligations, in exchange for all of the capital stock of Musicland, and paid no cash consideration. The transaction also resulted in the transfer of all of Musicland's assets other than a distribution center in Franklin, Indiana, and selected nonoperating assets. The sale of our interest in Musicland resulted in an after-tax loss on the disposal of discontinued operations totaling $66million. In connection with the sale, Musicland is purchasing transition support services from us for up to one year from the date of the sale, until Musicland is able to develop long-term providers for these services.
We acquired the common stock of Musicland Stores Corporation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The original strategy behind our Musicland acquisition was to bring Best Buy's core competencies in retailing consumer electronics to new consumer segments, including segments typically underserved by our Best Buy stores. However, the Musicland business did not meet our financial objectives. The sale of our interest in Musicland allows us to focus on our core business, which is our primary growth and profit driver. Musicland's financial results have been classified separately as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
4 Additional information regarding Discontinued Operations is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , and Note2, Discontinued Operations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion relates to continuing operations only.
Financial Information about Segments During fiscal 2004, we operated two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of U.S. Best Buy and Magnolia Audio Video operations. U.S. Best Buy stores offer a wide variety of consumer electronics, home-office equipment, entertainment software, appliances and related services. Magnolia Audio Video stores offer high-end audio and video products. The International segment is comprised of Future Shop and Best Buy operations in Canada. Future Shop and Canadian Best Buy stores offer products similar to those offered by U.S. Best Buy stores.
Additional information regarding our "Segment Performance" is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of this Annual Report on Form10-K. In addition, selected financial data for our segments is available in Note10, Segments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Reference is also made to PartII, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk , of this Annual Report on Form10-K for a discussion regarding the risks associated with foreign operations.
Domestic Segment Overview U.S. Best Buy At February28, 2004, we operated 608 U.S. BestBuy stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia that averaged approximately 43,500 retail square feet. Collectively, U.S. Best Buy stores totaled approximately 26.4million retail square feet at the end of fiscal 2004, or about 90% of the Company's total retail square footage. For fiscal 2004, U.S. Best Buy retail stores generated average revenue of approximately $38.6million per store.
Magnolia Audio Video At February28, 2004, we operated 22 Magnolia Audio Video stores in California, Washington and Oregon that averaged approximately 10,000 retail square feet. Collectively, Magnolia Audio Video stores totaled approximately 218,000 retail square feet at the end of fiscal 2004, less than 1% of the Company's total retail square footage. For fiscal 2004, Magnolia Audio Video retail stores generated average revenue of approximately $6.5million per store.
Operations U.S. Best Buy U.S. Best Buy stores follow a standardized and detailed operating procedure called Standard Operating Platform (SOP). The SOP includes procedures for inventory management, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, product sales and merchandise display. All stores function in exactly the same manner under the SOP. During fiscal 2004, in conjunction with our customer centricity initiative, we began testing a new, Adaptive Operating Platform (AOP). The AOP decentralizes authority and allows the person closest to the customer to make informed decisions. This change may involve some variation in product offerings, staffing, promotions and store design.
U.S. Best Buy store operations are organized into three divisions. Each division is divided into regions and is under the supervision of a senior 5 vice president who oversees store performance through regional vice presidents. Regional vice presidents have responsibility for a number of districts within their respective region. District managers monitor store operations and meet regularly with store managers to discuss merchandising, new product introductions, sales promotions, customer loyalty programs, employee satisfaction surveys and store operating performance. Similar meetings are conducted at the corporate level with divisional and regional management. Our Senior Vice President of retail operations has overall responsibility for retail store processing and operations, including labor management. Each district also has a loss prevention manager, with product security personnel employed at each store to control physical inventory losses. Advertising, merchandise buying and pricing, as well as inventory policies for U.S. Best Buy stores are centrally controlled.
U.S. Best Buy stores are generally open 75hours per week, seven days a week. A store is typically staffed by one manager and four to five assistant managers. The average staff in each store ranges from 65 to 150 people, depending on store size and sales volume. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the management structure and store staffing levels of our U.S. Best Buy stores were adjusted and is now based on sales productivity. Previously, management structures and store staffing levels were based primarily on store size.
Magnolia Audio Video Magnolia Audio Video stores are typically managed by a store manager, an audio/video sales manager and, if the store contains mobile products, a mobile electronics sales manager. Magnolia Audio Video stores are generally open 72hours per week, seven days a week. Depending on an individual store's volume and product offerings, store staffing includes eight to 25 commissioned sales personnel, two to six commissioned mobile electronics installers and one to five sales support staff personnel. Corporate management for Magnolia Audio Video stores centrally controls advertising, merchandise buying and pricing, as well as inventory policies.
International Segment Overview At February28, 2004, we operated 108 Future Shop stores throughout all Canadian provinces and 19 Canadian Best Buy stores in Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba. Collectively, International stores totaled approximately 2.8million retail square feet, or about 10% of the Company's total retail square footage, as of the end of fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, International retail stores generated average revenue of approximately $19.4million per store.
The dual-branding strategy allows us to retain Future Shop's brand equity and attract more customers by offering a choice of store experiences. As we expand the presence of Best Buy stores in Canada, we expect to gain operating efficiencies through the leveraging of our capital investments, supply chain management, advertising, merchandising and administrative functions. Our goal is to reach differentiated customers with each brand by giving them the unique shopping experiences they desire. The primary differences between our two Canadian brands are: In-store experience The customer's interaction with store employees is different at each of the two brands. Future Shop stores have commissioned sales associates who take a more proactive role in assisting customers. Through their expertise and attentiveness, the sales associate drives the transaction. In contrast, Canadian Best Buy store employees are noncommissioned, and the stores offer moreinteractive displays and grab-and-go merchandising. This design allows the customer to drive the transaction as they experience the products themselves, with store employees available to demonstrate and explain productfeatures.
Store size At the end of fiscal 2004, the average Future Shop store was approximately 21,000 retail square feet, compared with an average of approximately 29,000 retail square feet for Canadian Best Buy stores. Canadian 6 Best Buy stores generally have wider aisles, as well as more square footage devoted to entertainment software.
Operations International stores use a standardized operating system. The operating system includes procedures for inventory management, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, staff training and performance appraisal, as well as merchandise display. Advertising, merchandise buying and pricing, and inventory policies are centrally controlled.
International store operations are organized to support two brands, each headed by a vice president. Each vice president has regional management who closely monitor store operations and meet regularly with store managers to review management and staff training programs, customer feedback and requests, store operating performance and other matters. Meetings involving store management, product managers, advertising, financial and administrative staff, as well as senior management, are held quarterly toreview operating results and to establish futureobjectives.
International stores are generally open 60 to 75hours per week, seven days a week. A typical store is staffed by a general manager, several department sales managers, a customer service manager, and 48 to 95 full-time staff associates, as well as part-time associates. The number of full-time staff associates is dependent upon store size, sales volume and store brand.
Narrative Description of Business Merchandise U.S. Best Buy U.S. Best Buy stores offer merchandise in four product categories: consumer electronics, home office, entertainment software and appliances. Consumer electronics, the largest product category for fiscal 2004 based on revenue, consists of video and audio products. Video products include televisions, digital cameras, DVD players, digital camcorders and digital broadcast satellite systems. Audio products include car stereos, shelf systems and speakers, home theater audio systems, portable audio equipment, audio components and mobile electronics. The home office category includes desktop and notebook computers and related peripheral equipment, telephones, cellular telephones and MP3 players. Entertainment software products include DVD movies, video game hardware and software, compact discs and computer software. The appliance category includes major appliances as well as vacuums, small electrics and housewares.
The following table presents U.S. Best Buy stores' revenue, by product category, as a percentage of total U.S. Best Buy stores' revenue: Product Category Percentage of Total Revenue Fiscal 2004 Percentage of Total Revenue Fiscal 2003 Percentage of Total Revenue Fiscal 2002 Consumer Electronics 36 % 37 % 35 % Home Office 35 % 34 % 35 % Entertainment Software 23 % 23 % 23 % Appliances 6 % 6 % 7 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Magnolia Audio Video Magnolia Audio Video stores offer merchandise in two product categories: consumer electronics and home office. Consumer electronics, the largest product category for fiscal 2004 based on revenue, consists of video and audio products. Video products include televisions, DVD players, digital cameras, digital camcorders, mobile video, digital broadcast satellite systems and video accessories.
7 Audio products include home receivers and amplifiers, home speakers, shelf systems, portable audio equipment, audio accessories, car stereos and car security systems. The home office category includes furniture, telephones and wireless communication devices.

Home office, the largest product category for fiscal 2004 based on revenue, includes desktop and notebook computers and related peripheral equipment, telephones, wireless communication devices and personal digital assistants. The consumer electronics category consists of video and audio products. Video products include televisions, digital cameras, DVD players, digital camcorders and digital broadcast satellite systems. Audio products include car stereos, portable audio equipment, home theater audio systems, audio components, shelf systems and speakers. Entertainment software products include video game hardware and software, DVD movies, computer software and compact discs. The appliance category includes major appliances as well as vacuums, small electrics and housewares. Canadian Best Buy stores do not carry appliances.
Although the two store brands of our International segment carry similar product categories, there are differences in product brands and depth of selection within product categories. On average, approximately 40percent of the product assortment (excluding entertainment software) overlaps between the two store brands.
The following table presents International revenue, by product category, as a percentage of total International revenue: Product Category Percentage of Total Revenue Fiscal 2004 Percentage of Total Revenue Fiscal 2003 Percentage of Total Revenue Fiscal 2002 (1) Home Office 41 % 42 % 42 % Consumer Electronics 39 % 38 % 37 % Entertainment Software 16 % 15 % 17 % Appliances 4 % 5 % 4 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Subsequent to the date of acquisition, November4, 2001 Distribution U.S. Best Buy Generally, U.S. Best Buy stores' merchandise, except for major appliances and large-screen televisions, is shipped directly from manufacturers to our seven distribution centers located in California, Georgia, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma and Virginia. Major appliances and 8 large-screen televisions are shipped to satellite warehouses in each major market. U.S. Best Buy stores are dependent upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment of most merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected products and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to the stores from manufacturers and distributors. On average, U.S. Best Buy stores receive product shipments two or three times a week depending on sales volume. Generally, e-commerce merchandise sales are either picked up at U.S. Best Buy retail stores or fulfilled through our distribution centers. We also operate a dedicated distribution center in Indiana for U.S. Best Buy stores' entertainment software.
We believe our current distribution centers and the relocation of the Oklahoma distribution center to a larger facility in fiscal 2005 will accommodate our expansion plans for U.S. Best Buy stores for the next several years.
Magnolia Audio Video Magnolia Audio Video stores' merchandise is received and warehoused at either a distribution center in Kent, Washington, a regional warehouse in Hayward, California, or a Best Buy distribution center in Dinuba, California. All inventory is bar coded and scanned to ensure accurate tracking. In addition, a computerized inventory replenishment program is used to maintain optimal inventory levels at each retail store. Merchandise is delivered to retail stores an average of three times each week pursuant to an in-house distribution system. We believe our current distribution centers will accommodate our Magnolia Audio Video stores' operations for the next several years.
International Our International stores' merchandise, except for appliances, is shipped directly from suppliers to distribution centers in British Columbia and Ontario. The majority of appliance sales are delivered by third-party distributors. Our International stores are dependent upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment of most merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected products and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to the stores from manufacturers and distributors. Our International stores typically receive product shipments twice a week, with accelerated shipments during periods of high sales volume. Contract carriers ship merchandise from the distribution centers to retail stores. We believe our current distribution centers and the expansion of the Ontario distribution center during fiscal 2005 will accommodate our expansion plans for our International stores for the next several years.
Suppliers Our strategy depends, in part, upon our ability to offer customers a broad selection of name-brand products and, therefore, our success is dependent upon satisfactory and stable supplier relationships. For fiscal 2004, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for nearly three-fifths of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers  Sony, Hewlett-Packard, Toshiba, Universal Music and Video Distribution, and Samsung  representing more than one-third of total merchandise purchased. The loss of or disruption in supply from any one of these major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our major suppliers. We have no indication that any of our suppliers will discontinue selling us merchandise. We have not experienced significant difficulty in maintaining satisfactory sources of supply, and we generally expect that adequate sources of supply will continue to exist for the types of merchandise sold in our stores. In fiscal 2004, we opened a global sourcing office in Shanghai, China, in order to purchase products directly from Asian manufacturers. We expect thisoffice will allow us to increase our efficiency and provide us with the capability to offer private-label products that fill gaps in our existing productassortment.
9 Store Development The addition of new stores has played, and we believe will continue to play in the future, a significant role in our growth and success. Our store development program focuses on entering new markets; adding stores within existing markets; and relocating, remodeling and/or expanding existing stores. During fiscal 2004, we opened 78 new stores and remodeled, relocated or expanded an additional 13 stores. While many of the new stores opened in fiscal 2004 were in existing markets, others were in new markets, including the opening of Canadian Best Buy stores in Alberta and Manitoba, our first such stores outside the Greater Toronto area.

Most of the new stores will be opened in markets where we already have stores, leveraging our infrastructure and making shopping more convenient for our customers. Included in the 73 stores are approximately 60 U.S. Best Buy stores, including our first store in Hawaii. We also anticipate opening 10 Best Buy stores in Canada, including our first such stores in Calgary, Alberta; Regina, Saskatchewan; and Langley, British Columbia, and additional stores in the Greater Toronto area. Finally, we anticipate opening three new Future Shop stores, as well as relocating four existing Future Shop stores.
Additional information regarding our "Outlook for Fiscal 2005" is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Intellectual Property We believe we own valuable intellectual property including trademarks and tradenames some of which, including "Best Buy," the "Yellow Tag" logo, "Future Shop," and "Magnolia Audio Video," are of material importance to our business. Our intellectual property is the subject of numerous United States and foreign trademark and service mark registrations. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of the Company, our stores and our Web sites. We are not aware of any facts that could negatively impact our continuing use of any of our intellectual property.
In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), our balance sheets only include the cost of acquired intellectual property. The only material acquired intellectual property presently included in our balance sheets is the Future Shop tradename, which had a carrying value of $37million at the end of fiscal 2004. The value of the Future Shop tradename is based on the continuation of the Future Shop brand in Canada and currently is considered an indefinite-lived intangible asset. If we ever were to abandon the Future Shop brand, we would incur an impairment charge based on the then-carrying value of the Future Shop tradename.
Seasonality Our revenue and earnings are typically greater during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday selling season.
11 Working Capital We fund the growth of our business through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities.
Additional information on our "Liquidity and Capital Resources" is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Customers During fiscal 2004, we had an average of over 1.5million customer visits to our retail stores per day. We do not have a significant concentration of sales with any individual customer and, therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material impact on our business. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our totalrevenue.
Backlog Our retail stores and online shopping sites do not have a material amount of backlog orders.
Government Contracts No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government.
Competition The consumer electronics retail industry is highly competitive. Our stores compete against other consumer electronics retailers, specialty home office retailers, mass merchants, home improvement superstores and a growing number of direct-to-consumer alternatives. Our stores also compete against independent dealers, regional chain discount stores, wholesale clubs, video rental stores and other specialty retail stores. Mass merchants continue to increase their assortment of consumer electronics products  primarily those that are less complex to sell, install and operate. Similarly, large home improvement retailers are expanding their assortment of appliances. In addition, consumers are increasingly downloading entertainment and computer software directly via the Internet.
We compete principally on the basis of customer service; installation and support services; store environment, location and convenience; product assortment and availability; value pricing; and financing alternatives. In addition, we believe our complementary e-commerce operations have effectively positioned us to meet successfully current and future competitive challenges.
We believe our store formats and brand marketing strategies differentiate us from most competitors by positioning our retail stores as the destination for new technology and entertainment products in a fun and informative shopping environment. Our stores compete by aggressively advertising and emphasizing a complete product and service solution, value pricing and financing alternatives. In addition, our trained and knowledgeable sales and service staffs allow us to tailor the product and service offerings to meet the needs of ourcustomers.
Research and Development We have not engaged in any material research and development activities during the past three fiscal years.
Environmental Matters We are not aware of any federal, state or local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that will materially affect our net earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict with certainty the potential effect on our operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations. During fiscal 2004, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated.
Number of Employees At the end of fiscal 2004, we employed approximately 100,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees in our operations. We 12 consider our employee relations to be good. There are currently no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees, andwe have not experienced a strike or workstoppage.

U.S. Best Buy stores were serviced by the following distribution centers at the end of fiscal2004: Location Square Footage Owned or Leased Dinuba, California 1,028,000 Owned Findlay, Ohio 1,010,000 Leased Nichols, New York (1) 720,000 Owned Franklin, Indiana (entertainment software) (2) 714,000 Owned Staunton, Virginia 701,000 Leased Dublin, Georgia 638,000 Owned Ardmore, Oklahoma (3) 566,000 Owned Bloomington, Minnesota 425,000 Leased Total 5,802,000 Note: We re-measured the square footage of all distribution centers in fiscal 2004.
(1) The New York distribution center was opened during the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
(2) The distribution of entertainment software to certain U.S. Best Buy stores previously performed by our former Edina, Minnesota, distribution center was transitioned to our Indiana distribution center during fiscal 2004. Following the completion of the transition of this service to the Franklin distribution center, and coinciding with the expiration of the lease of the Edina distribution center, we vacated the Edina facility.
(3) We broke ground on a new 720,000-square-foot distribution center in Ardmore, Oklahoma, during fiscal 2004. The distribution center will be located north of the existing location in Ardmore and will be owned. The new distribution center is scheduled to open in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The existing facility is being replaced in order to meet the expected increased demand for technology products and services. The new facility is expected to serve approximately 98 U.S. Best Buy stores in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas when it initially opens and will have the ability to serve up to 125 U.S. Best Buystores.
We lease space in 13 satellite warehouses in major metropolitan markets for home delivery of major appliances and large-screen televisions. U.S. Best Buy stores utilize approximately 2.5million square feet in these warehouses.
Effective March31, 2003, we moved our principal corporate offices to Richfield, Minnesota. The new, owned corporate campus consists of four interconnected buildings totaling approximately 1.5million square feet. We continue to own two facilities in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, aggregating approximately 540,000 square feet, which previously served as our principal corporate offices. These two facilities are currently for sale. At the end of fiscal 2004, we also leased approximately 260,000 square feet of additional office space in close proximity to our corporatecampus.
Magnolia Audio Video At the end of fiscal 2004, we operated 22 Magnolia Audio Video stores totaling approximately 218,000 retail square feet.
We lease an 80,000-square-foot distribution, warehouse and office facility in Kent, Washington, of which approximately 54,000 square feet are used for distribution and warehouse operations, with the remainder dedicated to a service department and corporate administrative functions. In addition, we utilize a 13,000-square-foot leased regional warehouse in Hayward, California, and 45,000 square feet of the Best Buy distribution center in Dinuba, California.
International Segment At the end of fiscal 2004, we operated 108 Future Shop stores and 19 Canadian Best Buy stores totaling approximately 2.8million retail squarefeet.
The operations of the International segment are serviced by two distribution centers located in Langley, British Columbia, and Brampton, Ontario. The distribution center in British Columbia is owned, while the distribution center in Ontario is leased. Merchandise, other than appliances, is distributed from these two distribution centers, which are 413,000 square feet and 434,000 square 15 feet, respectively. Appliance sales in western Canada are fulfilled by the distribution center in British Columbia; however, a third-party distributor is used to warehouse appliances in Alberta and Ontario and to ship appliances to all parts of Canada other than British Columbia.
In fiscal 2004, the British Columbia distribution center replaced a previously leased distribution center in Delta, British Columbia. We expect to expand the Ontario distribution center to 978,000 square feet by the end of fiscal 2005.
Corporate offices for the International segment are located in a 141,000-square-foot leased facility in Burnaby, British Columbia.
Global Sourcing Office In September2003, we opened our first global sourcing office, located in Shanghai, China. At the end of fiscal 2004, we leased office space in China totaling approximately 12,000 square feet.
Operating Leases Essentially all of our retail stores and a majority of our distribution facilities are leased. Terms of the lease agreements generally range up to 20years. Most of the leases contain renewal options and escalationclauses.
Additional information regarding operating leases is available in Note7, Lease Commitments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
We have been served with four purported class action lawsuits on behalf of persons who purchased the securities of Best Buy Co.,Inc. between January9, 2002, and August7, 2002. Thelawsuits, instituted in U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota on November20, December12, December16 and December23, 2003, name Best Buy Co.,Inc., its Chairman and its Chief Executive Officer as defendants. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making material misrepresentations between January9, 2002, and August7, 2002, which resulted in artificially inflated prices of the Company's common stock. The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, costs and expenses. We believe the allegations are without merit and intend to defend these actions vigorously.
We also have been served with a shareholder derivative action venued in Hennepin County, State of Minnesota District Court. This case raises many factual matters similar to those raised in the federal securities law cases, described above. The state court action alleges violations of state law relative to fiduciary responsibilities, control and management of the Company and unjust enrichment. The plaintiffs seek judgment in favor of the Company against certain named officer and director defendants for damages, equitable relief and attorneys' fees, costs and expenses. By agreement between the parties, and with Court approval, this case was put on inactive status. Based on the Company's information and belief, the claims against the named officer and director defendants are without merit and will be vigorously defended.
We are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of conducting business. The resolution of those proceedings is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operation or financial condition.

We have purchased and retired 4.6million shares at a cost of $200million since the inception of the share repurchase program in fiscal 2000. We consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among other things, our cash needs and the market price of the stock. At the end of fiscal 2004, $200million of the $400million originally authorized by the Company's Board of Directors was available for future share repurchases. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, critical accounting policies and the future impact of accounting standards that have been issued but are not yet effective. Our MD&A is presented in 20 nine sections: Overview, Strategic Initiatives, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations, Critical Accounting Policies, New Accounting Standards, Quarterly Results and Seasonality, and Outlook for Fiscal 2005. We believe it is useful to read our MD&A in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Overview Best Buy Co.,Inc. is a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home-office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services, with fiscal 2004 revenue of $24.5billion. We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations of U.S. Best Buy and Magnolia Audio Video. U.S. Best Buy stores offer a wide variety of consumer electronics, home-office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services, operating 608 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia as of the end of fiscal 2004. Magnolia Audio Video stores offer high-end audio and video products from 22 stores located in California, Washington and Oregon as of the end of fiscal 2004. Magnolia Audio Video was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.
The International segment was established in connection with our acquisition of Future Shop in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. At the end of fiscal 2004, the International segment consisted of 108 Future Shop stores operating throughout all Canadian provinces and 19 Canadian Best Buy stores operating in Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba. Future Shop and Canadian Best Buy stores offer products similar to those offered by U.S. BestBuystores.
In support of our retail store operations, we also operate Geek Squad, a provider of in-home computer repair and service, Web sites for each brand (BestBuy.com, BestBuyCanada.ca, FutureShop.ca, MagnoliaAV.com and GeekSquad.com), as well as an outlet store oneBay.
Sale of Musicland Business On June16, 2003, we sold our interest in Musicland to an affiliate of Sun Capital PartnersInc. The affiliate of Sun Capital PartnersInc. assumed all of Musicland's liabilities, including approximately $500million in lease obligations, in exchange for all of the capital stock of Musicland, and paid no cash consideration. The transaction also resulted in the transfer of all of Musicland's assets, other than a distribution center in Franklin, Indiana, and selected nonoperating assets. The sale of our interest in Musicland resulted in an after-tax loss on the disposal of discontinued operations totaling $66million. In connection with the sale, Musicland is purchasing transition support services from us for up to one year from the date of the sale, until Musicland is able to develop long-term providers for these services.
We acquired the common stock of Musicland Stores Corporation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The original strategy behind our Musicland acquisition was to bring Best Buy's core competencies in retailing consumer electronics to new consumer segments, including segments typically underserved by our Best Buy stores. Musicland's mall-based stores and rural market locations gave us access to more young people and more rural communities. In addition, we believed integrating certain administrative and support functions within our existing infrastructure could increase the overall profitability of the Musicland business. However, for a number of reasons, the Musicland business did not meet our financial objectives. First, Musicland was not as successful as we hoped in selling digital products, even at Best Buy prices, because many consumers assumed that products sold in a mall-based environment were not price-competitive. Second, we did not anticipate such steep and protracted declines in sales of prerecorded music or significant declines in mall traffic. Third, Musicland reduced the assortment of CDs at its stores resulting in the loss of some core customers (a 21 similar move at our Best Buy stores resulted in increased inventory turns and profits). Fourth, Musicland was successful in introducing DVD movies and video gaming at Sam Goody stores; however, these products carry a lower gross profit rate than CDs and did not provide incremental profits sufficient to make the Musicland business viable.
The sale of our interest in Musicland allows us to focus on our core business, which is our primary growth and profit driver.
For additional information regarding discontinued operations, see the "Discontinued Operations" section included in this MD&A, and refer to Note2, Discontinued Operations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Unless otherwise noted, the remainder of this MD&A relates only to results from continuing operations. All periods presented reflect the classification of Musicland's financial results as discontinued operations.
Strategic Initiatives Our vision is to make life fun and easy for consumers. Our business strategy is to bring technology and consumers together in a retail environment that focuses on educating consumers on the features and benefits of technology and entertainment, while maximizing our overall profitability. We believe our stores offer consumers meaningful advantages in store environment, product value, product selection and customer service, all of which advance our objectives of enhancing our business model, gaining market share and improving profitability. As of the end of fiscal 2004, we operated 757 retail stores, including Best Buy stores in the United States and Canada; Future Shop stores in Canada; and Magnolia Audio Video stores in the United States. We also operate Web sites for each brand and an outlet store on eBay.
During fiscal 2004, we advanced four strategic initiatives that we believe will further enhance our business model over the next several years. The four strategic initiatives are:  Customer Centricity  Efficient Enterprise  Win the Home with Service  Win in Entertainment Customer Centricity Our customers are at the core of all of our business strategies, and our customer centricity initiative is the most important of our four strategic initiatives. In short, customer centricity means winning with the customer. The customer centricity initiative includes identifying profitable customer segments, tailoring our store experience to satisfy their needs, and training our employees to think and behave as owner/operators. We believe that we can extend our competitive advantage by engaging more fully with our customers, offering them broader and deeper assortments than our competitors, and supporting their shopping experiences with a full array of services. Our goal is to maximize every customer touch point, including store visits, phone calls, online visits and in-home visits.
During fiscal 2004, we tested our customer centricity platform at 32 of our existing U.S. Best Buy stores by focusing on five specific customer segments. These stores collectively led the Company in terms of comparable store sales gains for fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, we plan to develop a strategy for scaling customer centricity, based on the customer segments with the highest return on invested capital, and then expand this initiative by converting up to 110 additional existing U.S. Best Buy stores. In addition, during fiscal 2004 we launched Reward Zone, a customer loyalty program through which customers earn award certificates based on purchases. The program attracted more than 2.5million members in fiscal 2004, and we expect to gain valuable customer insights from this program in the future.
Efficient Enterprise The purpose of our efficient enterprise initiative is to reduce our cost structure, increase our speed to 22 market and improve the returns we achieve on our capital investments. Ultimately, we have a goal of increasing our operating income rate to 7% of revenue by fiscal 2007, while continuing to deliver double-digit revenue growth.
We improved our operating income rate by 0.5% of revenue for fiscal 2004 to 5.3% of revenue, reflecting leverage associated with a strong comparable store sales gain, the opening of new stores and efficient enterprise initiatives. For example, we increased productivity and lowered the cost of building new stores. In the coming year, we plan to implement changes to our corporate and field organizations in order to prepare for customer centricity and boost productivity. To support our customer centricity initiative, we are changing from a culture of Standard Operating Platforms to a culture of Adaptive Operating Platforms. This change requires us to increase the agility and flexibility of our internal processes. We also plan to explore the increased use of third-party vendors to improve our capabilities while reducing costs.
Win the Home with Service Our customers' technology needs are becoming more complex with the rapid development of new products. In addition, consumers wish to manage their movies, music, photographs and games centrally and to access them through multiple devices throughout their home. Our win the home with service initiative focuses on creating a market-leadership position in delivering lifestyle-based solutions for our customers. We are committed to selling, installing and supporting technologies that create an integrated digital home. We believe this approach will differentiate us from many of our competitors who sell technology products, but do not provide installation and support services. Our goal is to create a life-long relationship with our customers and deliver to them a broad product selection, home integration capabilities, service and technology upgrades.
We expanded the Geek Squad, our 24-hour rapid response computer support task force, to a total of seven markets during fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, we plan to roll out this service to a majority of our U.S. Best Buy stores. Our goal is to make the Geek Squad North America's largest provider of in-home computer repair and installation services. We also plan to integrate this service with the existing computer support staff in our stores, who will be given additional training and re-branded with the Geek Squad logo. We also intend to expand our in-home integration services and to explore additional opportunities within the services industry.
Win in Entertainment Our fourth strategic initiative is focused on gaining market share in the rapidly changing entertainment category. This category includes music, movies, video game hardware and software, computer software, subscriptions and other related products. The development and delivery of entertainment products have undergone significant changes in recent years. Our win in entertainment initiative includes supporting the development and delivery of new entertainment-related products through multiple distribution channels and increasing our market share. We want to be the consumer's preferred choice when purchasing entertainment products.
In support of this initiative, we increased our CD in-stock levels in fiscal 2004 and modestly increased the amount of labor in our music departments. We also introduced new entertainment products, including online entertainment services and magazine subscriptions. Finally, we offered an exclusive DVD from the Rolling Stones. We believe we gained market share in entertainment as a result of these efforts. In fiscal 2005, we anticipate continuing to enhance our entertainment assortments and to pursue exclusive arrangements.
Results of Operations Fiscal 2004 Summary  Earnings from continuing operations increased 29% to $800million, or $2.44 per diluted share, compared with $622million, or $1.91 per diluted share, for fiscal 2003. The increase in earnings from continuing operations was driven by an increase in revenue, including a comparable 23 store sales gain of 7.1%; an improved gross profit rate; and a decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)rate.
Revenue increased 17% to $24.5billion, compared with $20.9billion for the prior fiscal year. The increase reflected market share gains and was driven by the addition of 78 new stores in the past 12months, a full of year of revenue from stores added in fiscal 2003, a 7.1% comparable store sales increase and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Our gross profit rate increased 0.2% of revenue to 25.2% of revenue, up from 25.0% of revenue for fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to gross profit rate improvements within our product categories and a more effective use of promotions in the Domestic segment compared with the prior fiscal year. These factors were partially offset by costs associated with Reward Zone, our customer loyalty program introduced during the second quarter of fiscal 2004; the increase of the home office category in the revenue mix, as that product category carries a lower gross profit rate; and a more promotional environment in the International segment compared with the prior fiscal year.
Our SG&A rate declined 0.3% of revenue to 19.9% of revenue, down from 20.2% of revenue for the prior fiscal year. The SG&A rate improvement was primarily due to expense leverage from the 7.1% comparable store sales gain and the addition of 78 new stores, and the realization of cost savings from our efficient enterprise initiative. Our fiscal 2004 SG&A rate also benefited from a one-time gain associated with the sale of stock received in connection with a vendor co-marketing agreement. These factors were partially offset by increased performance-based incentive compensation as a result of our improved year-over-year financial performance and restricted stock grants awarded pursuant to our new long-term incentive compensation program. Other offsetting factors included spending on our customer centricity initiative, reduced funding from vendor alliance programs and technology asset impairment charges.
In October2003, our Board of Directors declared the Company's first-ever cash dividends, including a special dividend of $0.30 per share of outstanding common stock, and the initiation of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of outstanding common stock. During fiscal 2004, we made two dividend payments of approximately $130million in theaggregate.
Also in October2003, we announced our intent to resume purchasing shares of our common stock pursuant to the $400million share repurchase program authorized by the Company's Board of Directors in fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2004, we purchased and retired 1.8million shares at a cost of $100million.

(1) As-adjusted data conforms the accounting for vendor allowances to the method adopted in fiscal 2003 and is reflected as if Future Shop had been acquired at the beginning of fiscal 2002. As-adjusted data is unaudited.
(2) Comprised of revenue at stores and Internet sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of acquisition. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage change excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we refined our methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage change. It now reflects the impact of non-point-of-sale (non-POS) revenue transactions. We refined our comparable store sales calculation methodology in light of changes in our business. Previously, our comparable store sales calculation was based on store POS revenue. The comparable store sales change for fiscal 2004 has been computed based on the refined methodology. The comparable store sales changes for prior fiscal years have not been computed using the refined methodology. Refining the methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage change did not impact previously reported revenue, earnings or cash flows.
Continuing Operations Fiscal 2004 Results Compared With Fiscal 2003 Earnings from continuing operations were $800million for fiscal 2004, or $2.44 per diluted share, a 29% increase from $622million, or $1.91 per diluted share, for fiscal 2003. The increase in earnings from continuing operations was primarily driven by an increase in revenue, including a comparable store sales gain of 7.1%, and improvements in both our gross profit rate and our SG&A rate.
Revenue for fiscal 2004 increased 17% to $24.5billion, compared with $20.9billion for fiscal 2003. The revenue increase resulted from the addition of 60 U.S. Best Buy, 11 Canadian Best Buy, four Future Shop and three Magnolia Audio Video stores in the past 12months; a full year of revenue from new stores added in fiscal 2003; and a 7.1% comparable store sales gain. The addition of new stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for approximately half of the revenue increase for fiscal 2004; the comparable store sales gain accounted for approximately two-fifths of the revenue increase for the current fiscal year; and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for the remainder of the revenue increase. The fiscal 2004 comparable store sales gain was driven by an improved economic environment, including increased consumer 25 confidence, demand for digital products and effective advertising and promotional campaigns. These factors led to higher customer traffic in our stores and contributed to our market share gains during fiscal 2004. Products having the largest impact on our fiscal 2004 comparable store sales gain included computers, digital televisions, digital cameras and accessories, DVD movies, MP3 players, CDs and digital camcorders. The increase in computers reflects market share gains as well as customers' increased desire to upgrade their home computers for managing their music, movies, photos and games. The increase in digital products reflects the continued consumer migration to, and increased affordability of, digitalproducts.
Our gross profit rate improved to 25.2% of revenue for fiscal 2004, a 0.2% of revenue increase compared with 25.0% of revenue for fiscal 2003. The increase in the gross profit rate was primarily due to gross profit rate improvements within our product categories and a more effective use of promotions in the Domestic segment compared with the prior fiscal year. The improvements in the gross profit rates within our product categories resulted from specific initiatives, including reducing markdowns, improving product assortments and developing more effective promotions. These factors were partially offset by costs associated with Reward Zone, our new customer loyalty program, and the increase of the home office category in the revenue mix, as that product category carries a lower gross profit rate. We also experienced a more promotional environment in the International segment compared with fiscal 2003.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, we launched Reward Zone, our new customer loyalty program. At the end of fiscal 2004, we had more than 2.5million Reward Zone members. Under the terms of the program, members earn points for each qualifying purchase completed at U.S. Best Buy stores. After accumulating the required point total, members are awarded a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases. Certificates awarded to Reward Zone members expire 90days after issuance. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.00-22, Accounting for "Points" and Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based Sales Incentive Offers, and Offers for Free Products or Services to Be Delivered in the Future , the value of points earned by Reward Zone members are recorded as a liability and a reduction of revenue. The value of points earned by our loyalty program members are included as a liability and a reduction of revenue at the time the points are earned based on the percentage of points that are projected to be redeemed. The value of points earned by Reward Zone members reduced fiscal 2004 gross profit and operating income by approximately 0.3% of revenue. Revenue, gross profit rates and earnings in future periods will continue to reflect points earned, adjusted for our actual redemption experience.
Because we do not include all costs of our distribution facilities in cost of goods sold, our gross profit and gross profit rate may not be comparable to those of other retailers that include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of goods sold and in the calculation of grossprofit.
Our SG&A rate decreased 0.3% of revenue to 19.9% of revenue for fiscal 2004, compared with 20.2% of revenue for fiscal 2003. The decrease in the SG&A rate was primarily due to expense leverage (as revenue increased at a faster rate than operating expenses) from the 7.1% comparable store sales gain and the addition of 78 new stores, and the realization of cost savings from our efficient enterprise initiative. Our fiscal 2004 SG&A rate also benefited from a one-time gain of approximately $5million, before tax, associated with the sale of stock received in connection with a vendor co-marketing agreement. In addition, our fiscal 2004 SG&A rate benefited from the absence of certain costs incurred during fiscal 2003, including lease termination and asset impairment charges associated with vacating our previous corporate facilities in connection with the relocation to our new corporate campus, as well as various expenses in our International segment to support 26 strategic initiatives, including the launch of Best Buy stores in Canada and outside consulting expenses intended to improve the future efficiency and profitability of our International segment. These factors were partially offset by increased performance-based incentive compensation as a result of our improved year-over-year financial performance and restricted stock grants awarded pursuant to our new long-term incentive compensation program, as well as spending on our customer centricity initiative. Other offsetting factors included reduced funding received from vendor alliance programs and technology asset impairment charges.
In August2003, we launched a new long-term incentive program for approximately 2,300 U.S. employees designed to help us attract and retain the best employees and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders. The new program is expected to result in less shareholder dilution for existing shareholders. Under the terms of the new program, which began in November2003, eligible employees received a mix of restricted stock and stock options. Shares of restricted stock vest at the end of a three-year incentive period based on our total return to shareholders compared with companies that comprise the S&P 500 over the same three-year period. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , compensation expense under the new program is recognized each reporting period based on the number of shares expected to ultimately vest, our stock price and the vesting period. For fiscal 2004, we recognized $5million, before tax, in compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards granted pursuant to the new long-term incentive program. Stock options issued pursuant to the long-term incentive program are also accounted for in accordance with APB Opinion No.25, consistent with the accounting treatment for stock options previously granted pursuant to our stock option plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for stock options as the exercise price equals the stock price on the date of grant.
Fiscal 2003 Results Compared With Fiscal 2002 As-Adjusted The discussion and analysis of fiscal 2003 results compared with fiscal 2002 results as-adjusted conforms the accounting for vendor allowances to the method adopted in fiscal 2003 and reflects Future Shop as if it had been acquired at the beginning of fiscal 2002. As-adjusted information is unaudited.
Earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2003 increased 10% to $622million, or $1.91 per diluted share, compared with $564million, or $1.75 per diluted share, for fiscal 2002 on an as-adjusted basis. The increase in earnings from continuing operations was primarily driven by a 13% increase in revenue and a slight improvement in the gross profit rate, partially offset by a higher SG&A rate.
Fiscal 2003 revenue increased to $20.9billion, compared with fiscal 2002 as-adjusted revenue of $18.5billion. Approximately four-fifths of the increase in revenue for fiscal 2003 was due to the opening of 67 U.S. Best Buy, eight Canadian Best Buy and nine Future Shop stores during fiscal 2003, and a full year of revenue from new stores opened in fiscal 2002. The remainder of the increase was due to the 2.4% comparable store sales gain.
Our gross profit rate for fiscal 2003 increased slightly to 25.0% of revenue, versus 24.9% of revenue for the prior fiscal year on an as-adjusted basis. The improvement in the gross profit rate was primarily due to selling a more profitable revenue mix at U.S. Best Buy stores, including increased revenue from higher-margin digital products, partially offset by a more promotional environment in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal2002.
Our SG&A rate was 20.2% of revenue for fiscal 2003, an increase of 0.2% of revenue over the prior fiscal year's as-adjusted rate of 20.0% of revenue. The increase in the SG&A rate was primarily due to increased expenses in our International segment to support strategic initiatives, including the launch of Best Buy stores in Canada and outside consulting expenses 27 intended to improve the future efficiency and profitability of our International segment. The SG&A rate also increased due to the deleveraging effect of a modest comparable store sales increase, as operating expenses increased at a faster rate than comparable store sales. In addition, the SG&A rate was negatively impacted by higher consulting expenses, increased depreciation expenses related to technology investments, and lease termination and asset impairment charges associated with vacating existing corporate facilities in connection with the relocation to our new corporate campus in fiscal 2004. The increase in the SG&A rate was partially offset by expense-saving initiatives implemented in the second half of fiscal 2003, reduced performance-based incentive compensation and expense leverage from opening new stores in existing markets.
Segment Performance Domestic The following table presents selected financial data for the Domestic segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): Segment Performance Summary (unaudited) 2004 2003 As-Adjusted 2002 (1) 2002 Revenue $ 22,225 $ 19,303 $ 17,115 $ 17,115 Comparable stores sales % change (2) 7.4 % 2.4 % 1.9 % 1.9 % Gross profit as a % of revenue 25.3 % 25.0 % 24.9 % 21.2 % SG&A as a % of revenue 19.6 % 19.8 % 19.8 % 16.0 % Operating income $ 1,267 $ 1,002 $ 876 $ 886 Operating income as a % of revenue 5.7 % 5.2 % 5.1 % 5.2 % Note: All periods presented reflect the classification of Musicland's financial results as discontinued operations.

The comparable store sales changes for prior fiscal years have not been computed using the refined methodology. Refining the methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage change did not impact previously reported revenue, earnings or cash flows.
Domestic operating income increased 27% to $1.3billion, or 5.7% of revenue, for fiscal 2004, compared with $1.0billion, or 5.2% of revenue, for fiscal 2003. The improvement in the Domestic segment operating income rate for fiscal 2004 was driven by revenue gains, including a 7.4% comparable store sales increase; an improvement in the gross profit rate of 0.3% of revenue; and a decrease in the SG&A rate of 0.2% of revenue.
Domestic revenue increased to $22.2billion for fiscal 2004, a 15% increase over fiscal 2003 revenue of $19.3billion. Slightly more than half of the revenue increase for fiscal 2004 was due to new stores added in the past two fiscal years. The remainder of the revenue increase for fiscal 2004 was attributable to the 7.4% comparable store sales gain.
Our fiscal 2004 comparable store sales gain was driven by an improved economic environment, including increased consumer confidence; demand for, and increased affordability of, digital products; and effective advertising and promotional strategies, all of which led to higher customer traffic in our stores and on our Web sites. These factors also contributed to our market share gains during fiscal 2004. The home office, consumer 28 electronics and entertainment software product categories experienced comparable store sales gains for fiscal 2004, while appliances posted a modest decline in comparable store sales. The home office category posted a low double-digit comparable store sales gain for the fiscal year primarily driven by sales of personal computers, MP3 players and computer networking products, partially offset by softer sales of PDAs, computer accessories and scanners. The increase in revenue from notebook computers and computer networking products reflects customers' growing preference for portability, while the increase in desktop computers reflects customers' increased desire to upgrade their home computers. A mid-single-digit comparable store sales gain in the consumer electronics category was primarily driven by sales of digital televisions, digital cameras and digital camcorders, reflecting continued consumer migration to, and increased affordability of, digital products, partially offset by declines in sales of analog televisions and camcorders, as well as VCRs. The entertainment software category also had a mid-single-digit comparable store sales gain for fiscal 2004, fueled by new-releases and our improved assortments in both DVD movies and CDs, partially offset by a double-digit comparable store sales decline in video game hardware. Despite improving trends in appliances throughout fiscal 2004, the category posted a modest comparable store sales decline for the fiscal year. Increased assortments in higher-end laundry products, refrigerators and dishwashers, as well as effective promotions in the second half of fiscal 2004, were more than offset by softer sales during the first half of fiscal 2004.
The Domestic gross profit rate increased to 25.3% of revenue for fiscal 2004, an improvement of 0.3% of revenue compared with 25.0% of revenue for the prior fiscal year. The increase in the gross profit rate was primarily due to gross profit rate improvements within our product categories and a more effective use of promotions compared with the prior fiscal year. The improvements in the gross profit rates within our product categories resulted from specific initiatives, including reducing markdowns, improving product assortments and developing more effective promotions. These factors were partially offset by costs associated with Reward Zone and the increase of the home office category in the revenue mix, as that product category carries a lower gross profit rate.
The fiscal 2004 SG&A rate for the Domestic segment was 19.6% of revenue, a decrease of 0.2% of revenue from 19.8% of revenue for the prior fiscal year. The SG&A rate benefited from expense leverage resulting from the 7.4% comparable store sales gain, the addition of 60 U.S. Best Buy stores and three Magnolia Audio Video stores in the past 12months, a full year of revenue from stores added in fiscal 2003, the realization of cost savings from our efficient enterprise initiative and a one-time gain of approximately $5million, before tax, associated with the sale of stock received in connection with a vendor co-marketing agreement. In addition, the Domestic segment's SG&A rate for fiscal 2004 also benefited from the absence of certain costs incurred during fiscal 2003, including lease termination and asset impairment charges associated with vacating our previous corporate facilities in connection with the relocation to our new corporate campus. These factors were partially offset by increased performance-based incentive compensation as a result of our improved year-over-year financial performance and restricted stock grants awarded pursuant to our new long-term incentive compensation program, reduced funding received from vendor alliance programs, expenses associated with our customer centricity initiative and technology asset impairment charges.

At the end of fiscal 2004, we operated 608 U.S. Best Buy stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia. Magnolia Audio Video opened three new stores during fiscal 2004 and operated 22 stores in California, Washington and Oregon at the end of fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, Magnolia Audio Video remodeled one store.

The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage change excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we refined our methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage change. It now reflects the impact of non-point-of-sale (non-POS) revenue transactions. We refined our comparable store sales calculation methodology in light of changes in our business. Previously, our comparable store sales calculation was based on store POS revenue. The comparable store sales change for fiscal 2004 has been computed based on the refined methodology. The comparable store sales changes for prior fiscal years have not been computed using the refined methodology. Refining the methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage change did not impact previously reported revenue, earnings or cash flows.
30 The International segment generated operating income of $37million for fiscal 2004, compared with $8million for the prior fiscal year. Approximately one-quarter of the increase in operating income for fiscal 2004 was due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The remainder of the increase in operating income was primarily due to revenue gains, including a 4.7% comparable store sales increase for the fiscal year, and an improved SG&A rate, and was partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit rate.
International revenue increased 41% to $2.3billion for fiscal 2004, compared with $1.6billion last fiscal year. The effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately half of the revenue increase for the fiscal year. New store additions in the past two fiscal years accounted for approximately two-fifths of the revenue increase, and the 4.7% comparable store sales gain accounted for the remainder. The comparable store sales gain reflected market share gains and was driven by increased revenue from digital televisions, digital cameras, DVD movies and notebook computers.
The International gross profit rate was 24.3% of revenue for fiscal 2004, a decrease from 25.0% of revenue for the prior fiscal year. The decline in the gross profit rate was primarily due to increased promotional activity compared with the prior fiscal year, including higher customer financing expenses. In response to the opening of Best Buy stores in Canada, our competitors in the International segment increased their promotional offerings, resulting in additional pressure on our gross profit rate.
The SG&A rate for the International segment declined to 22.7% of revenue for fiscal 2004, compared with 24.5% of revenue for the prior fiscal year. The SG&A rate decrease for fiscal 2004 was primarily due to expense leverage resulting from new store openings and the 4.7% comparable store sales gain, as well as the absence of certain expenses incurred during fiscal 2003, including expenses associated with launching Canadian Best Buy stores and outside consulting expenses intended to improve the future efficiency and profitability of International operations. Also, the International SG&A rate was positively affected by favorable settlements related to previously established legal and location closing liabilities, which did not have a significantaffect on fiscal 2004 earnings from continuingoperations.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we completed our annual impairment testing of the goodwill and tradename recorded in our International segment. Based on expectations for the business and the prevailing retail environment, we determined that no impairment existed. However, if unanticipated events adversely impact this segment for an extended period of time, it could result in future impairment charges. In addition, the value recorded for the Future Shop tradename is based on the continuation of the Future Shop brand in Canada. If we ever were to abandon the Future Shop tradename, it would result in future impairment charges.

At the end of fiscal 2004, we operated 108 Future Shop stores throughout all Canadian provinces. We also opened 11 Canadian Best Buy stores during fiscal 2004, including our first such stores in Alberta and Manitoba. At the end of fiscal 2004, we operated 19 Canadian Best Buy stores in Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba.
Discontinued Operations For fiscal 2004, the sale of our interest in Musicland resulted in an after-tax loss on the disposal of discontinued operations totaling $66million. The results of discontinued operations for fiscal 2004 are included through the date of the sale, June16, 2003. Fiscal 2003 results from discontinued operations are for the entire fiscal year. For additional information regarding discontinued operations, refer to Note2, Discontinued Operations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
The results from discontinued operations for the past three fiscal years are as follows ($ in millions): Discontinued Operations Performance Summary (unaudited) 2004 2003 As-Adjusted 2002 (1) 2002 Revenue $ 354 $ 1,727 $ 1,886 $ 1,886 Operating (loss) income (46 ) (238 ) 31 29 Interest expense  (6 ) (20 ) (19 ) (Loss) earnings before income tax (benefit) expense (46 ) (244 ) 11 10 Income tax (benefit) expense (2) (17 ) (119 ) 11 10 Loss before loss on disposal of discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes (29 ) (125 )   Loss on disposal of discontinued operations, net of $0 tax (3) (66 )    Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net of $5 tax (4)  (316 )   Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (95 ) $ (441 ) $  $  (1) As-adjusted data conforms the accounting for vendor allowances to the method adopted in fiscal 2003.
(2) Fiscal 2003 included a $25million tax benefit resulting from the differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes at acquisition, which were expected to be realized upon the disposition of Musicland.
(3) In fiscal 2004, based on the terms of the sale of our interest in Musicland, we determined that the nature of our future taxable income may not allow us to realize the $25million deferred tax asset recorded in fiscal 2003 and have provided a full valuation allowance.
(4) In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded an after-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $308million for the full write-off of goodwill related to our acquisition of Musicland, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , which was adopted effective on March3, 2002. In addition, we recorded an after-tax, non-cash charge of $8million for the change in our method of accounting for vendor allowances in accordance with EITF No.02-16, Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor .
32 Additional Consolidated Results Net Interest (Expense) Income Net interest expense increased to $8million for fiscal 2004, compared with net interest income of $4million for fiscal 2003. The increase in net interest expense was primarily a result of the allocation of interest expense to discontinued operations for fiscal 2003. In addition, net interest expense increased approximately $4million for fiscal 2004 as a result of interest expense related to the construction of our new corporate campus that was capitalized during fiscal 2003.
Net interest income decreased to $4million for fiscal 2003, compared with $18million for fiscal 2002. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to lower yields on short-term investments and a full year of interest expense associated with convertible debentures issued during fiscal 2002.
For additional information regarding net interest (expense) income, refer to Note6, Net Interest (Expense) Income, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate decreased to 38.3% for fiscal 2004, compared with 38.7% for fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2004 was mainly due to our lower effective state income tax rate for the current fiscalyear.
Our effective income tax rate increased to 38.7% for fiscal 2003, up from 38.4% for fiscal 2002. The increase in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2003 was primarily due to increased tax expense related to our International segment and a slight increase in the effective state income tax rate.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The impact of inflation and changing prices has not been material to our revenue or earnings from continuing operations in any of the last three fiscal years. Highly competitive market conditions and the general economic environment minimized inflation's impact on the selling prices of ourproducts.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary We ended fiscal 2004 with $2.6billion of cash and cash equivalents, an increase from $1.9billion at the end of fiscal 2003. Working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, increased to $1.2billion at the end of fiscal 2004, compared with $1.1billion at the end of fiscal 2003.
Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $1.4billion for fiscal 2004, compared with $746million for fiscal 2003 and $1.5billion for fiscal 2002. The improvement in operating cash flows for fiscal 2004, compared with the prior fiscal year, was primarily due to an increase in cash provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities, as well as increased earnings from continuing operations. Earnings from continuing operations increased to $800million for fiscal 2004, compared with $622million for fiscal 2003. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were substantially due to changes in accounts payable, other liabilities and accrued income taxes, partially offset by increased merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories increased in fiscal 2004, primarily due to the addition of new stores and changes in product mix, including expanded assortments of digital televisions and notebook computers. In addition, the increased inventory levels reflected our efforts to improve in-stock positions in product categories that have been driving our revenue growth. The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the increase in inventory, the timing of vendor payments and increased business volume. Other liabilities increased primarily due to growth in the business, higher performance-based incentive compensation as a result of our improved year-over-year operating performance and increased payroll withholdings associated with our new employee stock purchase plan. Accrued income taxes increased primarily due to higher income taxes resulting from the increase in 33 earnings from continuing operations, partially offset by tax benefits resulting from the sale of our interest in Musicland.
Cash used in investing activities was $543million for fiscal 2004, compared with $659million and $924million for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, respectively. The decrease for fiscal 2004 was primarily a result of a decrease in additions to property and equipment. Refer to the "Capital Expenditures" section of this MD&A for additional information. In fiscal 2004, we used cash for the construction of new retail locations, information systems, distribution center improvements, and other additions to property and equipment, including the completion of our new corporate campus. The primary purposes of the cash investment activity were to support our expansion plans, to improve our operational efficiency and to enhance shareholder value.
Cash used in financing activities was $133million for fiscal 2004, compared with cash provided by financing activities of $45million for fiscal 2003 and $769million for fiscal 2002. The change from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the payment of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2004, partially offset by increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with our equity-based compensation programs. We made two dividend payments totaling approximately $130million during fiscal 2004. In addition, during fiscal 2004, we repurchased $100million of our common stock pursuant to the stock purchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in fiscal 2000.
Net cash used in discontinued operations was $53million for fiscal 2004, compared with $79million for fiscal 2003 and $270million for fiscal 2002. Net cash used in discontinued operations decreased for fiscal 2004, as compared with fiscal 2003, due to the sale of our interest in Musicland during the second quarter of fiscal2004.
Sources of Liquidity Funds generated by operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe funds generated from the expected results of operations and available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives for the next fiscal year. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under the revolving creditfacilities.
We have a $200million unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in March2005, of which $197million was available at February28, 2004. Outstanding letters of credit reduced the amount available under this facility. No borrowings were made under this facility during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002.
We also have inventory financing lines totaling $210million that allow us to extend the due dates of merchandise invoices beyond their normal terms. At February28, 2004, $140million was available for use under these facilities. Outstanding merchandise invoices reduced the amounts available under these facilities.
In March2004, we entered into a $19million unsecured revolving demand facility related to our International operations, of which $4million is only available on a seasonal basis from August through January of each year. This facility replaced a $41million unsecured credit facility which was cancelled on March1, 2004. There were no borrowings outstanding under the $41million facility at February28, 2004.
We offer our customers extended financing through a third-party financial institution. The use of financing encourages consumers to purchase selected products and promotes our business. The third-party institution assumes the risk of collection from our customers and has no recourse against 34 us for any uncollectible amounts. Generally, these financing offers allow customers to purchase products with repayment terms ranging from 90days to 18months without a finance charge. Our contract with the third-party financial institution extends through January2009. If the contract were to be unexpectedly terminated or canceled, we believe we could contract with an alternative third-party financial institution or directly provide our customers with extendedfinancing.
Our credit ratings as of February28, 2004, were as follows: Rating Agency Rating Outlook Fitch (1) BBB Stable Moody's Baa3 Stable Standard & Poor's (2) BBB- Stable (1) Fitch Ratings affirmed its BBB rating and Stable outlook in September2003. Fitch stated that its ratings reflected our strong customer acceptance and market share, solid operating margins and liquid balance sheet. These factors were balanced against the cyclical nature of the consumer electronics industry.
(2) Standard& Poor's Ratings Services revised its outlook to Stable from Negative in June2003. The revised outlook issued by Standard& Poor's Ratings Services reflects our divestiture of Musicland, no expected significant acquisition activity and positive comparable store sales trends.
Factors that can impact our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new store occupancy costs. In addition, the conversion rights of the holders of our convertible debentures could be accelerated if our credit ratings were to be downgraded.
Capital Expenditures A component of our long-term strategy is our capital expenditure program. This program includes, among other things, investments in new stores, store remodeling, store relocations and expansions, new distribution facilities and information technology enhancements. During fiscal 2004, we invested $545million in property and equipment, including opening 78 new stores; remodeling, relocating and/or expanding 13 stores; and improving our distribution centers and information systems. We plan to invest approximately $700million in property and equipment during fiscal 2005. We expect to open approximately 73 new stores in the United States and Canada; remodel, relocate and/or expand some of our older stores in key strategic markets; complete the construction of our new Ardmore, Oklahoma, distribution center; complete the expansion of our Brampton, Ontario, distribution center and make other infrastructure investments to support the business. Capital expenditures are funded through cash provided by operating activities, as well as available cash and cashequivalents.
Refer to the "Outlook for Fiscal 2005" section of this MD&A for additional information on our capital expenditure plans for fiscal 2005.
The following table presents our cash capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscalyears ($ in millions): Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 New stores $ 215 $ 219 $ 194 Store-related projects (1) 111 96 69 Corporate campus (2) 29 131 107 Information technology 112 185 153 Other 78 94 58 Total cash capital expenditures (3) $ 545 $ 725 $ 581 (1) Includes store remodels, relocations and/or expansions, as well as various merchandising projects.
(2) Construction of our new corporate campus was completed during fiscal 2004.
(3) Excludes cash paid for acquisitions.
Debt and Capital In fiscal 2002, we sold convertible debentures due June27, 2021, and January15, 2022, with an initial principal amount at maturity of $492million and 35 aprincipal amount of $402million, respectively. The proceeds from the offerings, net of offering expenses, were $726million. We may redeem, and holders of the debentures may require us to purchase, all or part of the debentures on certain dates or upon the occurrence of certain events as specified in the respective indentures. In addition, in the event that certain conditions are satisfied, holders may surrender their debentures for conversion, which would increase the number of shares of our common stock outstanding and have a dilutive impact on our reported earnings per share. The shares related to the convertible debentures were not included in our diluted earnings-per-share computation for fiscal 2004 or 2003, as the criteria for conversion of the debentures were not met. For additional information regarding the convertible debentures, refer to Note4, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Holders of our convertible debentures due in 2021 can require us to redeem the debentures for cash effective on June27, 2004. As a result, convertible debentures with a carrying value of $353million have been included in the current portion of long-term debt in the February28, 2004, consolidated balance sheet. At the end of fiscal 2004, the fair market value of the convertible debentures exceeded the redemption value. Therefore, we do not currently expect, subject to changes in market conditions, that holders of the convertible debentures will exercise their redemption option during fiscal 2005 and require us to purchase these debentures. However, if market conditions change and holders of our convertible debentures due in 2021 exercise their redemption option, we believe funds generated from the expected results of operations and available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance the redemption. If holders of our convertible debentures do not exercise their redemption option on June27, 2004, their next redemption opportunity will not be until June27,2009.
Our ability to access our credit facilities is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facilities, including financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth. As of the end of fiscal 2004, we were in compliance with all such covenants. In the event we were to default on any of our other debt, it would constitute a default under our credit facilities as well.
Our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to own or to lease the location and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders. For those sites developed using working capital, we often sell and lease back those properties under long-term lease agreements.
We also have a master lease program which was used for the purpose of constructing and leasing new retail locations. As of February28, 2004, $58million in leases related to new stores were outstanding under the master lease program. The master lease program is complete and there will be no further new-store development under this program. The program is set to expire on January1, 2006, and is renewable for one year, subject to the lenders' consent.
Share Repurchases and Dividends In October2003, we announced our intent to resume purchasing shares of our common stock pursuant to a $400million share repurchase program authorized by the Company's Board of Directors in fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2004, we purchased and retired 1.8million shares at a cost of $100million. No purchases were made under the stock repurchase program in either fiscal 2003 or fiscal 2002. We have purchased and retired 4.6million shares at a cost of $200million since the inception of the share repurchase program in fiscal 2000. We consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases, including among other things, our cash needs and the market price of our stock. At the end of fiscal 2004, $200million of the $400million originally authorized by the Company's Board of Directors 36 was available for future share repurchases. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases. We expect that cash provided by future operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents, will be the sources of funding for the share repurchase program.
Additional information on the share repurchase program is included in Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
In October2003, we also announced that our Board of Directors had declared the Company's first-ever cash dividends, including the initiation of a regular quarterly cash dividend. A special cash dividend payment of $0.30 per common share, or approximately $97million based on 324,804,000 common shares outstanding as of the record date, November18, 2003, was paid on December9, 2003. In addition, a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share, or approximately $33million based on 324,146,000 common shares outstanding as of the record date, January7, 2004, was paid on January28, 2004. These two dividend payments allowed the Company to begin its desired rhythm of paying $0.40 per common share each fiscal year, subject to legal and contractual restrictions. The second regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share is payable on May12, 2004, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April21, 2004. We plan to fund future dividend payments using cash provided by future operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance-sheet financing. We finance a portion of our new-store development program through sale-leaseback transactions, which involve selling stores to unrelated parties and then leasing the stores back under leases that are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with SFAS No.13, Accounting for Leases.
A summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the "Contractual Obligations" sectionbelow.
Our debt-to-capitalization ratio, which represents the ratio of total debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, to total capitalization (total debt plus total shareholders' equity), improved to 20% at February28, 2004, compared with 23% at March1, 2003. We view our debt-to-capitalization ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness. Our adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by eight), was 57% at the end of fiscal 2004, compared with 67% at the end of fiscal 2003. Total debt, including capitalized operating lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by eight), was $4.6billion at February28, 2004, compared with $5.5billion at March1, 2003.
The information presented in this Annual Report on Form10-K includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as measures that may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance withGAAP.
Our adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by eight), is not in accordance with, or preferable to, the ratio determined in accordance with GAAP. However, we have included this information as we believe that our adjusted debt-to-capitalization 37 ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by eight), is important for understanding our operations and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our long-term debt and other fixed obligations, and to fund our future growth. In addition, we believe our adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by eight), is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to retailers who own, rather than lease, their stores.
In January2003, as directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC amended Item 10 of RegulationS-K to provide additional guidance to registrants that include non-GAAP financial measures in SEC filings. The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of our adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by eight) ($ in millions): Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Total debt (current and long-term portion) (1) $ 850 $ 834 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8times rental expense) (2) 3,746 4,680 Debt (including capitalized operating lease obligations) $ 4,596 $ 5,514 Total debt (current and long-term portion) (1) $ 850 $ 834 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8times rental expense) (2) 3,746 4,680 Total shareholders' equity 3,422 2,730 Adjusted capitalization $ 8,018 $ 8,244 Debt-to-capitalization ratio 20 % 23 % Adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio (including capitalized operating lease obligations) 57 % 67 % (1) Fiscal 2003 includes $5million of Musicland debt.
(2) Fiscal 2003 includes $1.2billion of Musicland capitalized operating lease obligations.
The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to our adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by eight), is our debt-to-capitalization ratio. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio excludes capitalized operating lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by eight) in both the numerator and denominator of the above calculation.
38 Contractual Obligations The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations by fiscal year ($ in millions): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt obligations $ 776 $ 355 $ 406 $ 2 $ 13 Capital lease obligations 16 13 3   Master lease obligation 58  58   Operating lease obligations 4,654 454 815 764 2,621 Purchase obligations (1) 636 456 174 6  Deferred compensation (2)      Total $ 6,140 $ 1,278 $ 1,456 $ 772 $ 2,634 Note:For more information regarding long-term debt, operating leases and purchase obligations, refer to Notes 4, 7 and 11, respectively, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
(1) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, we included open purchase orders in the table above which are not legally binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and substantially all orders are fulfilled within 30days.
(2) Included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at February28, 2004, is a $58million obligation for deferred compensation. As the specific payment dates for the deferred compensation is unknown, related balances have not been reflected in the above table.
Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of the financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K. Management believes that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our independent auditorand the Audit Committee of our BoardofDirectors.
39 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Inventory Reserves We value our inventory at the lower of the cost of the inventory or fair market value through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss reserves.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our markdown or inventory lossreserves during the past three fiscalyears.
Our markdown reserve represents the excess of the carrying value, typically cost, over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory based upon our assumptions regarding forecasted consumer demand, the promotional environment, inventory aging and technological obsolescence.
Our inventory loss reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) that occurred since the last physical inventory date. Independent physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure that the merchandise inventory reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated. During the interim period between physical inventory counts, we accrue for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location-by-location basis, based on a number of factors, including historical results and current inventory loss trends.
If our estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to losses or gains in excess of our established markdown reserve that could be material. A 10% difference in our actual markdown reserve at February28,2004, would have affected net earnings by approximately $3millionfor the fiscal year ended February28,2004.
If our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in actual physical inventory losses reserved for at February 28, 2004, would have affected net earnings by approximately $3millionfor the fiscal year ended February28,2004.
Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets such as property and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets contained in our financial statements may not be recoverable.
When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited.
Our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
Using the impairment review methodology described herein, we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $22 million during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2004.
If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.
40 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. The only identifiable intangible asset, other than goodwill, included in our balance sheet is an indefinite-lived tradename related to our Future Shop stores.
We review goodwill and the Future Shop tradename for potential impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or the Future Shop tradename might exceed their current fair value. To assist in the process of reviewing goodwill and the Future Shop tradename for impairment, we obtain appraisals from an independent valuation firm. In addition to the use of an independent valuation firm, we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other publicly available market information.
We determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and the Future Shop tradename using the methodology described herein, and determined there was no impairment.
If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to a goodwill impairment charge. The carrying value of goodwill as of February 28, 2004, was $477 million.
If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or if we ever were to discontinue the use of the Future Shop tradename as a result of abandoning our dual-branding strategy in Canada or otherwise, we may be exposed to an impairment charge. The carrying value of the Future Shop tradename as of February28, 2004, was$37million.
Extended Service Contract Liability We assumed a liability for certain self-insured extended service contracts when we acquired Future Shop. The terms of these extended service contracts vary by product and extend through fiscal 2007.
The liability for the self-insured extended service contracts is based on a number of factors, including historical trends in product failure rates and the expected material and labor costs necessary to provide the services. We use independent actuaries to assist us in establishing our extended service contract liability. The frequency and severity of repair costs are the two primary factors affecting our extended service contract liability.
See Notes 1 and 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form10-K, for further discussion regarding our accounting for extended service contracts.
The accounting for self-insured extended service contracts requires us to make assumptions and apply judgment when estimating product failure rates and expected material and labor costs necessary to provide the services. Periodically, management reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of our extended service contract liability and adjusts the amount as necessary.
If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our extended service contract liability, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.
A 10% change in the extended service contract liability at February 28, 2004, would have affected net earnings by approximately $1 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2004.
41 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Costs Associated with Exit Activities We occasionally vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease. For vacated locations that are under long-term leases, we record an expense for the difference between our future lease payments and related costs (e.g., real estate taxes and common area maintenance) from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term, net of expected future sublease rental income.
The net cash flows are discounted using a risk-free interest rate that coincides with the remaining lease term. Our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience; our analysis of the specific real estate market, including input from independent real estate firms; and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict.
The calculation of our location closing liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the timing and duration of future vacancy periods, the amount and timing of future settlement payments, and the amount and timing of potential future sublease income. When making these assumptions, we consider a number of factors, including historical settlement experience, the owner of the property, the location and condition of the property, the terms of the underlying lease, the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions.
If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.
A 10% change in our location closing liability at February 28, 2004, would have resulted in an approximately $2 million change in net earnings for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2004.
Self-Insured Liabilities We are self-insured for certain losses related to health, workers' compensation and general liability insurance, although we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims.
When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries.
Periodically, management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self-insured liabilities.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insured liabilities during the past three years.
Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheetdate.
If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.
A 10% change in our self-insurance liabilities at February 28, 2004, would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2004.
42 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Tax Contingencies Like most companies, domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, we record reserves for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved. As of the end of fiscal 2004, four open tax years were undergoing examination by the United States Internal Revenue Service, and three open years with Revenue Canada.
The estimate of our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions.
Although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.
To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
Revenue Recognition See Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K, for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies.
During fiscal 2004, we launched Reward Zone, our customer loyalty program, which allows members to earn points for each purchase completed at U.S. Best Buy stores. After earning the required point total, members are awarded a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases. The value of points earned by members are recorded as a liability and a reduction of revenue based on the percentage of points that are projected to be redeemed.
From time to time, we offer customers mail-in rebates valid for a refund of a portion of the price paid for merchandise or services. Rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on the percentage of rebates that are projected to be redeemed.
We apply judgment in estimating the number of certificates expected to be redeemed by members of our customer loyalty program and rebate offers that will be redeemed by customers. Our estimate of the number of certificates and rebates that will be redeemed is primarily based on historical transactionexperience.
If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.
A 10% change in the Reward Zone and rebate liabilities at February 28, 2004, would have affected net earnings by approximately $2 million and $8 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2004.
43 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Long-Term Incentive Program In fiscal 2004, we launched a new long-term incentive program for certain U.S. employees designed to help us attract and retain the best employees and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders. Under the terms of the new program, which began in November 2003, eligible employees may receive a mix of restricted stock and stock options issued pursuant to existing shareholder-approved plans. Shares of restricted stock vest at the end of a three-year incentive period based on our total return to shareholders compared with the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500.
At the end of each fiscal quarter, we are required to estimate the percentage of restricted stock that will vest at the end of the three-year incentive period in order to determine the amount of compensation expense to be recognized for the program.
Our estimate for the percentage of restricted stock that will vest is based on the projected performance of our stock compared with the S&P 500 during the three-year incentive period.
If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments, we may be exposed to changes in compensation expense that could be material.
A 10% difference in the percentage of restricted stock that is projected to vest at the end of the three-year incentive period would have changed the liability recorded at February 28, 2004, and net earnings for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2004, by less than a milliondollars.
New Accounting Standards In January2003, the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No.46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities , which requires the consolidation of, and disclosures about, variable interest entities (VIEs). VIEs are entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. In December2003, the FASB revised FIN No.46 to incorporate all decisions, including those in previously issued FASB Staff Positions, into one Interpretation. The revised Interpretation supersedes the original Interpretation. In most circumstances, the requirements were effective immediately for all VIEs in which an interest was acquired after January31, 2003. For variable interests in special purpose entities in which an interest was acquired before February1, 2003, the requirements were effective for us at the end of fiscal 2004. Requirements for non-special purpose entities acquired before February1, 2003, are effective for us at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2005. FIN No.46 has not had, and is not expected to have, a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
During fiscal year 2004, we adopted EITF Issue No.03-10, Application of Issue 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers , which amends EITF No.02-16. According to the amended guidance, if certain criteria are met, consideration received by a reseller in the form of reimbursement from a vendor for honoring the vendor's sales incentives offered directly to consumers (e.g., manufacturers' coupons) should not be recorded as a reduction of the cost of the reseller's purchases from the vendor. The adoption of EITF No.03-10 did not impact reported net earnings, financial position or cash flows.
Quarterly Results and Seasonality Similar to many retailers, our business is seasonal. Historically, we have realized more of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday selling season, than in any other fiscal quarter. The timing of new store openings, costs associated with acquisitions and development of new businesses, and general economic conditions also may affect our future quarterly results.
Selected quarterly financial data is included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
44 Fourth-Quarter Summary  Earnings from continuing operations increased 24% to $469million, or $1.42 per diluted share, compared with $378million, or $1.16 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The increase in earnings from continuing operations was driven by revenue gains, including a comparable store sales increase of 9.7%, and an improved gross profit rate, and was partially offset by a modest increase in our SG&A rate.
Revenue increased 21% to $8.4billion, compared with $7.0billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, driven by a comparable store sales gain of 9.7%, the addition of 78 stores in the past 12months and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Our gross profit rate increased 0.3% of revenue to 25.4% of revenue, up from 25.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The increase in the gross profit rate was primarily due to gross profit rate improvements within our product categories and a more effective use of promotions in the Domestic segment compared with the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. These improvements were partially offset by costs associated with Reward Zone; the increase of the home office category in the revenue mix, as that product category carries a lower gross profit rate; and a more promotional environment in the International segment compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
Our SG&A rate increased 0.1% of revenue to 16.4% of revenue, up from 16.3% of revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The modest SG&A rate increase was primarily due to increased performance-based incentive compensation, expenses associated with our customer centricity initiative and reduced funding from vendor alliance programs. These factors were partially offset by expense leverage from a 21% increase in revenue and the realization of cost savings from our efficient enterprise initiative.
Consolidated The following table presents unaudited selected consolidated financial data ($ in millions, except per share amounts): Three Months Ended February 28, 2004 March 1, 2003 Revenue $ 8,449 $ 6,989 Comparable store sales % change (1) 9.7 % 1.2 % Gross profit as a % of revenue 25.4 % 25.1 % SG&A as a % of revenue 16.4 % 16.3 % Operating income $ 759 $ 612 Operating income as a % of revenue 9.0 % 8.7 % Earnings from continuing operations $ 469 $ 378 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax  (67 ) Net earnings $ 469 $ 311 Diluted earnings per share  continuing operations $ 1.42 $ 1.16 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.42 $ 0.96 Note: All periods presented reflect the classification of Musicland's financial results as discontinued operations.
(1) Comprised of revenue at stores and Internet sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of acquisition. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage change excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we refined our methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage change. It now reflects the impact of non-point-of-sale (non-POS) revenue transactions. We refined our comparable store sales calculation methodology in light of changes in our business. Previously, our comparable store sales calculation was based on store POS revenue. The comparable store sales change for fiscal 2004 has been computed based on the refined methodology. The comparable store sales change for the prior fiscal year has not been computed using the refined methodology. Refining the methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage change did not impact previously reported revenue, earnings or cash flows.
Earnings from continuing operations were $469million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, 45 or $1.42 per diluted share, a 24% increase from $378million, or $1.16 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The increase in earnings from continuing operations was driven by a 21% increase in revenue, including a comparable store sales gain of 9.7%, and an improved gross profit rate, and was partially offset by a modest increase in our SG&A rate.
Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 21% to $8.4billion, compared with $7.0billion for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Revenue from our Domestic and International segments increased 19% and 46%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared with the same period of the prior year. Approximately two-fifths of the increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was due to the 9.7% comparable store sales gain. The addition of 78 stores in the past 12months also accounted for approximately two-fifths of the revenue increase for the quarter. The remainder of the revenue increase for the fiscal fourth quarter was due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue and comparable store sales for the fiscal fourth quarter also benefited from revenue gains at our Web sites.
The fiscal fourth-quarter comparable store sales gain was driven by an improved economic environment, including an increase in consumer confidence which resulted in higher customer traffic in our stores. Also contributing to the comparable store sales gain were effective advertising and promotional campaigns, as well as the redemption of gift cards and Reward Zone certificates following the holiday selling season. Customer traffic accelerated in the second half of December and sustained that pace through the end of the quarter. Products having the largest impact on our fiscal fourth-quarter comparable store sales gain included notebook and desktop computers, digital televisions, digital cameras and accessories, DVD movies, CDs, MP3 players and digital camcorders.
Our gross profit rate improved to 25.4% of revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared with 25.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. The increase in the gross profit rate for the fiscal fourth quarter was primarily due to gross profit rate improvements within our product categories and a more effective use of promotions in the Domestic segment compared with the prior fiscal year. The improvements in the gross profit rates within our product categories resulted from specific initiatives, including reducing markdowns, improving product assortments and developing more effective promotions. These factors were partially offset by costs associated with Reward Zone; the increase of home office products in the revenue mix, as that product category carries a lower gross profit rate; and a more promotional environment in the International segment compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
The SG&A rate increased to 16.4% of revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared with 16.3% of revenue for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. The modest SG&A rate increase was primarily due to increased performance-based incentive compensation as a result of improved year-over-year financial performance, expenses associated with our customer centricity initiative and reduced funding from vendor alliance programs. These factors were partially offset by expense leverage from the 21% increase in revenue and the realization of cost savings from our efficient enterprise initiative.
46 Segment Performance Domestic The following table presents unaudited selected financial data for the Domestic segment ($ in millions): Three Months Ended February 28, 2004 March 1, 2003 Revenue $ 7,605 $ 6,411 Comparable stores sales % change (1) 9.9 % 1.2 % Gross profit as a % of revenue 25.5 % 25.1 % SG&A as a % of revenue 16.1 % 15.9 % Operating income $ 712 $ 591 Operating income as a % of revenue 9.4 % 9.2 % Note: All periods presented reflect the classification of Musicland's financial results as discontinued operations.

It now reflects the impact of non-point-of-sale (non-POS) revenue transactions. We refined our comparable store sales calculation methodology in light of changes in our business. Previously, our comparable store sales calculation was based on store POS revenue. The comparable store sales change for fiscal 2004 has been computed based on the refined methodology. The comparable store sales change for the prior fiscal year has not been computed using the refined methodology. Refining the methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage change did not impact previously reported revenue, earnings or cash flows.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Domestic operating income increased to $712million, or 9.4% of revenue, compared with $591million, or 9.2% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. The improvement in our Domestic segment's operating income for the fiscal fourth quarter was driven by revenue gains, including a 9.9% comparable store sales increase, and a 0.4% of revenue improvement in the gross profit rate, and was partially offset by an increase in the SG&A rate.
Domestic revenue was $7.6billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, a 19% increase compared with fiscal 2003 fourth-quarter revenue of $6.4billion. Slightly more than half of the revenue increase was due to the 9.9% comparable store sales gain. The remainder of the revenue increase resulted from the addition of 60 U.S. Best Buy stores and three Magnolia Audio Video stores in the past 12months. Revenue and comparable store sales for the fiscal fourth quarter also benefited from revenue gains at our Domestic Web sites.
All four product categories posted comparable store sales gains for the fiscal fourth quarter. The mid-teens comparable store sales gain in the home office category was primarily driven by sales of personal computers, MP3 players and computer networking products, partially offset by softer sales of PDAs. The high-single-digit comparable store sales gain in consumer electronics was primarily driven by sales of digital televisions, digital cameras and accessories, and digital camcorders, and was partially offset by declines in sales of analog televisions. For the fiscal fourth quarter, the entertainment software category had a high-single-digit comparable store sales gain, fueled by new releases and our improved assortments in both DVD movies and CDs, partially offset by a comparable store sales decline in video game hardware. The appliances category posted a comparable store sales gain in the high-single digits for the fiscal fourth quarter, primarily benefiting from an expanded assortment and strong new products in higher-end laundry products, refrigerators and dishwashers, as well as effective promotions.
The Domestic gross profit rate increased to 25.5% of revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an improvement of 0.4% of revenue compared with 25.1% of revenue for the same period of fiscal 2003. The increase in the gross profit rate for the fiscal fourth quarter was primarily due to gross profit rate improvements within our product categories and a more effective use of promotions compared with the prior fiscal year. The improvements in the gross profit rates within 47 our product categories resulted from specific initiatives, including reducing markdowns, improving product assortments and developing more effective promotions. These factors were partially offset by costs associated with Reward Zone and the increase of the home office category in the revenue mix, as that product category carries a lower gross profit rate.
The Domestic SG&A rate increased 0.2% of revenue to 16.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, up from 15.9% of revenue for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. The modest SG&A rate increase was primarily due to increased performance-based incentive compensation as a result of improved year-over-year financial performance, expenses associated with our customer centricity initiative and reduced funding from vendor alliance programs. These factors were partially offset by expense leverage from the 9.9% comparable store sales gain, the addition of 60 U.S. Best Buy stores and three Magnolia Audio Video stores in the past 12months, as well as the realization of cost savings from our efficient enterprise initiative.
International The following table presents unaudited selected financial data for the International segment ($ in millions): Three Months Ended February 28, 2004 March 1, 2003 Revenue $ 844 $ 578 Comparable stores sales % change (1) 7.9 % 0.6 % Gross profit as a % of revenue 24.2 % 24.9 % SG&A as a % of revenue 18.7 % 21.3 % Operating income $ 47 $ 21 Operating income as a % of revenue 5.5 % 3.6 % (1) Comprised of revenue at stores and Internet sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of acquisition. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage change excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we refined our methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage change. It now reflects the impact of non-point-of-sale (non-POS) revenue transactions. We refined our comparable store sales calculation methodology in light of changes in our business. Previously, our comparable store sales calculation was based on store POS revenue. The comparable store sales change for fiscal 2004 has been computed based on the refined methodology. The comparable store sales change for the prior fiscal year has not been computed using the refined methodology. Refining the methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage change did not impact previously reported revenue, earnings or cash flows.
The International segment's operating income increased to $47million, or 5.5% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared with fourth-quarter operating income of $21million, or 3.6% of revenue, for fiscal 2003. Approximately three-tenths of the increase in operating income for the fiscal fourth quarter was due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The remainder of the improvement in operating income for the fiscal fourth quarter resulted from revenue gains, including a 7.9% comparable store sales increase, and a reduction in the SG&A rate, and was partially offset by a lower gross profitrate.
International revenue increased 46% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to $844million, compared with $578million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, International revenue would have increased 24% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared with the same period of the prior fiscal year. The addition of four Future Shop stores and 11 Canadian Best Buy stores in the past 12months accounted for approximately three-fifths of the revenue increase for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The remainder of the fiscal fourth-quarter revenue increase, excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, was due to the 7.9% comparable store sales gain. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were primarily driven by strength in sales of digital televisions, DVD movies and digital 48 cameras. Revenue and comparable store sales for the fiscal fourth quarter also benefited from revenue gains at our International Web site.
The International gross profit rate was 24.2% of revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, down from 24.9% of revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The decline in the gross profit rate was primarily due to increased promotional activity compared with the same period of the prior fiscal year, including higher customer financing expenses. In response to the opening of Best Buy stores in Canada, our International segment competitors increased their promotional offerings, resulting in additional pressure on our grossprofitrate.
The International SG&A rate declined to 18.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared with 21.3% of revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The SG&A rate decline for the fiscal fourth quarter was primarily driven by expense leverage as a result of the higher revenue base, improved operating efficiencies and reduced use of outside consulting services. Also, the International SG&A rate was positively affected by favorable settlements related to previously established legal and location closing liabilities, which did not have a significant effecton our consolidated fiscal 2004 earnings from continuingoperations.
Discontinued Operations The following table presents unaudited selected financial data for Discontinued Operations ($inmillions): Three Months Ended February 28, 2004 March 1, 2003 Revenue $  $ 585 Operating loss  (147 ) Interest expense  (3 ) Loss before income tax benefit  (150 ) Income tax benefit (1)  83 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $  $ (67 ) (1) The fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 included a $25million tax benefit resulting from the differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes at acquisition, which were expected to be realized upon the disposition of Musicland.
See the "Overview" section of this MD&A for additional information regarding the sale of our interest in Musicland.
Outlook for Fiscal 2005 Our outlook for fiscal 2005 is based on information presently available and contains certain assumptions regarding future economic conditions. Differences in actual economic conditions compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our fiscal 2005 results.
Looking forward to fiscal 2005, we are projecting earnings from continuing operations in a range of $2.80 to $2.93 per diluted share, an increase of 15% to 20% compared with earnings from continuing operations of $2.44 per diluted share for fiscal 2004. We expect the earnings growth to be driven by an increase in revenue of 11% to 13% and an increase in our operating income rate to approximately 5.6% of revenue for fiscal 2005, compared with 5.3% of revenue for fiscal 2004.
We are projecting revenue of approximately $27.5billion for fiscal 2005, compared with revenue of $24.5billion for fiscal 2004. We expect strong comparable store sales gains in the first 49 half of fiscal 2005 and the opening of approximately 73 new stores during the fiscal year will drive the revenue growth. We believe that comparable store sales gains in the first half of the fiscal year will benefit from continued consumer demand for digital products, increased brand awareness and customer loyalty, income tax refunds and easier comparisons with the first half of fiscal 2004. We expect comparable store sales gains to moderate somewhat in the second half of fiscal 2005 due to more challenging comparisons to revenue in the second half of fiscal 2004, which benefited from last fall's tax rebates. For the fiscal year, we are projecting an increase of 4% to 6% in comparable store sales.
Our fiscal 2005 outlook assumes an improvement in our operating income rate of approximately 0.3% of revenue, mainly due to a decrease in our SG&A rate. The improvement in our fiscal 2005 SG&A rate is expected to be primarily driven by efficiency initiatives and leverage from the comparable store sales gain and a larger base of stores, offset by additional expenses associated with our customer centricity initiative.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 are expected to be approximately $700million. Of our total anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal 2005, approximately $350million will support our planned new-store openings and various U.S. and Canadian store remodeling projects. Specifically, the capital expenditures are expected to support the opening of approximately 60 new U.S. Best Buy stores, 10 Best Buy stores in Canada and three Future Shop stores. We also expect to convert up to 110 additional existing U.S. Best Buy stores to our customer centricity platform, remodel some of our U.S. Best Buy stores in key strategic markets, and relocate four Future Shop stores. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 also are expected to include approximately $165million in technology investments intended to, among other things, improve our customer service capabilities and to increase operating efficiencies. We anticipate that our technology investments will remain relatively consistent over the next few fiscal years as we begin to leverage recently implemented systems. Finally, during fiscal 2005, we expect to complete the construction of our new Ardmore, Oklahoma, distribution center and the expansion of our Brampton, Ontario, distribution center.
During fiscal 2005, we plan to continue with our quarterly dividend program and, given our strong cash position at the end of fiscal 2004 and our expected cash needs for fiscal 2005, we will consider increasing the size of our quarterly dividend. Our second regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share is payable on May12, 2004, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April21, 2004.
We also expect to continue repurchasing our common stock during fiscal 2005 pursuant to a $400million share repurchase program authorized by the Company's Board of Directors in fiscal 2000. At the end of fiscal 2004, $200million of the $400million originally authorized by the Company's Board of Directors was available for future share repurchases. From the end of fiscal 2004 through April20, 2004, we had repurchased and retired an additional 875,000 shares of our common stock at a cost of $46million. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Our debt is not subject to material interest-rate volatility risk. The rates on a substantial portion of our debt may be reset, but may not be more than one percentage point higher than the current rates. If the rates on the debt were to be reset one percentage point higher, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $8million. We do not currently manage the risk through the use of derivative instruments.
We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our acquisition of Future Shop in Canada in November2001. At this time, we do not manage the risk through the use of derivative instruments. A 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rate would not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financialposition.

55 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements $ in millions, except per share amounts 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Best Buy Co.,Inc. is a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home-office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services with fiscal 2004 revenue from continuing operations of $24.5billion. We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of U.S. Best Buy and Magnolia Audio Video (formerly operating as Magnolia Hi-Fi) operations. U.S. Best Buy stores offer a wide variety of consumer electronics, home-office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services, and operated 608 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia at the end of fiscal 2004. Magnolia Audio Video stores offer high-end audio and video products with 22 stores in Washington, Oregon and California. Magnolia Audio Video was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The International segment is comprised of Future Shop and Best Buy operations in Canada. At the end of fiscal 2004 we operated 108 Future Shop and 19 Canadian Best Buy stores. Future Shop and Canadian Best Buy stores offer products similar to those offered by U.S. Best Buy stores. Future Shop stores operate in all Canadian provinces, while the Canadian Best Buy stores operate in Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba. Future Shop was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2002.
On June16, 2003, we sold our interest in Musicland to an affiliate of Sun Capital PartnersInc. As described in Note2, Discontinued Operations, below, we have classified Musicland's financial results as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior to fiscal 2003, the Musicland business was included in our Domestic segment. These Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, except where otherwise indicated, relate to continuing operations only.
Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Best Buy Co.,Inc. and its subsidiaries. We have eliminated significant intercompany accounts and transactions. All subsidiaries are wholly owned.
Reclassifications Certain previous-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on net earnings, financial position or cash flows.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.
Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of February. Fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 each included 52 weeks.
Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. We carry these investments at cost, which approximates marketvalue.
Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of average cost or market.
56 $ in millions, except per share amounts Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Property under master and capital lease is comprised of retail locations under our master lease program and point-of-sale equipment used in our retail stores. The related depreciation for master and capital lease assets is included in depreciation expense. Accumulated depreciation for property under master and capital lease was $12 and $3 as of February28, 2004, and March1, 2003, respectively. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the case of leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or lease terms. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extendthe useful life of an asset are capitalized anddepreciated.
Estimated useful lives by major asset category are as follows: Asset Life (inyears) Buildings 30-40 Leasehold improvements 10-25 Fixtures and equipment 3-15 Property under master and capital lease 3-35 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Costs Associated with Exit Activities We account for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which requires long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, to be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset (if any) are less than the carrying value of the asset. When an impairment loss is recognized, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value.
We recorded pre-tax asset impairment charges of $22, $11 and $20, in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The impairment charges in fiscal 2004 related to corporate technology assets that were taken out of service based on changes in our business. The asset impairment charges in fiscal 2003 related to charges associated with vacating existing corporate facilities in connection with the relocation to our new corporate campus in fiscal 2004. The impairment charges in fiscal 2002 related to corporate technology assets, certain fixed assets and an e-commerce investment. Asset impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A).
We adopted SFAS No.146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, on January1, 2003. Since adoption, the present value of costs associated with location closings, primarily future lease costs, are charged to earnings when a location is vacated. Prior to adoption of SFAS No.146, we recognized a liability when we made the decision to relocate or close the location.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method. Effective March3, 2002, we adopted SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminated the systematic amortization of goodwill. The Statement also requires that we review goodwill for impairment at adoption and at least annually thereafter.
57 $ in millions, except per share amounts A reconciliation of reported earnings adjusted to reflect the adoption of SFAS No.142, as if it were effective for all fiscal years presented, is provided below.
2004 2003 2002 Reported earnings from continuing operations $ 800 $ 622 $ 570 Add back goodwill amortization, net of tax   2 Adjusted earnings from continuing operations 800 622 572 Reported loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (29 ) (441 )  Add back goodwill amortization, net of tax   16 Adjusted (loss) earnings from discontinued operations (29 ) (441 ) 16 Loss on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax (66 )   Cumulative effect of change in accounting principles, net of tax  (82 )  Adjusted net earnings $ 705 $ 99 $ 588 Reported basic earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.47 $ 1.93 $ 1.80 Add back goodwill amortization   0.01 Adjusted basic earnings per share from continuing operations 2.47 1.93 1.81 Reported basic loss per share from discontinued operations (0.09 ) (1.37 )  Add back goodwill amortization   0.05 Adjusted basic (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations (0.09 ) (1.37 ) 0.05 Loss on disposal of discontinued operations (0.20 )   Cumulative effect of change in accounting principles  (0.25 )  Adjusted basic earnings per share $ 2.18 $ 0.31 $ 1.86 Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.44 $ 1.91 $ 1.77 Add back goodwill amortization   0.01 Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 2.44 1.91 1.78 Reported diluted loss per share from discontinued operations (0.09 ) (1.36 )  Add back goodwill amortization   0.05 Adjusted diluted (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations (0.09 ) (1.36 ) 0.05 Loss on disposal of discontinued operations (0.20 )   Cumulative effect of change in accounting principles  (0.25 )  Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 2.15 $ 0.30 $ 1.83 During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, we completed the transitional requirements for goodwill impairment testing. As a result of the transitional goodwill impairment testing, we determined that the carrying value of the assets of our Musicland and Magnolia Audio Video businesses, which were acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, exceeded their current fair values. We determine fair values utilizing widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. We based Musicland's fair value on the then-current expectations for the business in light of the then-existing retail environment and the uncertainty associated with future trends in prerecorded music products. We based Magnolia Audio Video's fair value on the then-current expectations for the business in light of recent sales trends and the then-existing business environment, including an economic slowdown in 58 $ in millions, except per share amounts the Pacific Northwest. The resulting after-tax, non-cash impairment charge was $348, of which $308 was associated with Musicland and $40 was associated with Magnolia Audio Video. The charge represented a complete write-off of the goodwill associated with these businesses. As described in Note2, Discontinued Operations, below, we have classified Musicland's financial results as discontinued operations, including the related goodwill impairment charge.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and tradename recorded in our International segment, using the same techniques as described above, and determined there was no impairment.
Goodwill totaled $477 and $429 at February28, 2004, and March1, 2003, respectively. The change in the International segment's goodwill balance from March1, 2003, was the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Intangible assets totaled $37 and $33 at February28, 2004, and March1, 2003, respectively. The only identifiable intangible asset included in our balance sheet is an indefinite-lived intangible tradename related to Future Shop, which is included in the International segment. The change in the intangible asset balance from March1, 2003, was the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for continuing operations were asfollows: Domestic International Total Balances at March 3, 2001 $ 67 $  $ 67 Goodwill resulting from acquisition  406 406 Systematic amortization of goodwill (3 )  (3 ) Changes in foreign currency exchange rates  (5 ) (5 ) Balances at March 2, 2002 64 401 465 Goodwill resulting from acquisition 3  3 Final purchase price allocation adjustment  (5 ) (5 ) Impairment charge (64 )  (64 ) Changes in foreign currency exchange rates  30 30 Balances at March 1, 2003 3 426 429 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates  48 48 Balances at February 28, 2004 $ 3 $ 474 $ 477 Insurance We are self-insured for certain costs related to health, workers' compensation and general liability insurance, although we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims. We estimate our self-insured liabilities using historical experience and valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries.
Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in our statement of earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying 59 $ in millions, except per share amounts amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
Long-Term Liabilities The major components of long-term liabilities at February28, 2004, and March1, 2003, included deferred compensation plan liabilities, long-term rent-related liabilities, deferred income taxes andadvances received under vendor allianceprograms.
Foreign Currency Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions have not beensignificant.
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from the sale of merchandise at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. We recognize service revenue at the time the service is provided, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Proceeds from the sales of gift cards are deferred until redeemed by the customer. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue.
We sell extended service contracts on behalf of an unrelated third party. In jurisdictions where we are not deemed to be the obligor on the contract, commissions are recognized in revenue at the time of sale. In jurisdictions where we are deemed to be the obligor on the contract, commissions are recognized in revenue ratably over the term of the service contract.
Sales Incentives We frequently offer sales incentives that entitle our customers to receive a reduction in the price of a product or service. Sales incentives include discounts, coupons and any other offers that entitle a customer to receive a reduction in the price of a product or service by submitting a claim for a refund or rebate. For sales incentives in which we are the obligor, the reduction in revenue is recognized at the time the product is sold.
During fiscal 2004, we initiated a customer loyalty program which allows members to earn points for each purchase completed at U.S. Best Buy stores. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases at U.S. Best Buy stores. We account for our customer loyalty program in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.00-22, Accounting for "Points" and Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based Sales Incentive Offers, and Offers for Free Products or Services to Be Delivered in the Future.
The value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included as a liability and a reduction of revenue at the time the points are earned based on the percentage of points that are projected to beredeemed.
Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold includes the total cost of products sold, costs of services provided, certain vendor allowances, customer shipping and handling charges, in-bound freight expenses, physical inventory losses, and handling and delivery costs associated with our online and direct-to-consumer businesses.
Vendor Allowances We receive allowances from vendors as a result of purchasing and promoting their products. Vendor allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor's products are included as an expense reduction when the cost is incurred. Subsequent to fiscal 2002, all other 60 $ in millions, except per share amounts vendor allowances, including vendor allowances received in excess of our cost to promote a vendor's product, are initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventories. The deferred amounts are then included as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related product is sold. Vendor allowances included in SG&A were approximately $92 and $118, in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Prior to fiscal 2003, the majority of vendor allowances were included as a reduction of advertising expenses in SG&A (see Change in Accounting Principles  Goodwill and Vendor Allowances, below).
Selling, General& Administrative Expenses SG&A includes payroll and benefit costs; occupancy costs; depreciation; advertising; vendor allowances that are a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs to promote a vendor's products; outside service fees; costs associated with operating our distribution network that primarily relate to moving merchandise from distribution centers to stores; and long-lived asset impairment charges.
Advertising Costs Advertising costs, which are included in SG&A, are expensed the first time the advertisement runs. Gross advertising expenses, before expense reimbursement from vendor allowances, for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $675, $567 and $493,respectively.
Pre-Opening Costs Non-capital expenditures associated with opening new stores are expensed as incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation In December2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No.148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure . SFAS No.148 amends SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No.148 requires expanded and more prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results.
We have stock-based compensation plans including fixed stock option plans, restricted stock and an employee stock purchase plan. We have not adopted a method under SFAS No.148 to expense stock options, but continue to apply Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations in accounting for these plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for stock option grants, as the exercise price equals the stock price on the date of grant. In addition, compensation expense has not been recognized for our employee stock purchase plan as it is intended to be a plan that qualifies under Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Restricted stock awards result in compensation expense as discussed in Note5, Shareholders' Equity, below.
The table below illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123 to stock-based compensation for each of the last three fiscalyears.
61 $ in millions, except per share amounts 2004 2003 2002 Net earnings, as reported $ 705 $ 99 $ 570 Add: Stock-based compensation expense included in reported net earnings, net of tax (1) 5 1 1 Deduct: Stock-based compensation expense determined under fair value method for all awards, net of tax (101 ) (85 ) (59 ) Net earnings, pro forma $ 609 $ 15 $ 512 Earnings per share: Basic  as reported $ 2.18 $ 0.31 $ 1.80 Basic  pro forma $ 1.88 $ 0.05 $ 1.62 Diluted  as reported $ 2.15 $ 0.30 $ 1.77 Diluted  pro forma $ 1.88 $ 0.05 $ 1.61 (1) Amounts represent the after-tax compensation costs for restricted stock awards.
The fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: 2004 2003 2002 Risk-free interest rate 3.3 % 4.2 % 4.9 % Expected dividend yield 0.8 %   Expected stock price volatility 60 % 60 % 55 % Expected life of stock options 5.5 years 5.0 years 4.5 years The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 used in computing pro forma compensation expense was $30.93, $23.91 and $18.60 per share, respectively.
Derivative Financial Instruments SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, requires that all derivatives be included on the balance sheet at fair value. Our only derivative financial instrument was an interest rate swap with a fair value of $4 and $5 as of February28, 2004, and March1, 2003, respectively. Our interest rate swap is included in long-term debt.
Change in Accounting Principles  Goodwill and Vendor Allowances The adoption of SFAS No.142 related to goodwill described above has been accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and applied cumulatively as if the change had occurred at March3, 2002, the beginning of fiscal 2003.
In September2002, the EITF released Issue No.02-16, Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor, with final consensus reached in March2003. EITF No.02-16 establishes the accounting standards for recording vendor allowances in a retailer's income statement.
During fiscal 2003, we changed our method of accounting for vendor allowances in accordance with EITF No.02-16. Based on the new standard, vendor allowances are considered a reduction in the price of a vendor's products or services and included as a component of cost of goods sold when the related product or service is sold, unless the allowance represents a reimbursement of a specific, incremental and identifiable cost incurred to sell a vendor's products or services. We continue to record vendor allowances that represent a reimbursement of a specific, incremental and identifiable cost incurred to sell a 62 $ in millions, except per share amounts vendor's products or services as a reduction of the related cost in SG&A. Previously, and in accordance with GAAP, we had recognized and classified a majority of vendor allowances as a reduction of advertising costs in SG&A. The cumulative effect of the change in our method of accounting for vendor allowances resulted in an after-tax, non-cash charge to net earnings of $50, of which $8 was associated with Musicland. The effect of the change on the fiscal year ended March1, 2003, was a decrease in net earnings from continuing operations of $1. As described in Note2, Discontinued Operations, below, we have classified Musicland's financial results as discontinued operations, including the relatedcumulative effect of the change in accountingprinciple.
New Accounting Standards In January2003, the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No.46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities , which requires the consolidation of, and disclosures about, variable interest entities (VIEs). VIEs are entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. In December2003, the FASB revised FIN No.46 to incorporate all decisions, including those in previously issued FASB Staff Positions, into one Interpretation. The revised Interpretation supersedes the original Interpretation. In most circumstances, the requirements were effective immediately for all VIEs in which an interest was acquired after January31, 2003. For variable interests in special purpose entities in which an interest was acquired before February1, 2003, the requirements were effective for us at the end of fiscal 2004. Requirements for non-special purpose entities acquired before February1, 2003, are effective for us at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2005. FIN No.46 has not had, and is not expected to have, a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
During fiscal year 2004, we adopted EITF Issue No.03-10, Application of Issue No.02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers , which amends EITF No.02-16. According to the amended guidance, if certain criteria are met, consideration received by a reseller in the form of reimbursement from a vendor for honoring the vendor's sales incentives offered directly to consumers (e.g., manufacturers' coupons) should not be recorded as a reduction of the cost of the reseller's purchases from the vendor. The adoption of EITF No.03-10 did not impact reported net earnings, financial position or cash flows.
2. Discontinued Operations During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we committed to a plan to sell our interest in Musicland. On June16, 2003, we sold our interest in Musicland to an affiliate of Sun Capital PartnersInc. The affiliate of Sun Capital PartnersInc. assumed all of Musicland's liabilities, including approximately $500 in lease obligations, in exchange for all of the capital stock of Musicland and paid no cash consideration. The transaction also resulted in the transfer of all of Musicland's assets, other than a distribution center in Franklin, Indiana, and selected nonoperating assets. The loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2004 includes a loss on the disposal of discontinued operations (which was primarily non-cash) of $66, net of tax, related to the sale of Musicland. In connection with the sale, Musicland is purchasing transition support services from us for up to one year from the date of the sale, until Musicland is able to develop long-term service providers for these services. In accordance with SFAS No.144, Musicland's financial results are reported separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
During fiscal 2003, we recorded an after-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $308 for the full write-off of goodwill related to our acquisition of Musicland. In addition, we recorded an after-tax, non-cash charge of $8 for the change in our method of accounting for Musicland vendor allowances. The charges are classified as cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles in discontinued operations (see Note1,Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,above).
63 $ in millions, except per share amounts Also during fiscal 2003, in accordance with SFAS No.144, we recorded an impairment charge of $166 before tax in "(Loss) earnings before income taxes" related to a reassessment of the carrying value of Musicland's long-lived assets. We determined fair values utilizing widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. We based fair values on the then-current expectations for the business in light of the then-existing retail environment and the uncertainty associated with future trends in prerecorded music products.
The financial results of Musicland, included in discontinued operations, were as follows: For the Fiscal Years Ended Feb. 28, 2004 (1) March 1, 2003 March 2, 2002 Revenue $ 354 $ 1,727 $ 1,886 (Loss) earnings before income taxes (46 ) (244 ) 10 Loss before the disposal and the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of $17, $119 and $10 tax, respectively (29 ) (125 )  Loss on disposal of discontinued operations, net of $0 tax (66 )   Cumulative effect of change in accounting principles, net of $5 tax  (316 )  Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (95 ) (441 )  (1) Fiscal 2004 includes operating results from March2, 2003, through June16, 2003, the date we sold our interest in Musicland.
In fiscal 2003, we recorded a deferred tax asset of $25 in conjunction with the classification of Musicland as discontinued operations. This tax benefit resulted from differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes at acquisition, which were expected to be realized upon the disposition of Musicland.
In fiscal 2004, based on the terms of the sale of our interest in Musicland, we determined that the nature of our future taxable income may not allow us to realize the tax benefits of the deferred tax assets associated with our discontinued operations and provided a full valuation allowance against the $25 deferred tax asset referred to above which is included in the loss on disposal of discontinued operations.
There were no assets or liabilities of Musicland included in our balance sheet at February28, 2004. The current and noncurrent assets and liabilities of Musicland as of March1, 2003, were as follows: March 1, 2003 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2 Receivables 3 Merchandise inventories 316 Other current assets 76 Current assets of discontinued operations $ 397 Net property and equipment $ 69 Other assets 88 Noncurrent assets of discontinued operations $ 157 Accounts payable $ 208 Accrued compensation and related expenses 14 Accrued liabilities 98 Current liabilities of discontinued operations $ 320 Long-term liabilities $ 20 Long-term debt 5 Noncurrent liabilities of discontinued operations $ 25 64 $ in millions, except per share amounts 3. Acquisitions In the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we acquired all of the common stock of Future Shop for $377, or $368 net of cash acquired, including transaction costs. We acquired Future Shop to further our expansion plans and to increase shareholder value. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with SFAS No.141, Business Combinations . Accordingly, we recorded the net assets at their estimated fair values, and included operating results in our financial statements from the date of acquisition. We allocated the purchase price on a preliminary basis using information then available. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired was finalized in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. The primary adjustments to the preliminary allocation were to assign value to the Future Shop tradename as a result of our decisions to operate stores in Canada under both the Best Buy and Future Shop tradenames, and to adjust the extended service contract liability assumed as of the date of acquisition based on additional information. The final purchase price allocation is shown below and resulted in a $5 decrease to goodwill from our preliminary allocation. All goodwill is nondeductible for tax purposes. Under SFAS No.142, goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at leastannually.
The final purchase price allocation was as follows: Merchandise inventories $ 169 Property and equipment 103 Goodwill 401 Intangible asset 32 Other assets 43 Current liabilities (341 ) Debt, including current portion (13 ) Other liabilities (26 ) Total $ 368 The following unaudited pro forma data sets forth the consolidated results of continuing operations as though Future Shop had been acquired as of the beginning of fiscal 2002: 2002 Revenue $ 18,506 Net earnings 570 Basic earnings per share 1.80 Diluted earnings per share 1.77 The pro forma results include adjustments, principally the loss of interest income on cash used to finance the acquisition. The pro forma results exclude costs expected to be incurred in connection with the integration of Future Shop's business. The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what actually would have occurred had the acquisition been completed as of the beginning of fiscal 2002, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results.

Convertible Debentures In January2002, we sold convertible subordinated debentures having an aggregate principal amount of $402. The proceeds from the offering, net of $6 in offering expenses, were $396. The debentures mature in 2022 and are callable at our option on or after January15, 2007. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January15, 2007; January15, 2012; and January15, 2017, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. The debentures will be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 14.4927 shares per $0.001 principal amount of debentures, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $69.00 per share, if the closing price of our common stock exceeds a specified price for a specified period of time, if our credit rating falls below specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur. None of the criteria for conversion have been met. The debentures have an initial interest rate of 2.25% per annum. The interest rate may be reset, but not below 2.25% or above 3.25%, on July15, 2006; July15, 2011; and July15, 2016.
In June2001, we sold convertible debentures having an aggregate initial principal amount at maturity of $492. The proceeds from the offering, net of $7 in offering expenses, were $330. The debentures mature in 2021 and are callable at our option on or after June27, 2004. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on June27, 2004; June27, 2009; and June27, 2014, at a purchase price equal to the accreted value of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid cash interest up to but not including the date of purchase. The debentures will be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 11.8071 shares per $0.001 initial principal amount at maturity of the debentures, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $57.91 per share, if the closing price of our common stock exceeds a specified price for a specified period of time, if our credit rating falls below specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur. None of the criteria for conversion have been met. The debentures have an initial yield to maturity of 2.75% per annum, and a portion of the yield to maturity is paid as cash interest at the rate of 1.0% per annum. The 66 $ in millions, except per share amounts yield to maturity may be reset, but not below 2.75% or above 3.75%, on December27, 2008, and December27, 2013.
Certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries have guaranteed the debentures.
Credit Facilities We have a $200 bank revolving credit facility which is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. The facility expires on March21, 2005. Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates specified in the credit agreement for this facility. We also pay certain facility and agent fees. The agreement contains covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth. The agreement also requires that we have no outstanding principal balance for a period not less than 30 consecutive days between December1 of each year and March31 of the following year. As of February28, 2004, and March1, 2003, respectively, $197 and $197 were available under this facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility for any period presented. However, outstanding letters of credit reduce amounts available under this facility.
In March2004, we entered into an agreement for a $19 revolving demand facility related to our International operations, of which $4 is only available on a seasonal basis from August through January of each year. Outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee reduce amounts available under this facility. All borrowings under this facility are made available at the sole discretion of the lender and are payable on demand. Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates specified in the agreement. The agreement for this facility contains certain reporting and operating covenants. This facility replaced a $41 unsecured credit facility, which was canceled on March1, 2004. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at February28, 2004, and March1, 2003. As of March1, 2003, the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under this facility was 4.75% and $15 was available for use.
Inventory Financing We have inventory financing facilities totaling $210 that allow us to extend the due dates of merchandise invoices beyond their normal terms. Borrowings under one of the facilities are collateralized by a security interest in certain merchandise inventories. The amounts extended bear interest at rates ranging from 1.0% below prime rate to 2.0% above prime rate. The prime rate was 4.00% and 4.25% as of February28, 2004, and March1, 2003, respectively. The inventory financing facilities have provisions that entitle the lenders to a portion of the cash discounts provided by the vendors.
As of February28, 2004, and March1, 2003, $140 and $174 was available for use under these inventory financing facilities, respectively.
Other The fair value of long-term debt approximated $902 and $791 as of February28, 2004, and March1, 2003, respectively, based on quotes from external sources, compared with carrying values of $850 and $834, respectively.
We have a master lease program which was used to construct and lease new retail locations. At the end of fiscal 2004, $58 in leases for new stores were outstanding under the master lease program. The master lease program is fully utilized and there will be no further new store development under this program. The program is set to expire on January1, 2006, and is renewable for one year, subject to the lenders' consent.
67 $ in millions, except per share amounts The future maturities of long-term debt, includingmaster and capitalized leases, consist of thefollowing: Fiscal Year 2005 (1) $ 368 2006 62 2007 (1) 405 2008 1 2009 1 Thereafter 13 $ 850 (1) Holders of our debentures due in 2021 and 2022 may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on June27, 2004, and January15, 2007, respectively. The table above assumes that all holders of our debentures exercise their redemption options.
5. Shareholders' Equity Stock Options We sponsor three non-qualified stock option plans for our employees and our Board of Directors. These plans provide for the issuance of up to 73.2million shares of common stock in the aggregate. Options may be granted only to employees or directors at exercise prices not less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. All of the options have a 10-year term. Options issued pursuant to our employee plans vest over a four-year period. Options issued pursuant to our directors' plan vest immediately upon grant. At February28, 2004, a total of 21.3million shares were available for future grants under all plans.
Option activity for the last three fiscal years was asfollows: Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Outstanding on March 3, 2001 26,368,000 $ 22.13 Granted 9,382,000 37.01 Exercised (6,846,000 ) 6.88 Canceled (1,417,000 ) 35.98 Outstanding on March 2, 2002 27,487,000 30.29 Granted 14,253,000 44.06 Exercised (2,850,000 ) 14.01 Canceled (3,336,000 ) 43.65 Outstanding on March 1, 2003 35,554,000 35.89 Granted 3,799,000 58.50 Exercised (4,462,000 ) 25.55 Canceled (3,207,000 ) 41.72 Outstanding on February 28, 2004 31,684,000 $ 39.45 68 $ in millions, except per share amounts Exercisable options at the end of fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 15.4million, 13.4million and 9.9million, respectively. The following table summarizes information concerning options outstanding and exercisable as of February28,2004: Range of Exercise Prices Number Outstanding Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Weighted Average Exercise Price Number Exercisable Weighted Average Exercise Price $0 to $10 1,274,000 3.15 $ 2.24 1,274,000 $ 2.24 $10 to $20 2,975,000 4.20 11.60 2,961,000 11.57 $20 to $30 3,804,000 8.82 28.46 937,000 28.44 $30 to $40 7,436,000 6.57 36.28 4,638,000 35.83 $40 to $50 5,313,000 6.28 46.60 3,796,000 46.63 $50 to $60 10,882,000 8.64 53.94 1,832,000 51.28 $0 to $60 31,684,000 7.14 $ 39.45 15,438,000 $ 32.45 Restricted Stock Plan We adopted a restricted stock award plan in fiscal 2001. The plan authorizes us to issue up to 1.5million shares of our common stock to our eligible employees, consultants and independent contractors, as well as to our Board of Directors, of which 0.2million was available for grant as of February28, 2004. Shares of restricted stock have the same rights as other shares of common stock, except they are not transferable until fully vested. Restricted stock vests based on continued employment with the Company (time-based) or upon achievement of personal or Company performance goals (performance-based). Time-based restricted stock vests over a period of at least three years, during which no more than 25% may vest at the time of award, and no more than 25% may vest on each anniversary date thereafter. Performance-based restricted stock vests at the end of a three-year incentive period based on our total return to shareholders compared with companies that comprise the S&P500 or upon the achievement of company or personal performance goals. Time-based restricted stock compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. Performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is recognized each reporting period based on the number of shares expected to ultimately vest, our stock price and the vesting period. If a plan participant's relationship with us were to be terminated all shares still subject to restrictions are forfeited and returned to the plan. We awarded 1.1million, 0.1million and 0.1million shares of restricted stock in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The weighted average fair value per share for time-based restricted stock awarded in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $57.65, $51.27 and $36.97, respectively. For fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recognized a total of $7.9, $2.4 and $1.6, respectively, on a pre-tax basis, in compensation expense related to the restricted stock issued pursuant to this plan.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan Our shareholders approved the Best Buy Co.,Inc. 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) at our 2003 Regular Meeting of Shareholders. Five million shares have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The ESPP permits employees to purchase shares of our common stock during semi-annual purchase periods beginning on the first Friday of April and October of each year. The shares are purchased at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock, as measured by the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange, at the beginning or at the end of the purchase period. No shares of 69 $ in millions, except per share amounts common stock were issued under the ESPP in fiscal 2004 since the initial purchase period ended on April1, 2004. As of February28, 2004, ESPP participants have accumulated approximately $18 to purchase our common stock.
Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding had the potentially dilutive common shares been issued. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock include stock options, unvested restricted stock awards, shares issuable under our ESPP and convertible debentures assuming certain criteria are met (see Note4, Debt).
The computation of dilutive shares outstanding excluded options to purchase 15.9million, 24.6million and 7.2million shares as of February28, 2004; March1, 2003; and March2, 2002, respectively, because such options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive (i.e., higher earnings per share). Diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended February28, 2004, also did not include 1.4million shares of unvested restricted stock and shares to be issued under our ESPP because they would be antidilutive. Finally, the shares related to the convertible debentures were not included in our diluted earnings per share computation, as the criteria for conversion of the debentures were not met.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 Numerator: Earnings from continuing operations $ 800 $ 622 $ 570 Denominator (in millions): Weighted average common shares outstanding 323.3 321.1 316.0 Effect of dilutive securities: Stock options and other 4.7 3.7 6.5 Weighted average common shares outstanding, assuming dilution 328.0 324.8 322.5 Basic earnings per share  continuing operations $ 2.47 $ 1.93 $ 1.80 Diluted earnings per share continuing operations $ 2.44 $ 1.91 $ 1.77 Repurchase of Common Stock In fiscal 2000, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $400 of our common stock from time to time through open market purchases. This share repurchase program has no stated expiration date. In October2003, we announced our intention to resume buying back shares under this program. In fiscal 2004, 1.8million shares were purchased and retired at a cost of $100. Through February28, 2004, we had purchased and retired 4.6million shares at a cost of $200 since the inception of the program in fiscal 2000.
Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is computed as net earnings plus certain other items that are recorded directly to shareholders' equity. The only significant other item included in comprehensive income is foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive income was $764, $132 and $564 for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
70 $ in millions, except per share amounts 6. Net Interest (Expense) Income Net interest (expense) income for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was comprised of the following: 2004 2003 2002 Interest expense $ (32 ) $ (30 ) $ (21 ) Loss on early retirement of debt   (8 ) Capitalized interest 1 5 1 Interest income 23 23 27 Net interest expense (8 ) (2 ) (1 ) Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations  (6 ) (19 ) Net interest (expense) income from continuing operations $ (8 ) $ 4 $ 18 We allocated interest expense to discontinued operations based upon debt that was attributable to Musicland's operations, including an $8 loss on the early retirement of debt in fiscal 2002.
7. Lease Commitments We lease portions of our corporate facilities and conduct the majority of our retail and distribution operations from leased locations. The leases require payment of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance, in addition to rent. Most of the leases contain renewal options and escalation clauses, and certain store leases require contingent rents based on specified percentages of revenue. Other leases contain covenants related to the maintenance of financial ratios. Transaction costs associated with the sale and lease back of properties and any related gain or loss are recognized over the period of the lease agreements. Proceeds from the sale and lease back of properties are included in other current assets. Also, we lease certain equipment under noncancelable operating and capital leases. Theterms of our lease agreements generally range up to20years.
During fiscal 2004, we entered into a capital lease agreement totaling $26 for point-of-sale equipment used in our retail stores. This lease was a non-cash transaction and has been eliminated from our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
The composition of rental expenses for all operating leases, net of sublease rental income, during the past three fiscal years, including leases of property and equipment, was as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Minimum rentals $ 467 $ 439 $ 366 Contingent rentals 1 1 1 Total rent expense for continuing operations $ 468 $ 440 $ 367 The future minimum lease payments under our capital and operating leases, net of sublease rental income, by fiscal year (not including contingent rentals) as of February28, 2004, are asfollows: Fiscal Year Capital Leases Operating Leases 2005 $ 14 $ 454 2006 3 424 2007  391 2008  385 2009  379 Thereafter  2,621 Subtotal 17 Less: imputed interest (1 ) Present value of capital lease obligations $ 16 8. Benefit Plans We sponsor retirement savings plans for employees meeting certain age and service 71 $ in millions, except per share amounts requirements. The plans provide for company-matching contributions, which are subject to annual approval by our Board of Directors. The total matching contributions were $13, $13 and $10 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
We have a non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for certain management employees and our Board of Directors whose contributions are limited under qualified defined contribution plans. Amounts deferred and contributed under the deferred compensation plan are credited or charged with the performance of investment options offered under the plan and elected by the participants. The liability for compensation deferred under this plan was $58 and $42 at February28, 2004, and March1, 2003, respectively, and is included in long-term liabilities. We manage the risk of changes in the fair value of the liability for deferred compensation by electing to match our liability under the plan with investment vehicles that offset a substantial portion of our exposure. The cash value of the investment vehicles, which includes funding for future deferrals, was $70 and $51 at February28, 2004, and March1, 2003, respectively, and is included in other assets. Both the asset and the liability are carried at fair value.
9. Income Taxes The following is a reconciliation of income tax expense to the federal statutory tax rate for continuing operations for the past three fiscalyears: 2004 2003 2002 Federal income tax at the statutory rate $ 454 $ 355 $ 324 State income taxes, net of federal benefit 27 35 34 Distributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 13   Non-taxable interest income (19 ) (10 ) (3 ) Other 21 12 1 Income tax expense $ 496 $ 392 $ 356 Effective tax rate 38.3 % 38.7 % 38.4 % Income tax expense was comprised of the following for the past three fiscal years: 2004 2003 2002 Current: Federal $ 456 $ 375 $ 301 State 49 51 39 Foreign 5 3 1 510 429 341 Deferred: Federal (9 ) (22 ) 8 State (1 ) (3 ) 1 Foreign (4 ) (12 ) 6 (14 ) (37 ) 15 Income tax expense $ 496 $ 392 $ 356 We have not provided for U.S. income taxes on certain unremitted earnings of international affiliates which we consider to be permanent investments.
Deferred taxes are the result of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes.
72 $ in millions, except per share amounts Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the dates indicated were comprised of the following: February 28, 2004 (1) March 1, 2003 Accrued expenses $ 95 $ 72 Deferred revenue 32 25 Compensation and benefits 45 47 Inventory 31 26 Net operating loss carryforwards 30 21 Goodwill 21 23 Other 31 35 Total deferred tax assets 285 249 Property and equipment (158 ) (154 ) Convertible debt (32 ) (18 ) Other (6 ) (6 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (196 ) (178 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 89 $ 71 (1) Deferred taxes at February28, 2004, include an $85 deferred tax asset associated with the disposition of Musicland. We provided a full valuation reserve against this $85 deferred tax asset because of the uncertainty regarding realization of the benefit.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities were included in our balance sheets as follows: February 28, 2004 March 1, 2003 Other current assets $ 95 $ 127 Long-term liabilities (6 ) (56 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 89 $ 71 Management believes that the realization of the remaining deferred tax assets is more likely than not, based on the expectation that we will generate the necessary taxable income in future periods and, accordingly, no additional valuation reserve has been provided. As of February28, 2004, we had net operating loss carryforwards from our International operations of $81, which expire through 2011. No valuation allowances have been recorded since we expect to utilize the carryforwards fully.
10. Segments We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment includes U.S. Best Buy and Magnolia Audio Video stores. The International segment is comprised of Future Shop and Canadian Best Buy stores. Our segments are evaluated on an operating income basis, and a stand-alone tax provision is not calculated for each segment. The other accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, above.

Commitments and Contingencies We have been served with four purported class action lawsuits on behalf of persons who purchased the securities of Best Buy Co., Inc. between January9, 2002, and August7, 2002. The lawsuits, instituted in U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota on November20, December12, December16 and December23, 2003, name Best Buy Co., Inc., its Chairman and its Chief Executive Officer as defendants. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated Sections10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making material misrepresentations between January9, 2002, and August7, 2002, which resulted in artificially inflated prices of the Company's common stock. The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, costs and expenses. We believe the allegations are without merit and intend to defend these actions vigorously.
We also have been served with a shareholder derivative action venued in Hennepin County, State of Minnesota District Court. This case raises many factual matters similar to those raised in the federal securities law cases, described above. The state court action alleges violations of state law 74 $ in millions, except per share amounts relative to fiduciary responsibilities, control and management of the Company and unjust enrichment. The plaintiffs seek judgment in favor of the Company against certain named officer and director defendants for damages, equitable relief and attorneys' fees, costs and expenses. By agreement between the parties, and with Court approval, this case was put on inactive status. Based on the Company's information and belief, the claims against the named officer and director defendants are without merit and will be vigorously defended.
We are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of conducting business. The resolution of those proceedings is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operation or financial condition.
At the end of fiscal 2004, we had commitments for the purchase and construction of facilities valued at approximately $5.
We adopted FIN No.45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, in fiscal 2003. FIN No.45 provides guidance on the recognition and disclosure of certain types of guarantees, including product warranties. We assumed a liability for certain extended service contracts when we acquired Future Shop in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. We established an accrued liability for the acquired extended service contracts based on historical trends in product failure rates and the expected material and labor costs necessary to provide the services. The remaining terms of these acquired extended service contracts vary by product and extend through fiscal 2007. The estimated remaining liability for acquired extended service contracts at February28, 2004, was $18. Subsequent to the acquisition, all new extended service contracts were sold on behalf of an unrelated third party, without recourse.
The following table reconciles the changes in our liability for our acquired extended service contracts for the years ended February28, 2004, and March1, 2003: Balance at March 2, 2002 $ 17 Final purchase price allocation adjustment 37 Service charges (28 ) Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation 2 Balance at March 1, 2003 28 Service charges (13 ) Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation 3 Balance February 28, 2004 $ 18 75 Report of Best Buy Management To Our Shareholders: Our management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related financial information. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include certain amounts that are based on estimates and informed judgments. Our management also prepared the related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form10-K and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Ernst& Young LLP, independent auditor, who were given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of shareholders, the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors. We believe that all representations made to the independent auditors during its audit were valid and appropriate. The independent auditor's role is to form an opinion as to the fairness with which such financial statements present our financial position and results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The report of Ernst& Young LLP is presented on the following page.
We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurance to management, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors as to the reliability of our financial records and the protection of our shareholders' interests. The system includes a documented organizational structure and division of responsibility; established policies and procedures, including a code of conduct to foster a strong ethical climate, which are communicated throughout Best Buy; and the careful selection, training and development of employees. Internal auditors monitor the operation of the internal control system and report findings and recommendations to management and the Audit Committee, and corrective actions are taken to address control deficiencies and other opportunities for improving the system as they are identified. The Audit Committee, which is comprised completely of independent directors, further augments our system of internal control. The Audit Committee oversees our system of internal control, accounting practices, financial reporting and audits, and assesses whether their quality, integrity and objectivity are sufficient to protect shareholders' investments.
There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of circumvention or overriding of controls. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal control system can change with circumstances. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that the cost of a system of internal control should not exceed the related benefits. We believe our system provides the appropriate balance.
As of February28, 2004, we believe our system of internal control over financial reporting was effective for providing reliable financial statements. We further believe the information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form10-K fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of our Company.
/s/ Bradbury H. Anderson Bradbury H. Anderson Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer /s/ Darren R. Jackson Darren R. Jackson Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer 76 Report of Independent Auditors Shareholders and Board of Directors Best Buy Co.,Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Best Buy Co.,Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of February28, 2004, and March1, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February28, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Best Buy Co.,Inc. and subsidiaries at February28, 2004, and March1, 2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February28, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.142 and its method of accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor to conform to Emerging Issues Task Force No.02-16 effective March3, 2002.

(1) All quarters presented reflect the classification of Musicland's financial results as discontinued operations. Refer to Note2, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K. First-quarter fiscal 2003 results include an after-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $308 for the full write-off of the goodwill related to our acquisition of Musicland. Fourth-quarter fiscal 2003 includes an after-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $102 related to a reassessment of the carrying value of Musicland's long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No.144.
(2) Comprised of revenue at stores and Internet sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening.
78 Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of acquisition. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage change excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we refined our methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage change. It now reflects the impact of non-point-of-sale (non-POS) revenue transactions. We refined our comparable store sales calculation methodology in light of changes in our business. Previously, our comparable store sales calculation was based on store POS revenue. The comparable store sales changes for periods prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2004 have not been computed using the refined methodology. Refining the methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage change did not impact previously reported revenue, earnings or cash flows.
(3) Effective on March3, 2002, we adopted SFAS No.142. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, we completed the required goodwill impairment testing and recognized an after-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $40 that is reflected in our fiscal 2003 first-quarter financial results as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Also effective on March3, 2002, we changed our method of accounting for vendor allowances to reflect the newly adopted accounting principle established in EITF Issue No.02-16 .
The related after-tax, non-cash charge of $42 also is reflected in our fiscal 2003 first quarter financial results as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Refer to Note1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Condensed Consolidating FinancialInformation Our convertible debentures are guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. The aggregate principal amount at maturity of these convertible debentures is $894million. The carrying value of the convertible debentures at February28, 2004, was approximately $755million.
Additional information regarding the convertible debentures is included in Note4, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report on Form10-K.
On June16, 2003, we sold our interest in Musicland. The statement of earnings for the year ended February28, 2004, includes a loss on disposal of discontinued operations (which was primarily non-cash) of $66million, net of tax, related to the sale of Musicland. In addition, approximately $198million of Musicland's intercompany indebtedness to Best Buy Co.,Inc. was eliminated in fiscal 2004. This resulted in a loss of $198million that was recorded in Best Buy Co.,Inc. with an offsetting $198million gain recorded in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, which included Musicland. The elimination of intercompany indebtedness had no impact on our consolidated net earnings, financial position or cash flows. Additional information regarding Musicland is included in Note2, Discontinued Operations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report on Form10-K.
Effective March2, 2003, we revised our legal entity structure. This change resulted in including certain assets and liabilities, operating results and cash flows in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries column that in prior periods had been recorded in the Best Buy Co.,Inc. or Guarantor Subsidiaries columns. The change had no impact on our consolidated net earnings, financial position or cash flows. The Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements for periods prior to March2, 2003, have not been revised to reflect this change.
We filea consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Beginning with fiscal 2004, income taxes are allocated in accordance with our tax allocation agreement. U.S. affiliates receive no tax benefit for taxable losses, but are allocated taxes at the required effective tax rate if they have taxableincome.
