Information About Our Segments During fiscal 2011, we operated two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S., operating under various brand names including, but not limited to, BestBuy, BestBuy Mobile, Geek Squad, Magnolia Audio Video, Napster and Pacific Sales.

Financial information about our segments is included in Item7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , and Note12, Segment and Geographic Information , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Domestic Segment We were incorporated in the state of Minnesota in 1966 as Sound of Music, Inc. We began as an audio components retailer and, with the introduction of the videocassette recorder in the early 1980s, expanded into video products. In 1983, we changed our name to BestBuy Co., Inc. and began using mass-merchandising techniques, which included offering a wider variety of products and operating stores under a "superstore" concept. In 1989, we dramatically changed our method of retailing by introducing a self-service, noncommissioned, discount-style store concept designed to give the customer a variety of brands and more control over the purchasing process. Today, our U.S. BestBuy stores operate a model whereby we offer our customers a wide variety of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment products, appliances and related services with variations on product assortments, staffing, promotions and store design to address specific customer groups and local market needs.
In fiscal 2001, we acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc. a Seattle-based, high-end retailer of audio and video products and services to access an upscale customer segment. In fiscal 2005, we began operating Magnolia Home Theater store-within-a-store experiences in U.S. BestBuy stores, offering customers high-end electronics with specially trained employees.
In fiscal 2003, we acquired Geek Squad Inc. Geek Squad provides repair, support and installation services. We acquired Geek Squad to further our plans of providing technology support services to customers. Geek Squad service is available in all U.S. BestBuy branded stores.
4 Table of Contents In fiscal 2007, we acquired California-based Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath Centers, Inc. ("Pacific Sales"). Pacific Sales specializes in the sale and installation of high-end and mass-market premium brand kitchen appliances, plumbing fixtures and home entertainment products, with a focus on builders and remodelers.
In fiscal 2007, we also developed the BestBuy Mobile concept through a management consulting agreement with U.K.-based The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC ("CPW"). BestBuy Mobile provides a comprehensive assortment of mobile phones, accessories and related services using experienced sales personnel, now in all U.S. BestBuy stores, as well as stand-alone stores.
In fiscal 2008, we acquired Speakeasy Inc. ("Speakeasy"). Speakeasy provides broadband, voice, data and information technology services to small businesses. During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we completed the sale of our Speakeasy business to Covad Communications Group.
In fiscal 2009, we acquired Napster, Inc. Napster provides a comprehensive digital music service offering, including digital music downloads and on-demand streaming capabilities.
International Segment Our International segment was established in fiscal 2002 in connection with our acquisition of Future Shop Ltd., Canada's largest consumer electronics retailer.
During fiscal 2003, we launched our dual-branding strategy in Canada by introducing the BestBuy brand. The dual-branding strategy allows us to retain Future Shop's brand equity and attract more customers by offering a choice of distinct store experiences.
In fiscal 2007, we acquired a 75% interest in Jiangsu Five Star Appliance Co., Ltd. ("Five Star"), one of China's largest appliance and consumer electronics retailers. We made the investment in Five Star to further our international growth plans, to increase our knowledge of Chinese customers and to obtain an immediate retail presence in China. We also opened our first BestBuy branded store in China, located in Shanghai, in fiscal 2007. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in Five Star.
In fiscal 2009, we acquired a 50% share in BestBuy Europe Distributions Limited ("BestBuy Europe"). BestBuy Europe is a venture with CPW, consisting of CPW's former retail and distribution business with over 2,400 small-format The Carphone Warehouse and The Phone House stores, online channels, device insurance operations, and mobile and fixed-line telecommunication services. The transaction also included CPW's economic interest in both BestBuy Mobile in the U.S. and Geek Squad in the U.K. and Spain. We made the investment in Best Buy Europe to further our international growth plans, to increase our knowledge of European customers and to obtain an immediate retail presence in Europe. During fiscal 2011, we launched large-format BestBuy branded stores in the U.K. and a related online channel in the European market.
In fiscal 2009, we also expanded our BestBuy Mobile operations to Canada by opening stand-alone stores. We now also offer the BestBuy Mobile store-within-a-store experience in all Canadian BestBuy branded stores. Also in fiscal 2009, we opened our first BestBuy branded store in Mexico, located in Mexico City.
In fiscal 2010, we opened our first BestBuy branded store in Turkey, located in Izmir.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we announced plans to exit the Turkey market and restructure the BestBuy branded stores in China during fiscal 2012. The exit from the Turkey market includes exiting of all current operations in that country, including its two BestBuy branded stores. Restructuring activities in China include closing all eight BestBuy branded stores. We also intend to explore other more profitable growth options for the BestBuy brand in China, including the option to reopen two of the closed stores at a later date.
In order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions, we consolidate the financial results of our Europe, China, Mexico and Turkey operations on a two-month lag. Consistent 5 Table of Contents with such consolidation, the financial and non-financial information presented in this Annual Report on Form10-K relative to our Europe, China, Mexico and Turkey operations is also presented on a two-month lag.
Operations Domestic Segment Our Domestic segment store operations are organized by store brand. U.S. Best Buy store operations are divided into districts and are under the management of a retail field officer who oversees store performance through district managers. District managers monitor U.S. BestBuy store operations and meet regularly with store managers to discuss merchandising, new product introductions, sales promotions, customer loyalty programs, employee satisfaction surveys and store operating performance.
Our U.S. BestBuy, U.S. BestBuy Mobile, Magnolia Audio Video, Pacific Sales and Geek Squad stores have developed procedures for inventory management, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, product sales and services, staff training and merchandise display that are standardized within each store brand. Corporate retail management for each store brand generally controls advertising, merchandise purchasing and pricing, as well as inventory policies. All stores within each store brand generally operate in the same manner under the standard procedures adjusted to local customer needs.
International Segment Located throughout nine European countries, The Carphone Warehouse and The Phone House stores are significantly smaller than our BestBuy branded stores and employ sales associates that provide independent advice on the best service and hardware suited to each customer. Most phone sales require in-store registration with the mobile phone network operator facilitated by our employees, allowing the customer to leave the store with a fully active phone and a service contract. Advertising, merchandise purchasing and pricing and inventory policies for these stores are controlled by corporate retail management in each respective local market.
Canada store operations are organized to support two principal brands. Future Shop stores have predominantly commissioned sales associates who take a proactive role in assisting customers and driving the transaction, whereas employees in BestBuy branded stores in Canada, like employees in U.S. BestBuy stores, are noncommissioned, allowing the customers to drive the transaction through interactive displays and grab-and-go merchandising. Each brand has national management that closely monitors store operations. All Canada stores use a standardized operating system that includes procedures for inventory management, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, staff training and merchandise display. Advertising, merchandise purchasing and pricing and inventory policies are centrally controlled. Our Best Buy Mobile stores in Canada employ an operating model similar to that used in our U.S. BestBuy Mobile stores.
China store operations are also organized to support two principal brands. Our Five Star stores primarily utilize vendor employees and full-time sales associates to sell our products. Our BestBuy branded stores in China have employed an operating model similar to BestBuy branded stores in the U.S. However, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we announced plans to restructure the BestBuy branded stores in China during fiscal 2012. Corporate retail management for each store brand generally controls advertising, merchandise purchasing and pricing, and inventory policies, although management for individual regions within our Five Star brand may vary these operations locally to adapt to customer needs. We anticipate consolidating the support operations for the BestBuy branded stores in China with the existing Five Star business as a part of the announced restructuring of such stores.
Our BestBuy branded stores in the U.K., Mexico and Turkey employ an operating model similar to that used in our U.S. BestBuy stores. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we announced plans to exit the Turkey market during fiscal 2012.

Distribution Domestic Segment Generally, U.S. BestBuy, U.S. BestBuy Mobile, Magnolia Audio Video and Pacific Sales stores' merchandise, except for major appliances and large-screen televisions, is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers located throughout the U.S. Major appliances and large-screen televisions are shipped to satellite warehouses in each major market. These stores are dependent upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment of most merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected products and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to our stores from manufacturers and distributors. Contract carriers ship merchandise from the distribution centers to stores, though Pacific Sales stores' merchandise is generally fulfilled directly to customers through two distribution centers in California. Generally, U.S. BestBuy online merchandise sales are either picked up at U.S. BestBuy stores or fulfilled directly to customers through our distribution centers.
International Segment Our small-format The Carphone Warehouse and The Phone House stores' merchandise is shipped directly from our suppliers to our distribution centers across Europe. Contract carriers ship merchandise from the distribution centers to stores. Stores hold the immediate stock requirement and the distribution center in each market holds additional inventory. Our large-format BestBuy branded stores in the U.K. have distribution methods similar to that of our U.S. Best Buy stores.
Our Canada stores' merchandise is shipped directly from our suppliers to our distribution centers in British Columbia and Ontario. Our Canada stores are dependent upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment of most merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected products and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to our stores from manufacturers and distributors. Contract carriers ship merchandise from the distribution centers to stores.
We receive our Five Star stores' merchandise at more than 40 distribution centers and warehouses located throughout the Five Star retail chain, the largest of which is located in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. Our Five Star stores are dependent 8 Table of Contents upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and the shipment of most merchandise to our stores or customers. Large merchandise, such as major appliances, is generally fulfilled directly to customers through our distribution centers and warehouses.
Merchandise for our BestBuy branded stores in China is shipped directly from our suppliers to our distribution center in Shanghai.

In certain circumstances, merchandise is shipped directly to our customers from manufacturers and distributors.
Our BestBuy branded stores in Mexico and Turkey have distribution methods similar to that of our U.S. BestBuy stores.
Suppliers Our strategy depends, in part, upon our ability to offer customers a broad selection of name-brand products and, therefore, our success is dependent upon satisfactory and stable supplier relationships. In fiscal 2011, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for just under 65% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers Apple, Samsung, Sony, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba representing 39% of total merchandise purchased. The loss of or disruption in supply from any one of these major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our major suppliers that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. We have no indication that any of our suppliers plan to discontinue selling us merchandise. We have not experienced significant difficulty in maintaining satisfactory sources of supply, and we generally expect that adequate sources of supply will continue to exist for the types of merchandise we sell.
We operate a global sourcing office in China in order to design, develop, test and contract manufacture our own line of exclusive brand products in association with factories in Asia.
Store Development The addition of new stores has played a significant role in our growth and success. Our store development program has historically focused on testing stores in new markets; adding stores within existing markets; and relocating, remodeling and expanding existing stores in order to offer new products and services to our customers. We actively monitor our existing store portfolio, and where necessary, take steps to grow, modify, enhance, relocate or close those stores based on our judgment of future potential returns.
In our Domestic segment, we will continue to focus on enhancing existing stores to target high growth value propositions, increasing our presence in small-format stores like BestBuy Mobile, and moderating large-format store square footage growth. In our International segment, store investments will focus on growth areas such as Five Star in China, as well as selectively expanding the number of BestBuy branded stores in the relatively new markets of the U.K. and Mexico.
Domestic Segment During fiscal 2011, we opened 134 new stores and closed seven stores in our Domestic segment. We offer Geek Squad support services and the BestBuy Mobile store-within-a-store experience in all U.S. BestBuy stores.

Our working capital needs are typically greatest in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventories in advance of expected sales.
Customers We do not have a significant concentration of sales with any individual customer and, therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material impact on our business. No single customer has accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue.
Backlog Our stores, call centers and online shopping sites do not have a material amount of backlog orders.
Government Contracts No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government or government agencies or affiliates.
Competition Our primary competitors are discount chains, consumer electronics retailers including vendors who offer their products direct to the consumer, wholesale clubs, home-improvement superstores and internet-based businesses.
We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people, store and online experience, broad product assortment, distinct store formats and brand marketing strategies differentiate us from our competitors by positioning our stores and Web sites as the preferred destination for new technology and entertainment products in a fun and informative shopping environment.
Research and Development We have not engaged in any material research and development activities during the past three fiscal years.
Environmental Matters While seeking and discovering new and innovative ways to engage our customers in the connected world, we also strive to lessen our impact on the environment. Our energy efficiency strategy includes end-to-end efforts to reduce energy use in our own internal operations and of the products and services we offer our customers. And with an expanding selection of our internally developed exclusive brand products, we continue to make efforts to provide products that use less energy, are made of non-toxic materials and are packaged in more responsible ways.
Our energy efficient practices include a centralized automated energy management system for our U.S. BestBuy stores and retail energy reports by store. Lighting and HVAC upgrades, as well as aiming to build new stores to Leadership in Energy& Environmental Design ("LEED") standards, are also part of our continuing efforts. These energy efficiency improvements have helped us reduce our own carbon footprint. In calendar 2010, we set a new long-term goal of reducing our carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by 2020 (over a 2009 baseline). During calendar 2010, we reduced our total carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 0.5% in our U.S. BestBuy stores over the previous year. However, given that our total square footage increased by 2.9% in calendar 2010, the 0.5% reduction represented a 3.2% reduction on a per square foot basis.
12 Table of Contents Increasing consumer demand for environmentally friendly products and services has led us to provide new energy efficient products and a means to recycle old products. We helped our U.S. BestBuy customers purchase over 22million ENERGY STAR qualified products in calendar 2010 and encouraged our vendors to participate in the ENERGY STAR program. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that our sales of these products in calendar 2010 resulted in customer savings of 1.12billion kilowatt hours of energy, generating over $120million in electric utility bill savings, while preventing over 1.7billion pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. As part of our strategy, we are also investing in emerging technologies such as home energy management systems for all the connected devices in a home, renewable energy technologies and electric transportation.
In addition, in calendar 2009, we launched a nationwide consumer electronics take-back program where customers can bring many consumer electronics products to our stores for free recycling. This recycling program is available in all U.S. BestBuy stores. We also collect old, inefficient appliances for recycling through a haul-away program. In fiscal 2011, our recycling program collected approximately 83million pounds of consumer electronics and approximately 73million pounds of old appliances, reducing the amount of electronic waste that would otherwise have been sent to landfills. These efforts marked an 11% increase over the 140million combined pounds of consumer electronics and appliances collected in fiscal 2010.
Continued efforts to be more environmentally conscious in our exclusive brands packaging focused on the use of recycled materials, non-solvent coatings and organic inks where possible. Through a variety of opportunities, we reduced plastic usage by 745tons and eliminated 890tons of PVC within our exclusive brands packaging during fiscal 2011.
We are not aware of any federal, state or local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that have materially affected, or are reasonably expected to materially affect, our net earnings or competitive position, or have resulted or are reasonably expected to result in material capital expenditures. See Item1A, Risk Factors , for additional discussion.
We believe we can continue to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions in cost effective ways that deliver value to our shareholders, customers, employees and the communities we serve, whether it's in our own internal operations or through our work to connect customers with more energy efficient solutions.
Number of Employees At the end of fiscal 2011, we employed approximately 180,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees worldwide. We consider our employee relations to be good. We offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits that vary within our company due to customary local practices and statutory requirements, which we believe are competitive in the aggregate relative to others in our industry.
Financial Information About Geographic Areas We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International.

Investor Relations Department 7601 Penn Avenue South Richfield, MN 55423-3645 Item1A. Risk Factors.
Described below are certain risks that our management believes are applicable to our business and the industry in which we operate. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form10-K.
If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. The following risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf related to conditions or events that we anticipate may occur in the future. The following risks should not be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.
Economic conditions in the U.S. and key international markets, a decline in consumer discretionary spending or other conditions may materially adversely impact our operating results.
We sell certain products and services that consumers may view as discretionary items rather than necessities. As a result, our results of operations tend to be more sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Challenging macroeconomic conditions also impact our customers' ability to obtain consumer credit in a timely manner, if at all. Other factors, including consumer confidence, employment levels, interest rates, tax rates, consumer debt levels, and fuel and energy costs could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. In the past three fiscal years, many of these factors adversely affected consumer spending and, consequently, our business and results of operations. A slowdown in the U.S. or global economy, or an uncertain economic outlook, could materially adversely affect consumer spending habits and our operating results in the future.
The domestic and international political situation also affects consumer confidence. The threat or outbreak of domestic or international terrorism or other hostilities could lead to a decrease in consumer spending. Any of these events and factors 14 Table of Contents could cause a decrease in revenue or an increase in inventory markdowns or certain operating expenses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
Other conditions or factors that may impact our results of operations include disruptions to the availability of content such as sporting events or other televised content. Such disruptions may influence the demand for hardware that our customers purchase to access such content, as well as the commissions we receive from subscription services. Accordingly, such disruptions could cause a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.
If we do not anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner, our operating results could materially suffer.
Our business depends, in large part, on our ability to successfully introduce new products, services and technologies to consumers, the frequency of such introductions, the level of consumer acceptance, and the related impact on the demand for existing products, services and technologies. Failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions, or to effectively address consumer concerns, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and reputation with our customers.
Our results of operations could materially deteriorate if we fail to attract, develop and retain qualified employees.
Our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees who are able to meet the wants and needs of our customers. We believe our competitive advantage is providing unique end-to-end solutions for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store, service and administrative personnel. The turnover rate in the retail industry is high, and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand initiatives related to the connected world, our exclusive brands and our international operations. Delayed store openings, significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We face strong competition from traditional store-based retailers, internet-based businesses, our vendors and other forms of retail commerce, which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.
The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for customers, employees, locations, products and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional, national and international retailers, as well as our vendors who offer their products and services direct to the consumer. Pressure from our competitors, some of which have greater market presence and financial resources than we do, could require us to reduce our prices or increase our costs of doing business. Furthermore, our business model includes offering our customers packaged value propositions that take the complexity out of managing devices, content and connectivity. Some of our vendors also continue to interact directly with customers by embedding their services into the products we sell. As a result of this competition and potential product disintermediation, we may experience lower revenue and/or higher operating costs, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
Our results of operations could materially deteriorate if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition.
We operate a global portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands continue to drive our growth. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in declines in customer loyalty, lower employee morale and productivity concerns, and vendor relationship issues, and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
15 Table of Contents The failure to control our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.
Consumer spending remains uncertain, which makes it more challenging for us to maintain or grow our operating income rate. As a result, we must continue to control our expense structure. Failure to manage our labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating lease costs, other store expenses or indirect spending could delay or prevent us from achieving increased profitability or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
Our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets.
We must have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance investment opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue promising business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under credit facilities and other debt financings.
If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may have to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings, as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of us or the retail industry generally. If required, we may not be able to obtain additional financing, on favorable terms, or at all.
Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital markets and materially increase our borrowing costs.
In fiscal 2011, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard& Poor's Ratings Services maintained their ratings and outlook of our debt securities at above investment grade level, while Fitch Ratings Ltd. reaffirmed its rating of our debt securities as BBB+ but raised its outlook to stable. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2011, Fitch Ratings Ltd. reaffirmed its rating of our debt securities, but revised its outlook to negative.
Future downgrades to our long-term credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact our access to the capital markets and the perception of us by lenders and other third parties. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may review the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including as a result of new standards requiring the agencies to re-assess rating practices and methodologies.
Any downgrade to our debt securities may result in higher interest costs for certain of our credit facilities and other debt financings, and could result in higher interest costs on future financings. Further, in the event of such a downgrade, we may not be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms, or at all.
Our growth is dependent on the success of our strategies.
Our growth is dependent on our ability to identify, develop and execute our strategies. Our failure to properly deploy and utilize capital and other resources may adversely affect our initiatives designed to assist our customers connect to a digital lifestyle, while expanding our footprint globally. While we believe our customer centricity and connected world initiatives, as well as the pursuit of international growth opportunities, will enable us to grow our business, misjudgments or flaws in our execution could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our growth strategy includes expanding our business by opening stores in both existing markets and new markets.
Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build, buy or lease new stores. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use, local zoning issues, environmental regulations and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and also influence the cost of building, buying and leasing our stores. We also may have difficulty negotiating real estate purchase agreements and leases on acceptable terms. Failure to manage effectively these and other similar factors will affect our ability to build, buy and lease new stores, which may have a material adverse effect on our future profitability.
16 Table of Contents We may seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share. Because our stores typically draw customers from their local areas, a new store may draw customers away from our nearby existing stores and may cause customer traffic and comparable store sales performance to decline at those existing stores.
We also open stores in new markets from time to time. The risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting customers where there is a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences, seasonal differences in the market and our ability to obtain the necessary governmental approvals. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot ensure that our new stores will be profitably deployed. As a result, our future profitability may be materially adversely affected.
Failure in our pursuit or execution of new business ventures, strategic alliances and acquisitions could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Our growth strategy also includes expansion via new business ventures, strategic alliances and acquisitions. Assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence. However, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited, and we can give no assurance that new business ventures, strategic alliances and acquisitions will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned. Integrating new businesses, stores and concepts can be a difficult task. Cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in customers in those markets being less receptive than originally anticipated. These types of transactions may divert our capital and our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities. Further, implementing new strategic alliances or business ventures may also impair our relationships with our vendors or strategic partners. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. We may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. If we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and operating results could suffer materially. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to impairment of the associated goodwill and intangible asset balances.
Failure to protect the integrity, security and use of our customers' information and media could expose us to litigation and materially damage our standing with our customers.
The use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the state, federal and international levels. Increasing costs associated with information security such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws and costs resulting from consumer fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. While we have taken significant steps to protect customer and confidential information, there can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and personal data. If any such compromise of our security were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition. Any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk.
Risks associated with the vendors from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our revenue and gross profit.
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. Our 20 largest suppliers account for just under 65% of the merchandise we purchase. If any of our key vendors fails to supply us with products or continue to develop new technologies that create consumer demand, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our revenue could materially decline. We require all of our vendors to comply with applicable laws, 17 Table of Contents including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required vendor standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work stoppages, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our revenue and gross profit.
Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Sales of our exclusive brands, which primarily include Insignia, Dynex, Init, Geek Squad and Rocketfish branded products, represent a growing component of our revenue. Most of these products are manufactured under contract by vendors based in southeastern Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results:  We have greater exposure and responsibility to the consumer for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of product defects, as we generally have no recourse to contracted manufacturers for such warranty liabilities;  We may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by such products, some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls;  We may experience disruptions in the manufacturing or the logistics within the manufacturing environment in southeastern Asia caused by inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns or if we are unable to develop long-term relationships with key factories;  We are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;  We may be subject to claims by technology owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our products; and  We may be unable to obtain or adequately protect our patents and other intellectual property rights on our products, the new features of our products and/or our processes.
We are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Our statutory, regulatory and legal environment exposes us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results. The most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:  The difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;  The impact of new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform, environmental requirements, labor reform, health care reform, corporate governance matters and/or other as yet unknown legislation, that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;  The impact of changes in tax laws (or interpretations thereof by courts and taxing authorities) and accounting standards; and  The impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters.
18 Table of Contents Defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters.
Changes to the National Labor Relations Act or other labor-related statutes or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business.
The National Labor Relations Board is considering changes to labor regulations which could significantly impact the nature of labor relations in the U.S. and how union elections and contract negotiations are conducted. At February26, 2011, none of our U.S. stores had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements. Changes in labor-related statutes or regulations could make it easier for unions to be formed, and employers of newly unionized employees may face mandatory, binding arbitration of labor scheduling, costs and standards, which could increase our costs of doing business and materially adversely affect our results of operations.
Additional legislation or rulemaking relating to environmental matters, including but not limited to, energy emissions, could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Environmental legislation or rulemaking efforts could impose unexpected costs or impact us more directly than other companies due to our operations as a global consumer electronics retailer with over 4,000 stores and 90 distribution centers worldwide.
Specifically, legislation that aims to control and reduce energy emissions has been considered by the U.S. Congress as well as governing bodies internationally, particularly in Europe. Should such legislation pass, we anticipate that energy costs within our operations would increase such as the expense to power our stores. In addition, rulemaking is being considered that could impose higher safety and compliance standards on transporting certain goods. Any significant rulemaking could increase the cost to transport our goods. Passage of any such legislation or rulemaking could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
Regulatory developments in the U.S. could impact the promotional financing offers available to our credit card customers and have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability .
We offer promotional financing in the U.S. through credit cards issued by third party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. The cardholders can receive low- or no-interest promotional financing on qualifying purchases. Promotional financing credit card sales accounted for 18%, 17% and 18% of our Domestic segment's revenue in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Recent economic developments, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in increased legislative and regulatory actions affecting credit cards. Recently enacted legislative and regulatory changes that focus on a variety of credit-related matters, such as the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 ("Credit CARD Act"), included new rules and restrictions affecting interest rates, penalties and fees, contract terms, credit limits, billing practices and payment application. While we believe that neither the Credit CARD Act nor other recently enacted legislation or regulation related to credit matters have had a material adverse impact on our operations to date, if future legislative or regulatory restrictions or prohibitions arise that affect our ability to offer promotional financing and we are unable to adjust our operations in a timely manner, our revenue and profitability may be materially adversely affected.
Changes to our credit card agreements could adversely impact our ability to facilitate the provision of consumer credit to our customers and could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
We have agreements with third party banks for the issuance of promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards bearing the BestBuy brand. Under the agreements, the banks manage and directly extend credit to our customers. The banks are the sole owner of the accounts receivable generated under the credit card programs and absorb losses associated with non-payment by the cardholders and fraudulent usage of the accounts. We earn revenue from fees the banks pay to us based on the number of credit card accounts activated and card usage. The banks also reimburse us for 19 Table of Contents certain costs associated with our credit card programs. Financing fees are paid by us to the banks and are variable based on certain factors such as the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), charge volume and/or the types of promotional financing offers.
Given the continuing changes in the economic and regulatory environment for banks, as well as a continuing period of consumer credit delinquencies, banks continue to re-evaluate their lending practices and terms, including, but not limited to, the levels at which consumer credit is granted. If any of our credit card programs ended prematurely or the terms and provisions, or interpretations thereof, were substantially modified, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted.
Our International activities subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance .
We have a presence in various foreign countries including Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Republic of Mauritius, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, Turks and Caicos, and the U.K. During fiscal 2011, our International segment's operations generated 26% of our revenue. Our growth strategy includes expansion of existing international markets and possible expansion into new international markets. Accordingly, our International segment's operations may account for a larger portion of our revenue in the future. Our future operating results in these countries and in other countries or regions throughout the world where we may operate in the future could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including political conditions, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints and foreign currency regulations.
In addition, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future earnings and cash flows from our International segment's operations, and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they were to occur again, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may materially adversely impact our International segment's operations include foreign trade, monetary, tax and fiscal policies both of the U.S. and of other countries; laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations; and maintaining facilities in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S.
Additional risks inherent in our International segment's operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.
We rely heavily on our management information systems for inventory management, distribution and other functions. If our systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if we experience an interruption in their operation, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to manage our order entry, order fulfillment, pricing, point-of-sale and inventory replenishment processes. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate, or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business, could disrupt our business and could result in decreased revenue, increased overhead costs and excess or out-of-stock inventory levels, causing our business and results of operations to suffer materially.
20 Table of Contents A disruption in relationships with key third-party business partners could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
We have engaged Accenture LLP ("Accenture"), a global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company, to manage significant portions of our information technology and human resources operations as well as to conduct certain procurement activities. We rely heavily on our management information systems for inventory management, distribution and other functions. We also rely heavily on human resources support to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. We also use Accenture to provide procurement support to research and purchase certain non-merchandise products and services. Furthermore, we have engaged other key third-party business partners to manage various functions of our business, including but not limited to, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, customer warranty and insurance programs, and other outsourced functions. Any material disruption in our relationship with Accenture or other key third-party business partners could result in decreased revenue and increased overhead costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer materially.
We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday selling season.
Approximately one-third of our revenue and more than one-half of our net earnings are generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Europe and Canada. Unexpected events or developments such as natural or man-made disasters, product sourcing issues or adverse economic conditions in our fourth fiscal quarter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Item3. Legal Proceedings.
In December 2005, a purported class action lawsuit captioned, Jasmen Holloway, et al. v. BestBuyCo., Inc ., was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. This federal court action alleges that we discriminate against women and minority individuals on the basis of gender, race, color and/or national origin in our stores with respect to our employment policies and practices. The action seeks an end to alleged discriminatory policies and practices, an award of back and front pay, punitive damages and injunctive relief, including rightful place relief for all class members. The plaintiffs have filed a class certification motion which we have opposed. All proceedings have been stayed pending a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Dukes, et al. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
, a gender discrimination class action lawsuit.
25 Table of Contents In February 2011, a purported class action lawsuit captioned, IBEW Local 98 Pension Fund, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. BestBuy Co., Inc., et al ., was filed against us and certain of our executive officers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. This federal court action alleges, among other things, that we and those officers violated Sections10(b) and 20A of the Exchange Act and Rule10b-5 under the Exchange Act in connection with press releases and other statements relating to our fiscal 2011 earnings guidance that had been made available to the public. Additionally, in March 2011, a similar purported class action was filed by a single shareholder, Rene LeBlanc, against us and certain of our executive officers in the same court.
The plaintiffs in the above actions seek damages, including interest, equitable relief and reimbursement of the costs and expenses they incurred in the lawsuits. We believe the above allegations are without merit, and we intend to defend these actions vigorously. Based on our assessment of the facts underlying the claims in the above actions, their respective procedural litigation history (including the status of class certification in the Holloway lawsuit), and the degree to which we intend to defend our company in these matters, we are unable to provide meaningful quantification of how the final resolution of these claims may impact our future consolidated financial position or results of operations.
We are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of conducting business. We believe the amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. The resolution of those other proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Market Information Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BBY. The table below sets forth the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index during the periods indicated.
Sales Price High Low Fiscal 2011 First Quarter $ 48.83 $ 36.28 Second Quarter 42.65 30.90 Third Quarter 45.63 31.32 Fourth Quarter 44.62 32.00 Fiscal 2010 First Quarter $ 42.06 $ 23.97 Second Quarter 39.98 31.25 Third Quarter 44.32 35.66 Fourth Quarter 45.55 35.01 Holders As of April20, 2011, there were 3,305 holders of record of our common stock.
Dividends In fiscal 2004, our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend with respect to shares of our common stock. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter. Our quarterly cash dividend for all of fiscal 2010 and for the first two quarters of fiscal 2011 was $0.14 per share, and for the last two quarters of fiscal 2011 was $0.15 per share. The payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions.
Future dividend payments will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by our Board.
Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers From time to time, we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our Board. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, such as acquiring shares to offset dilution related to equity-based incentives, including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, and optimizing our capital structure.
In June 2007, our Board authorized up to $5.5billion of share repurchases. The program, which became effective on June26, 2007, terminated and replaced a $1.5billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2006. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the June 2007 program. We made no share repurchases in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased and retired 32.6million shares at a cost of $1.2billion. At the end of fiscal 2011, $1.3billion of the $5.5billion share repurchases authorized by our Board in June 2007 was available for future share repurchases.
29 Table of Contents We consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among other things, our cash needs, the availability of funding and the market price of our stock. We expect that cash provided by future operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, will be the sources of funding for our share repurchase program. Based on the anticipated amounts to be generated from those sources of funds in relation to the remaining authorization approved by our Board under the June 2007 share repurchase program, we do not expect that future share repurchases will have a material impact on our short-term or long-term liquidity.
The following table presents the total number of shares of our common stock that we purchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the average price paid per share, the number of shares that we purchased as part of our publicly announced repurchase program, and the approximate dollar value of shares that still could have been purchased at the end of the applicable fiscal period, pursuant to our June 2007 share repurchase program: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (1) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) November28, 2010, through January1, 2011  $   $ 1,372,000,000 January2, 2011, through January29, 2011    1,372,000,000 January30, 2011, through February26, 2011 1,855,740 35.66 1,855,740 1,307,000,000 Total Fiscal 2011 Fourth Quarter 1,855,740 35.66 1,855,740 1,307,000,000 (1) "Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs" reflects our $5.5billion share repurchase program announced on June27, 2007, less the $3.0billion we purchased in fiscal 2008 under our accelerated share repurchase program and the $1.2billion we purchased in fiscal 2011.

These charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income rate of 0.5% of revenue for the fiscal year.
(2) Included within our operating income and net earnings for fiscal 2010 is $52 ($25 net of taxes and noncontrolling interest) of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal first quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. These charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income rate of 0.1% of revenue for the fiscal year.
(3) Included within our operating income and net earnings for fiscal 2009 is $78 ($48 net of tax) of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. In addition, operating income is inclusive of goodwill and tradename impairment charges of $66 ($64 net of tax) related to our former Speakeasy business. Collectively, these charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income rate of 0.2% of revenue for the fiscal year.
(4) Included within our net earnings for fiscal 2009 is $111 ($96 net of tax) of investment impairment charges related to our investment in the common stock of CPW.
(5) Fiscal 2007 included 53weeks. All other periods presented included 52weeks.
32 Table of Contents (6) Comparable store sales is a measure commonly used in the retail industry, which indicates store performance by measuring the growth in revenue for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales is comprised of revenue from stores operating for at least 14 full months as well as revenue related to call centers, Web sites and our other comparable sales channels. Revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers or dealers is not included within our comparable store sales calculation. Relocated, remodeled and expanded stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The portion of our calculation of the comparable store sales percentage change attributable to our International segment excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods.
(7) The current ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities.
(8) As a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance related to the treatment of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, we recharacterized minority interests previously reported on our consolidated balance sheets as noncontrolling interests and classified them as a component of shareholders' equity. As a result, we have reclassified total shareholders' equity for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 to include noncontrolling interests of $513, $40 and $35, respectively.
(9) In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we acquired 2,414stores pursuant to our acquisition of a 50% interest in BestBuy Europe.
33 Table of Contents Item7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. Our MD&A is presented in seven sections:  Overview  Business Strategy and Core Philosophies  Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  Critical Accounting Estimates  New Accounting Standards In order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions, we consolidate the financial results of our Europe, China, Mexico and Turkey operations on a two-month lag. Consistent with such consolidation, the financial and non-financial information presented in our MD&A relative to these operations is also presented on a two-month lag.
Our policy is to accelerate recording the effect of events occurring in the lag period that significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. Except for our fiscal 2011 restructuring, for which we recorded the effects of certain restructuring charges, no significant intervening event occurred in these operations that would have materially affected our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or other factors had it been recorded during fiscal 2011. Accordingly, the $171 million of restructuring charges related to our International segment were included in our fiscal 2011 results.
Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of February. Fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 each included 52weeks.
Overview We are a multi-national retailer of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment products, appliances and related services. We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of all operations within the U.S. and its territories. The International segment is comprised of all operations outside the U.S. and its territories.
Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. Historically, we have realized more of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Europe and Canada, than in any other fiscal quarter.
While some of the products and services we offer are viewed by consumers as essential, others continue to be viewed as discretionary purchases. Consequently, our results of operations are susceptible to changes in consumer confidence levels and macroeconomic factors such as unemployment, consumer credit availability and the condition of the housing market. Recently, consumers have maintained a cautious approach to discretionary spending due to continued economic pressures. Consequently, customer traffic and spending patterns continue to be difficult to predict. Other factors that directly impact our performance are product life-cycle shifts (including the adoption of new technology) and the competitive consumer electronics retail environment. As a result of these factors, predicting our future revenue and net 34 Table of Contents earnings is difficult. Disciplined capital allocation and working capital management and expense control remain key priorities for us as we navigate through the current environment. By providing access to a wide selection of consumer electronics products and accessories; a vast array of service offerings, such as extended warranties, installation and repair; and a knowledgeable sales staff to help our customers select and connect their devices, we believe we offer our customers a differentiated value proposition.
Throughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable store sales. Comparable store sales is a measure commonly used in the retail industry, which indicates store performance by measuring the growth in revenue for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales is comprised of revenue from stores operating for at least 14 full months, as well as revenue related to call centers, Web sites and our other comparable sales channels. Revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers or dealers is not included within our comparable store sales calculation. Relocated, remodeled and expanded stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The portion of our calculation of the comparable store sales percentage change attributable to our International segment excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods.
In our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our International segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the International segment's operating results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior-year period's currency exchange rates. We use this method for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
Business Strategy and Core Philosophies Broadly defined, our Connected World strategy is based on the goal to demystify and humanize technology to help customers get the most out of the rapidly expanding role that technology plays in their lives. The assets we leverage to bring this strategy to life include our approximately 180,000 employees around the world and the dedication and expertise they bring; valuable relationships with our vendors; our brand names and reputation; and our unique multi-channel model which provides customer touch point opportunities through retail store locations, Web sites, mobile applications and call centers.
The Connected World gives us access to a much larger addressable market than just the traditional consumer electronics hardware market. While a large part of the traditional focus of our business has been on consumer electronics products, we have significant incremental opportunities in selling accessories, content, connections and services.
Our three primary strategic priorities are: Capture New Growth Opportunities and Target Online Opportunities .The unrelenting pace of change in technology provides both opportunities and challenges for our customers, and we believe we are well positioned to help them navigate through these and to enrich their lives through the use of technology.
Our current growth priorities include continuing the recent expansion in Best Buy Mobile, mobile computing (particularly with the growing selection of tablet computers) and increasing our market share in appliances and gaming. In addition, we believe our customers will increasingly appreciate our Geek Squad service offerings and innovative purchase options, such as the recently-launched "Buy Back" program in the U.S. Finally, we foresee opportunities for increasing the number of connections we sell, a vital proposition to our customers wishing to access people and content such as streaming 35 Table of Contents movies and music, internet and television. This opportunity is most prevalent today in mobile phones, but also in connecting computing devices to mobile broadband and televisions to broadband services.
We believe that our established multi-channel strategy provides us competitive advantages in that it allows customers to connect with us in a variety of ways. For example, customers can interact with us directly through our store, online, mobile application or call center channels or through a combination of channels, such as purchasing online for in-store pick up. We plan to continue to leverage these capabilities to offer consumers options that are flexible and convenient. Our online growth plans also include allowing external vendors and retailers to sell through our Web sites, extending our reach by allowing partners to market our products and services and leveraging online traffic to sell advertising.
Improve Growth and Returns in International Markets .Our international strategy is focused on four key geographic areas (Canada, China, Europe and Mexico), where we believe we can leverage size, scale and economics to succeed. In China, we expect to continue investment in profitable growth as we look to grow our position in this fast growing market through our Five Star business. In our established businesses in Canada and Europe (small-format stores), we plan to continue our evolution into Connected World solutions. In our relatively new markets such as the U.K. (large-format stores) and Mexico, our growth will likely be more measured, as we increase our understanding and appreciation for customers' needs in these markets.
Drive Structural Opportunities to Improve Returns .In order to provide value to our customers and to fund growth opportunities that we are targeting, we must operate efficiently and effectively. We have a disciplined approach to managing our costs and capital allocation. We require each of our businesses to meet sufficient ROIC levels over appropriate time horizons. Our growth strategies require that we continue to increase our points of presence in order to fully realize the benefits of our multi-channel strategy. Our plans to continue the expansion of our U.S. Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores is expected to increase our presence and allow us to reduce our large-format store footprint.
We also seek to improve store productivity through actions such as expansion of our "Connected Store" model roll-out, increasing our presence in pre-owned and pre-order games and expanding our Pacific Sales store-within-a-store appliances model.
Results of Operations Fiscal 2011 Summary  Net earnings decreased 3.0% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The decrease in net earnings was the result of decreases in both the Domestic and International segments' operating income, driven primarily by the $222million ($147million net of tax) of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, compared to $52million ($25million net of taxes and noncontrolling interest) of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2010. Earnings per diluted share of $3.08 in fiscal 2011 was essentially flat compared to $3.10 in fiscal 2010.
Revenue increased 1.2% to $50.3billion. The increase was driven primarily by the net addition of 147 new stores during fiscal 2011 and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by a comparable store sales decline of 1.8%.
Our gross profit rate increased by 0.6% of revenue to 25.1% of revenue. The increase was driven by an increase in our Domestic segment's gross profit rate primarily due to strong sales of higher-margin smartphones as a result of the continued growth of BestBuy Mobile.
Our SG&A rate increased by 0.6% of revenue to 20.5% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to the deleveraging impact of lower comparable store sales in our Domestic segment, as well as a change in the form of vendor funding. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in incentive compensation in our Domestic segment.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded $222million in restructuring charges related to our plans to exit the Turkey market, restructure the BestBuy branded stores in China and improve efficiencies in our Domestic operations, 36 Table of Contents which resulted in charges for inventory write-downs, property and equipment impairments, employee termination benefits, intangible asset impairments and facility closure costs.
We ended fiscal 2011 with $1.1billion of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $1.8billion at the end of fiscal 2010. Operating cash flow decreased to $1.2billion in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 operating cash flow of $2.2billion due primarily to changes in working capital, while capital expenditures increased 21.0% to $744million.
During fiscal 2011, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.58 per share, or $237million in the aggregate.
We repurchased and retired 32.6million shares at a cost of $1.2billion during fiscal 2011.
Consolidated Results The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions, except per share amounts): Consolidated Performance Summary 2011 (1) 2010 (2) 2009 (3)(4) Revenue $ 50,272 $ 49,694 $ 45,015 Revenue gain % 1.2 % 10.4 % 12.5 % Comparable store sales % (decline) gain (1.8 )% 0.6 % (1.3 )% Gross profit as % of revenue (5) 25.1 % 24.5 % 24.4 % SG&A as % of revenue (5) 20.5 % 19.9 % 20.0 % Operating income $ 2,114 $ 2,235 $ 1,870 Operating income as % of revenue 4.2 % 4.5 % 4.2 % Net earnings $ 1,277 $ 1,317 $ 1,003 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.08 $ 3.10 $ 2.39 (1) Included within our operating income and net earnings for fiscal 2011 is $222million ($147million net of taxes) of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. These charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income of 0.5% of revenue for the fiscal year.
(2) Included within our operating income and net earnings for fiscal 2010 is $52million ($25million net of taxes and noncontrolling interest) of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal first quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. These charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income of 0.1% of revenue for the fiscal year.
(3) Included within our operating income and net earnings for fiscal 2009 is $78million ($48million net of tax) of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. In addition, operating income is inclusive of goodwill and tradename impairment charges of $66million ($64 net of tax) related to our former Speakeasy business. Collectively, these charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income of 0.2% of revenue for the fiscal year.
(4) Included within our net earnings for fiscal 2009 is $111million ($96million net of tax) of investment impairment charges related to our investment in the common stock of CPW.
(5) Because retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of goods sold and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers' corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of goods sold and SG&A, refer to Note1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Fiscal 2011 Results Compared With Fiscal 2010 Throughout fiscal 2011, the majority of geographic markets in which we operate generally continued to endure difficult and uncertain economic conditions. In addition, customer appetite for certain product categories was below industry expectations. Both of these factors had a direct bearing on our revenue. We have responded to the current economic environment by closely managing our SG&A, as well as focusing on efforts to improve our gross profit.
The 1.2% revenue increase in fiscal 2011 resulted primarily from the net addition of 147 new stores during fiscal 2011 and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by a comparable store sales decline.
37 Table of Contents The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2011 were as follows: Net new stores 2.6 % Impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 0.6 % Comparable store sales impact (1.7 )% Non-comparable sales channels (1) (0.2 )% One less week of revenue for BestBuy Europe (2) (0.1 )% Total revenue increase 1.2 % (1) Non-comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non-comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation.
(2) Reflects the incremental revenue associated with BestBuy Europe in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which had 14weeks of activity, compared to 13weeks in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
Our gross profit rate increased 0.6% of revenue in fiscal 2011. Gross profit rate improvements in our Domestic segment accounted for an increase of 0.7% of revenue. The relatively flat gross profit rate in our International segment had no impact on the consolidated gross profit rate. In addition, restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 accounted for a decrease in the gross profit rate of 0.1% of revenue. For further discussion of each segment's gross profit rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary , below.
The 0.6% of revenue SG&A rate increase for fiscal 2011 was due to a 0.7% of revenue increase attributable to the increase in our Domestic segment's SG&A rate, partially offset by a 0.1% of revenue decrease attributable to the decrease in our International segment's SG&A rate. For further discussion of each segment's SG&A rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below.
Our operating income decreased $121million, or 5.4%, and our operating income rate decreased to 4.2% of revenue in fiscal 2011, compared to 4.5% of revenue in fiscal 2010. The 0.3% of revenue operating income rate decrease was driven by an increase in our SG&A rate and increased restructuring charges, partially offset by an increase in our gross profit rate. Our operating income in fiscal 2011 included $222million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared to $52million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2011 restructuring charges include plans to exit the Turkey market, restructure the BestBuy branded stores in China and improve efficiencies in our Domestic segment, which resulted in charges for inventory write-downs, property and equipment impairments, employee termination benefits, intangible asset impairments and facility closure costs. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges related primarily to updating our U.S. BestBuy store operating model, which included eliminating certain positions, as well as employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs in BestBuy Europe.
Fiscal 2010 Results Compared With Fiscal 2009 The 10.4% revenue increase resulted primarily from the acquisition impact of BestBuy Europe in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, which contributed no revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2009 and $2.6billion of revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2010, as well as the net addition of 85 new stores during fiscal 2010.
The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2010 were as follows: Acquisition of BestBuy Europe 5.8 % Net new stores 4.3 % Comparable store sales impact 0.6 % Favorable effect of foreign currency 0.1 % Non-comparable sales channels (1) (0.4 )% Total revenue increase 10.4 % (1) Non-comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non-comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation.
38 Table of Contents The 0.1% of revenue gross profit rate increase for fiscal 2010 was due to a 0.4% of revenue increase from our International segment's gross profit rate, partially offset by a 0.3% of revenue decrease from our Domestic segment's gross profit rate. Of the 0.4% of revenue increase from our International segment, the impact of the acquisition of BestBuy Europe, which carries a normally higher gross profit rate and contributed no gross profit in the first six months of fiscal 2009 compared to a full year of gross profit in fiscal 2010, increased our fiscal 2010 gross profit rate by 0.3% of revenue. For further discussion of each segment's gross profit rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below.
The 0.1% of revenue SG&A rate decrease for fiscal 2010 was due to a 0.4% of revenue decrease from our Domestic segment's SG&A rate, partially offset by a 0.3% of revenue increase from our International segment's SG&A rate. Included within the 0.3% of revenue increase from our International segment is the impact of the acquisition of BestBuy Europe, which increased our fiscal 2010 SG&A rate by 0.6% of revenue. For further discussion of each segment's SG&A rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below.
Our operating income in fiscal 2010 also included $52million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal first quarter, compared to $78million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2009. The 2010 restructuring charge related primarily to updating our U.S. BestBuy store operating model, which included eliminating certain positions, as well as employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs in BestBuy Europe, whereas the fiscal 2009 restructuring charges related primarily to employee termination benefits offered pursuant to voluntary and involuntary separation plans at our corporate headquarters and certain other locations.
39 Table of Contents Segment Performance Summary Domestic The following table presents selected financial data for our Domestic segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): Domestic Segment Performance Summary 2011 (1) 2010 (2) 2009 (3) Revenue $ 37,186 $ 37,314 $ 35,070 Revenue (decline) gain % (0.3 )% 6.4 % 5.2 % Comparable store sales % (decline) gain (3.0 )% 1.7 % (1.3 )% Gross profit as % of revenue 25.1 % 24.2 % 24.6 % SG&A as % of revenue 19.6 % 18.6 % 19.2 % Operating income $ 2,031 $ 2,071 $ 1,758 Operating income as % of revenue 5.5 % 5.6 % 5.0 % (1) Included within our Domestic segment's operating income for fiscal 2011 is $51million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to increase our efficiency. These charges resulted in a decrease in our Domestic segment's operating income of 0.1% of revenue for the fiscal year.
(2) Included within our Domestic segment's operating income for fiscal 2010 is $25million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal first quarter related to measures we took to update our U.S. BestBuy store operating model. These charges resulted in a decrease in our Domestic segment's operating income of less than 0.1% of revenue for the fiscal year.
(3) Included within our Domestic segment's operating income for fiscal 2009 is $72million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses. In addition, operating income is inclusive of goodwill and tradename impairment charges of $66million related to our former Speakeasy business. Collectively, these charges resulted in a decrease in our Domestic segment's operating income of 0.4% of revenue for the fiscal year.
The following table reconciles our Domestic segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years: Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2011 Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year BestBuy 1,023 46  1,069 31 (1 ) 1,099 BestBuy Mobile 38 36  74 103  177 Pacific Sales 34 1  35   35 Magnolia Audio Video 6   6   6 Geek Squad 6   6  (6 )  Total Domestic segment stores 1,107 83  1,190 134 (7 ) 1,317 Fiscal 2011 Results Compared With Fiscal 2010 Our Domestic segment's gross profit improved in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, with a continued rate improvement partially offset by a revenue decline. These factors, combined with an increase in SG&A and restructuring charges, led to a modest decline in operating income.
We believe the revenue decline resulted primarily from a combination of weakness in several key consumer electronics industry product categories and a decline in our estimated domestic market share. Consumers continue to be highly selective and cautious about how and when they make consumer electronics purchases. As a specialty retailer in the consumer electronics industry, the adoption of new technology and the timing of product life-cycles continue to play an important role in revenue trends. For example, the demand for new television technologies did not materialize as the industry anticipated. Similarly, we saw a shift in consumer demand within mobile computing, as increased sales of tablets resulted in a lower overall sales mix of notebook computers throughout fiscal 2011.
40 Table of Contents The 0.3% revenue decline in fiscal 2011 was due primarily to a comparable store sales decline of 3.0%, partially offset by the impact of net new stores opened during fiscal 2011. The components of the net revenue decrease in the Domestic segment in fiscal 2011 were as follows: Comparable store sales impact (2.9 )% Non-comparable sales channels (1) (0.1 )% Net new stores 2.7 % Total revenue decrease (0.3 )% (1) Non-comparable sales channels reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation.
The following table presents the Domestic segment's revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2011 and 2010: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended February26, 2011 February27, 2010 February26, 2011 February27, 2010 Consumer electronics 37 % 39 % (6.3 )% 1.1 % Home office 37 % 34 % 3.6 % 12.8 % Entertainment 14 % 16 % (13.3 )% (13.2 )% Appliances 5 % 4 % 7.0 % (4.2 )% Services 6 % 6 % 0.5 % (1.1 )% Other 1 % 1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % (3.0 )% 1.7 % The products having the largest impact on our comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2011 were entertainment hardware and software (which includes video gaming hardware and software, CDs and DVDs) and televisions. Comparable store sales gains in mobile phones, mobile computing (consisting of notebook computers, netbooks and tablets) partially offset these declines. Revenue from our Domestic segment's online operations increased 13% in fiscal 2011 and is incorporated in the table above.
The 6.3% comparable store sales decline in the consumer electronics revenue category was driven primarily by a decrease in the sales of televisions and cameras and camcorders, partially offset by strong sales from our expanded assortment of e-Readers. The 3.6% comparable store sales gain in the home office revenue category was primarily the result of increased sales of mobile phones due to the continued growth of BestBuy Mobile, as well as gains in the sales of mobile computing. The 13.3% comparable store sales decline in the entertainment revenue category was mainly the result of declining sales in video gaming hardware and software, partially caused by industry-wide softness combined with a decline in our market share, as well as the continued decline in the sales of DVDs and CDs as consumers shift to digital content. The 7.0% comparable store sales gain in the appliances revenue category was due to an increase in unit sales with relatively flat average selling prices, with particular strength in kitchen and small appliances. The 0.5% comparable store sales gain in the services revenue category was due primarily to a gain in the sales of computer services, partially offset by a decline in the sales of repair and home theater installation services, due in part to the decrease in television sales noted above.
Despite a modest decline in revenue, our Domestic segment experienced gross profit growth in fiscal 2011 of $324million, or 3.6%, compared to fiscal 2010, due to rate improvements. The 0.9% of revenue increase in the gross profit rate was due to favorable rate and mix impacts of 0.7% of revenue and 0.2% of revenue, respectively, and resulted primarily from the following factors collectively:  increased sales of higher-margin mobile phones as a result of the growth in BestBuy Mobile; 41 Table of Contents  a change in the form of vendor funding for fiscal 2011, shifting more dollars to gross profit than SG&A; and  improved attachment of services, particularly in the mobile computing product category;  partially offset by declining average selling prices of televisions.
Our Domestic segment's SG&A grew $348million, or 5.0%, in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in SG&A was driven by the opening of new stores and an increase in the BestBuy Mobile profit share-based management fee, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. The following factors collectively contributed to the Domestic segment's SG&A rate increase of 1.0% of revenue:  deleverage due to the comparable store sales decline;  continued growth in BestBuy Mobile (including the profit share-based management fee we paid to BestBuy Europe, which is offset in the International segment SG&A results and, therefore, has no net impact on our consolidated operating income); and  the change in the form of vendor funding as discussed above;  partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs.
The $40million decrease in our Domestic segment's operating income for fiscal 2011 was due to an increase in restructuring charges, a modest decline in revenue, and higher SG&A spending, partially offset by increased gross profit due to an improvement in the gross profit rate. Our Domestic segment's operating income in fiscal 2011 included $51million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared to $25million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2011 restructuring charges resulted from activities to improve efficiencies in our Domestic segment, which resulted in charges for inventory write-downs, property and equipment impairments, employee termination benefits and intangible asset impairments. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges related primarily to updating our U.S. BestBuy store operating model, which resulted in the elimination of certain positions for which we incurred employee termination costs.
Fiscal 2010 Results Compared With Fiscal 2009 The 6.4% revenue increase in fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from the net addition of 85 new stores during fiscal 2010 and a comparable store sales gain of 1.7%.
The components of the net revenue increase in the Domestic segment in fiscal 2010 were as follows: Net new stores 4.7 % Comparable store sales impact 1.7 % Total revenue increase 6.4 % 42 Table of Contents The following table presents the Domestic segment's revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2010 and 2009: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended February27, 2010 February28, 2009 February27, 2010 February28, 2009 Consumer electronics 39 % 39 % 1.1 % (5.8 )% Home office 34 % 31 % 12.8 % 10.4 % Entertainment 16 % 19 % (13.2 )% (5.9 )% Appliances 4 % 5 % (4.2 )% (15.4 )% Services 6 % 6 % (1.1 )% 4.1 % Other 1 % <1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % 1.7 % (1.3 )% Our Domestic segment's comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2010 improved sequentially each quarter of the fiscal year due primarily to an increase in average ticket and reflected our market share gains. The products having the largest effect on our Domestic segment's comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2010 were notebook computers, flat-panel televisions and mobile phones. Stronger sales in these product categories were partially offset by comparable store sales declines in our entertainment revenue category. Revenue from our Domestic segment's online operations increased 22% in fiscal 2010 and is incorporated in the table above.
The 1.1% comparable store sales gain in the consumer electronics revenue category was driven primarily by increases in the sales of flat-panel televisions as unit sales increases more than offset average selling price decreases, partially offset by declines in the sales of navigation products and MP3 players. The 12.8% comparable store sales gain in the home office revenue category was primarily the result of continued growth in the sales of notebook computers, which benefited from the launch of a new operating system, as well as mobile phones, which included a full year of our BestBuy Mobile store-within-a-store experience in all U.S. BestBuy stores, partially offset by declines in the sales of computer monitors. The 13.2% comparable store sales decline in the entertainment revenue category was due principally to a decline in sales of video gaming, partially caused by industry-wide softness and a maturing product platform, as well as a continued decline in sales of DVDs and CDs. The 4.2% comparable store sales decline in the appliances revenue category was due to a decrease in unit sales which more than offset increases in average selling prices. The 1.1% comparable store sales decline in the services revenue category was due primarily to a decline in home theater installation, partially offset by modest increases in our sales of extended warranties.
Our Domestic segment experienced gross profit growth of $407million in fiscal 2010, or 4.7% compared to fiscal 2009, due to increased revenue volumes. The 0.4% of revenue decrease in the gross profit rate was due primarily to a change in revenue mix, which reduced the gross profit rate by 0.5% of revenue and resulted from a continued shift in the revenue mix to sales of lower-margin notebook computers, partially offset by additional mix shift into higher-margin mobile phones. In addition, improved margin rate performance provided a 0.1% of revenue increase to the gross profit rate.
Despite revenue growth of 6.4%, our Domestic segment's SG&A grew only 3.1% or by $207million. Continued store openings and significant year over year performance improvements drove higher SG&A spend in fiscal 2010 for incentive pay, payroll and benefits and rent, partially offset by lower SG&A spend in various discretionary categories such as information technology and supply chain project expenditures, store reset and transformation costs, advertising and travel. The 0.6% of revenue SG&A rate decline was primarily due to the reductions in discretionary categories discussed above, which collectively reduced the SG&A rate by 1.0% of revenue. The overall leveraging impact of higher comparable store sales on payroll and benefits further reduced the SG&A rate by 0.2% of revenue. However, we had higher incentive pay expense due to improvements in performance in fiscal 2010 and no incentive pay expense in the prior year, which collectively offset the SG&A rate improvement by 0.6% of revenue.
43 Table of Contents The increase in our Domestic segment's operating income for fiscal 2010 was due to higher gross profit dollars from net new store openings and comparable store sales growth, while SG&A dollars grew only 3.1% despite revenue growth of 6.4%, as shown by the decrease in the SG&A rate of 0.6% of revenue. A decrease in restructuring and no goodwill and tradename impairment charges further contributed to the additional operating income.
Our Domestic segment's operating income in fiscal 2010 included $25million of restructuring charges recorded in the first fiscal quarter, compared to $72million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges were primarily the result of updates to our Domestic segment's BestBuy branded store operating model, which resulted in the elimination of certain positions for which we incurred employee termination costs, whereas the fiscal 2009 restructuring charges related primarily to employee termination benefits offered pursuant to voluntary and involuntary separation plans at our principal corporate headquarters and certain other locations.

These charges resulted in a decrease in our International segment's operating income of 1.3% of revenue for the fiscal year.
(2) Included within our International segment's operating income in fiscal 2010 is $27million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal first quarter, primarily related to employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs in BestBuy Europe. These charges resulted in a decrease in our International segment's operating income of 0.2% of revenue for the fiscal year.
(3) Included within our International segment's operating income in fiscal 2009 is $6million of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our Canada business. The charges represent termination benefits in our Canada business. These charges resulted in a decrease in our International segment's operating income of 0.1% of revenue for the fiscal year.

Fiscal 2011 Results Compared With Fiscal 2010 While challenging economic conditions persisted in fiscal 2011 in many of the countries in which we operate, our International segment continued to grow revenue and experienced a comparable store sales gain for the year. A decline in operating income was due principally to the impact of the restructuring activities in fiscal 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the International segment experienced gross profit improvements with only a modest increase in SG&A. Continued growth in consumer spending and temporary government stimulus programs contributed to stronger sales and improved operating income in our China operations, particularly in our Five Star business. Our Canada operations faced many of the same market conditions and factors affecting the U.S. consumer electronics industry, with the adoption of new technology and the timing of product life-cycles continuing to play an important role in revenue trends. Similarly, our Europe operations saw the impacts from a constrained economy, but continued to benefit from higher Best Buy Mobile profit share-based management fees paid in fiscal 2011.
The 5.7% increase in revenue for fiscal 2011 was due to the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (mainly related to the Canadian dollar), the impact of net new stores opened during fiscal 2011, and a 2.4% comparable store sales gain, partially offset by the impact of having one less week of revenue in Europe and a decline in sales in non-comparable sales channels. The increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2011 was the result of gains in China and Europe, partially offset by a decline in Canada.
45 Table of Contents The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2011 were as follows: Impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 2.4 % Net new stores 2.3 % Comparable store sales impact 2.0 % One less week of revenue for BestBuy Europe (1) (0.6 )% Non-comparable sales channels (2) (0.4 )% Total revenue increase 5.7 % (1) Reflects the incremental revenue associated with BestBuy Europe in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which had 14weeks of activity, compared to 13weeks in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
(2) Non-comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non-comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation.
The following table presents the International segment's revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2011 and 2010: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended Year Ended February26, 2011 February27, 2010 February26, 2011 February27, 2010 Consumer electronics 21 % 20 % (2.5 )% (12.0 )% Home office 55 % 53 % 5.0 % (0.8 )% Entertainment 6 % 7 % (12.4 )% (12.4 )% Appliances 9 % 8 % 15.2 % 7.3 % Services 9 % 12 % (1.6 )% 6.2 % Other <1 % <1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % 2.4 % (3.7 )% The products having the largest impact on our International segment's comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2011 were mobile phones, appliances and mobile computing. Increased sales in these product categories were partially offset by declines in the sales of entertainment hardware and software, including video gaming hardware and software, DVDs and CDs.
The 2.5% comparable store sales decline in the consumer electronics revenue category resulted primarily from declines in the sales of navigation products and MP3 players and accessories. Televisions remained essentially flat, as gains in the sales of televisions in China, were offset by declines in Canada, which faced market conditions similar to the U.S. The 5.0% comparable store sales gain in the home office revenue category resulted primarily from gains in the sales of mobile phones and mobile computing, partially offset by declines in sales of desktop computers, monitors and accessories. The 12.4% comparable store sales decline in the entertainment revenue category reflected a decrease in the sales of video gaming hardware and software and continued decreases in sales of DVDs and CDs. The 15.2% comparable store sales gain in the appliances revenue category resulted primarily from increases in the sales of appliances within our Five Star operations, where growth in consumer spending and temporary government stimulus programs continued to contribute to stronger sales. The 1.6% comparable store sales decline in the services revenue category was due primarily to a decrease in the sales of extended warranties driven by declines in the sales of televisions and notebook computers in Canada.
Our International segment experienced gross profit growth in fiscal 2011 of $153million, or 4.9%. The increase in gross profit in fiscal 2011 was due to an increase in revenue and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as the gross profit rate decreased slightly. The 0.2% of revenue decrease in the gross profit rate in fiscal 2011 reflects an unfavorable mix impact of 0.5% of revenue, partially offset by a favorable rate impact of 0.3% of revenue. The unfavorable mix impact resulted primarily from growth in our lower-margin China business and a decrease in the mix of our higher-margin Europe business. The favorable rate impact was mainly the result of gains in Canada, with improved 46 Table of Contents margins in all product categories, especially mobile computing and entertainment hardware and software. In addition, restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 had an unfavorable impact of 0.1% of revenue.
In fiscal 2011, our International segment's SG&A increased $104million, or 3.5%, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased spending associated with new store openings across the segment, partially offset by a decrease in Europe due to the higher BestBuy Mobile profit share-based management fee. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, our International segment's SG&A increased $35million. The 0.5% of revenue improvement in the SG&A rate was driven primarily by a rate decline in Europe due to the higher BestBuy Mobile profit share-based management fee and the favorable mix impact from both growth in our lower-rate China business and a decrease in the sales mix of our higher-rate Europe business. These improvements were partially offset by a rate increase in Canada caused by the deleveraging impact of its comparable store sales decline and increased advertising costs to drive traffic.
The decrease in our International segment's operating income in fiscal 2011 resulted primarily from higher restructuring charges and costs associated with the operation of new large-format stores in Europe, China, Mexico and Turkey, partially offset by higher operating income in Europe and from Five Star. Our International segment's operating income in fiscal 2011 included $171million of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter, compared to $27million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2011 restructuring charges primarily related to inventory write-downs, property and equipment impairments, employee termination benefits and facility closure costs as a result of our plans to exit the Turkey market and restructure the BestBuy branded stores in China. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges were related primarily to employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs at BestBuy Europe.
Fiscal 2010 Results Compared With Fiscal 2009 The 24.5% increase in revenue for fiscal 2010 was due to the inclusion of BestBuy Europe, which contributed no revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2009 and $2.6billion of revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2010, and the impact of net new stores opened during fiscal 2010, partially offset by the comparable store sales decline of 3.7% and decreases in our non-comparable sales channels. The decrease in comparable store sales was the result of a comparable store sales decline in Canada, partially offset by comparable store sales gains in Europe and China. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on revenue for fiscal 2010.
The components of the net revenue increase in fiscal 2010 were as follows: Acquisition of BestBuy Europe 25.8 % Net new stores 3.5 % Impact of foreign currency 0.4 % Comparable store sales impact (3.3 )% Non-comparable sales channels (1) (1.9 )% Total revenue increase 24.5 % (1) Non-comparable sales channels primarily reflects the impact from revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as well as other non-comparable sales channels not included within our comparable store sales calculation.
47 Table of Contents The following table presents the International segment's revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2010 and 2009: Revenue Mix Summary Comparable Store Sales Summary Year Ended (1) Year Ended (2) February27, 2010 February28, 2009 February27, 2010 February28, 2009 Consumer electronics 20 % 26 % (12.0 )% (0.9 )% Home office 53 % 45 % (0.8 )% (2.7 )% Entertainment 7 % 9 % (12.4 )% 3.3 % Appliances 8 % 10 % 7.3 % (2.2 )% Services 12 % 10 % 6.2 % 3.1 % Other <1 % <1 % n/a n/a Total 100 % 100 % (3.7 )% (0.9 )% (1) The International segment's revenue mix changed beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 due to our acquisition of BestBuy Europe, whose business primarily relates to the sale of mobile phones and voice and data service plans, which are included in our home office revenue category. In addition, BestBuy Europe offers mobile phone insurance and other mobile and fixed-line telecommunication services, which are included in our services revenue category. As a result, the International segment's home office and services revenue categories grew in fiscal 2010, resulting in a lower mix percentage for the segment's consumer electronics, entertainment and appliances revenue categories.
(2) The comparable store sales figures for the fiscal year ended February27, 2010, included six months of BestBuy Europe's comparable store sales. However, comparable store sales for the fiscal year ended February28, 2009, did not include BestBuy Europe as the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was the first period in which BestBuy Europe was included in our comparable store sales calculation.
The products having the largest impact on our International segment's comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2010 were flat-panel televisions, video gaming and digital cameras and camcorders. Weaker sales of these products were partially offset by comparable store sales gains in appliances, notebook computers and services. Our International segment's comparable store sales improved sequentially each quarter of fiscal 2010 amidst improving global economic conditions and temporary government stimulus programs in China.
The 12.0% comparable store sales decline in the consumer electronics revenue category resulted primarily from declines in the sales of flat-panel televisions, digital cameras and camcorders, and navigation products. The 0.8% comparable store sales decline in the home office revenue category resulted primarily from comparable store sales declines in computer monitors and accessories, partially offset by gains in the sales of notebook computers and mobile phones. The 12.4% comparable store sales decline in the entertainment revenue category reflected a decrease in the sales of video gaming hardware and software and continued decreases in sales of DVDs and CDs. The 7.3% comparable store sales gain in the appliances revenue category resulted from increases in the sales of major appliances and small electrics, notably within our Canada and China operations where promotions and temporary government stimulus programs in China helped to fuel stronger sales. The 6.2% comparable store sales gain in the services revenue category was due primarily to an increase in revenue from our product repair business.
Our International segment experienced gross profit growth of $755million in fiscal 2010, or 31.7%, driven predominantly by the acquisition of BestBuy Europe. The acquisition impact of BestBuy Europe of 1.4% of revenue was the principal driver behind the International segment's 1.4% of revenue gross profit rate increase for fiscal 2010, with an additional 0.2% of revenue increase from gross profit rate improvements in Europe due primarily to negotiation of more favorable vendor terms across the European business in the second half of fiscal 2010. An increase in Canada's gross profit rate also contributed a 0.1% of revenue increase. Offsetting these increases to the International segment's gross profit rate was a 0.3% of revenue decrease from China due primarily to heavier promotions and clearances.
48 Table of Contents Our International segment's SG&A grew 30.2%, or an increase of $682million. In the first six months of fiscal 2010, Europe's SG&A spend was $775million with no comparable expenses in the same period one year ago. Europe's lower SG&A in the last six months of fiscal 2010 compared to the same period one year ago partially offset the first-half year over year increase. New store start-up costs in Mexico and Turkey also increased SG&A, while SG&A spend in Canada and China remained relatively flat in fiscal 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year.
The acquisition impact of BestBuy Europe of 1.7% of revenue was the principal driver behind the International segment's 1.1% of revenue SG&A rate increase for fiscal 2010. In addition, the deleveraging impact of the comparable store sales decline on payroll, benefits and overhead costs in Canada contributed a 0.2% of revenue increase. Start-up costs, rent expense and incremental staffing for new store openings in Mexico and Turkey further contributed a 0.3% of revenue increase to the International segment's SG&A rate. Offsetting these increases in the SG&A rate was a 0.8% of revenue decrease in Europe in the second half of fiscal 2010, due in part to lower payroll costs stemming from their restructuring in the fiscal first quarter, as well as a 0.3% of revenue decrease in China, caused primarily by cost-cutting measures to reduce overhead, payroll and marketing expenses.
The increase in our International segment's operating income resulted primarily from higher operating income in Europe and China, partially offset by increased new store investments in Mexico and Turkey, $27million of restructuring charges and slightly lower operating income in Canada.
Our International segment's operating income in fiscal 2010 included $27million of restructuring charges recorded in the first fiscal quarter, compared to $6million of restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2010 restructuring charges were related primarily to employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs at BestBuy Europe, whereas the fiscal 2009 restructuring charges were employee termination benefits in our Canada business.
Additional Consolidated Results Other Income (Expense) Our investment income and other in fiscal 2011 was $51million, compared to $54 and $35million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The relatively flat investment income in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was principally the result of lower returns on our deferred compensation assets, partially offset by the gain on the sale of our former Speakeasy business in fiscal 2011. The increase in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the gains we recorded in fiscal 2010 on our deferred compensation assets, which experienced better returns when compared to the prior year. Gains on these assets have no impact on our net earnings, as they are offset by expense recorded within SG&A. Partially offsetting the increase was the impact of lower interest rates earned on our cash and investment balances in fiscal 2010.
Interest expense in fiscal 2011 was $87million, compared to $94million in both fiscal 2010 and 2009. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2011, compared to fiscal 2010, was the result of lower average short-term borrowings throughout fiscal 2011, partially offset by higher average interest rates on outstanding short-term borrowings. The relatively flat interest expense from fiscal 2009 to 2010 was the result of lower average short-term borrowings during the year, which was fully offset by a full year of higher interest-bearing long-term debt.
Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate ("ETR") was 34.4% in fiscal 2011, compared to 36.5% in fiscal 2010 and 39.6% in fiscal 2009. The decrease in the ETR in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due primarily to the impact of increased tax benefits from foreign operations, tax benefits resulting from the sale of our former Speakeasy business and the favorable resolution of certain non-recurring items. Excluding the impact of various fiscal 2011 non-recurring items, the ETR would have been approximately 36.5%.
The decrease in the ETR in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due principally to the fiscal 2009 impacts of the other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in the common stock of CPW and the non-deductibility of our $62million goodwill impairment charge, as well as the favorable net impact of certain discrete foreign tax matters in the 49 Table of Contents third quarter of fiscal 2010. Excluding the impact of the fiscal 2010 discrete foreign tax matters, the fiscal 2010 ETR would have been 38.3%. Additionally, excluding the impact of the fiscal 2009 impairment charges, the fiscal 2009 ETR would have been 36.8%.
Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests The increase in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due to the higher net earnings of BestBuy Europe, in which Carphone Warehouse Group plc has a 50% noncontrolling interest. The increase in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due to having a full year of earnings from BestBuy Europe in fiscal 2010, as we did not acquire BestBuy Europe until the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices Highly competitive market conditions and the general economic environment minimized inflation's impact on the selling prices of our products and services, and on our expenses. In addition, price deflation and the continued commoditization of key technology products limited our ability to increase our gross profit rate.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary We continue to closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. The key variables we use to manage liquidity requirements and investments to support our growth strategies include discretionary SG&A spending, capital expenditures, credit facilities and short-term borrowing arrangements, working capital and our share repurchase program.
Capital expenditures, particularly with respect to opening new stores and remodeling existing stores, is a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment. In both fiscal 2011 and 2010, we moderated our capital spending in response to the challenging economic environment relative to our recent historical trend.
We ended fiscal 2011 with $1.1billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, compared to $1.9billion at the end of fiscal 2010. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to the $1.2billion of cash utilized in fiscal 2011 to repurchase shares of our common stock, as well as decreased cash generated from operations in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, was $1.8billion at the end of fiscal 2011, an increase from $1.6billion at the end of fiscal 2010. Operating cash flow decreased 46.1% to $1.2billion in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, while capital expenditures increased 21.0% to $744million.
Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,190 $ 2,206 $ 1,877 Investing activities (569 ) (540 ) (3,427 ) Financing activities (1,357 ) (348 ) 591 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 13 10 19 (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (723 ) $ 1,328 $ (940 ) 50 Table of Contents Operating Activities The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due primarily to an increase in cash used for accounts payable, as well as a decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable. The increase in cash used for accounts payable was due primarily to the timing and level of inventory receipts compared to vendor payments as we approached fiscal 2011 year-end. As we reduced inventory receipts in January and February 2011 in response to lower holiday sales trends, our total accounts payable declined. Cash used for inventory was also lower in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 because the fiscal 2011 year-over-year increase in inventory was lower than in the prior year due to focused efforts to manage inventory levels in light of comparable store sales declines. The decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable was due primarily to the timing of several large payments due from our vendors at the end of fiscal 2011. Other fluctuations in cash from operating activities were due primarily to higher incentive compensation payments in fiscal 2011 (relating to our fiscal 2010 performance) and other miscellaneous timing differences.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to increases in cash provided by net earnings, accounts receivable, other liabilities and accrued income taxes, partially offset by an increase in cash used for merchandise inventories. The increase in cash provided by accounts receivable was due primarily to the timing of receipt of customer and network carrier receivables in our Europe business, as well as network carrier receivables associated with BestBuy Mobile in the U.S. The increases in cash provided by other liabilities were due primarily to the timing and magnitude of transaction taxes payable in various jurisdictions, as well as accrued bonuses. Finally, the increase in cash provided by accrued income taxes was due to the timing and magnitude of tax accruals as a result of higher net earnings. These changes were largely offset by the increase in cash used for merchandise inventories due to increased inventory levels in fiscal 2010, notably in notebook computers and flat-panel televisions, as a result of increased consumer demand and a strengthening economy, compared to fiscal 2009 when we tightened inventory levels amidst a weaker economy and lower holiday sales.
Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was relatively flat in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, as an increase in cash used for capital expenditures was offset by an increase in cash provided by the sale of a portion of our auction rate securities ("ARS") during fiscal 2011. See Auction Rate Securities and Restricted Cash and Capital Expenditures below for additional information.
The decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the $2.2billion of net cash associated with the acquisition of businesses in fiscal 2009, largely BestBuy Europe. Also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in capital expenditures to $615million in fiscal 2010, compared to $1.3billion in fiscal 2009.
Financing Activities The increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of $1.2billion of cash we used to repurchase our common stock in fiscal 2011. We had no repurchases in fiscal 2010.
The change in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2010, compared to cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2009, was primarily the result of a $1.1billion decrease in borrowings, net of repayments, compared to the prior year. Larger borrowings in the prior year were associated with the acquisition of BestBuy Europe and normal working capital needs. In addition, our increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2010 allowed us to reduce our short-term borrowings.
Sources of Liquidity Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations and to finance anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives in fiscal 2012. However, in the event our liquidity is 51 Table of Contents insufficient, we may be required to limit our future expansion plans or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.
We have a $2.3billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, as amended (the "Credit Facility"), with a syndicate of banks, with no borrowings outstanding at February26, 2011. The Credit Facility expires in September 2012. At April20, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.
We have $813million available under secured and unsecured revolving credit facilities related to our International segment operations, of which $557million was outstanding at February26, 2011.
We previously had a revolving credit line with UBS AG and its affiliates (collectively, "UBS") secured by the par value of our UBS-brokered ARS. However, pursuant to the settlement described in Note3, Investments , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K, the revolving credit line expired by its terms during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 when UBS bought back all of our UBS-brokered ARS.
Our ability to access our credit facilities is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of our facilities, including financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. At February26, 2011, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. If an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt, it would likely constitute an event of default under our credit facilities as well.
An interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre-tax earnings before fixed charges (interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense) to fixed charges. Our interest coverage ratio, calculated as reported in Exhibit No.12.1 of this Annual Report on Form10-K, was 5.78 and 6.08 in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Our credit ratings and outlooks at April20, 2011, are summarized below and are consistent with the ratings and outlooks reported in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the fiscal year ended February27, 2010.
Rating Agency Rating Outlook Fitch Ratings Ltd.
BBB+ Negative Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
Baa2 Stable Standard& Poor's Ratings Services BBB- Stable Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. We are not aware of any current circumstances which could cause our credit ratings to be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new-store occupancy costs. In addition, the conversion rights of the holders of our convertible debentures could be accelerated if our credit ratings were to be downgraded.
Auction Rate Securities and Restricted Cash At February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, we had $110million and $280million, respectively, invested in ARS recorded at fair value within short-term investments and equity and other investments (long-term) in our consolidated balance sheets. The majority of our ARS portfolio is AAA/Aaa-rated and collateralized by student loans, which are guaranteed 95% to 100% by the U.S. government. Due to the auction failures that began in mid-February 2008, we have been unable to liquidate some of our ARS. The investment principal associated with our ARS subject to failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions occur, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuers establish a different form of financing to replace these securities, or final payments are due according to the contractual maturities of the debt issues, which range from five to 32years. We intend to hold our ARS until we can recover the full principal amount through one of the means described above, and have the ability to do so based on our other sources of liquidity.
52 Table of Contents Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for vendor payables, general liability insurance, workers' compensation insurance and customer warranty and insurance programs. Restricted cash and cash equivalents, which are included in other current assets, were $488million and $482million at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, respectively.
Capital Expenditures A component of our long-term strategy is our capital expenditure program. This program includes, among other things, investments in new stores, store remodeling, store relocations and expansions, new distribution facilities and information technology enhancements. During fiscal 2011, we invested $744million in property and equipment, including opening 147 new stores, expanding and remodeling certain stores, and upgrading our information technology systems and capabilities. The 21.0% increase in our capital expenditures compared to the prior fiscal year was due primarily to increased spending on information technology and additional store-related projects.
The following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 New stores $ 193 $ 229 $ 387 Store-related projects (1) 208 90 333 Information technology 327 275 494 Other 16 21 89 Total capital expenditures (2) $ 744 $ 615 $ 1,303 (1) Includes store remodels and expansions, as well as various merchandising projects.
(2) Total capital expenditures exclude non-cash capital expenditures of $81, $9 and $42 for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Non-cash capital expenditures are comprised of capitalized leases of $52, $9 and $35, as well as additions to property and equipment included in accounts payable of $29, $0 and $7, respectively, for each fiscal year.
Refer to Note13, Contingencies and Commitments , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K for further information regarding our significant commitments for capital expenditures at February26, 2011.
Debt and Capital 2013 Notes In June 2008, we sold $500million principal amount of notes due July15, 2013 (the "2013 Notes"). The 2013 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% per year, payable semi-annually on January15 and July15 of each year, beginning January15, 2009. The interest payable on the 2013 Notes is subject to adjustment if either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard& Poor's Ratings Services downgrades the rating assigned to the 2013 Notes to below investment grade. Net proceeds from the sale of the 2013 Notes were $496million, after an initial issuance discount of approximately $1million and other transaction costs.
We may redeem some or all of the 2013 Notes at any time, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2013 Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and an applicable make-whole amount as described in the indenture relating to the 2013 Notes.
The 2013 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The 2013 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our North American subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens, enter into sale and lease-back transactions and, in the case of such subsidiaries, incur debt.
53 Table of Contents Convertible Debentures In January 2002, we sold convertible subordinated debentures having an aggregate principal amount of $402million. The proceeds from the offering, net of $6million in offering expenses, were $396million. On January15, 2007, the debentures became callable at par, at our option, for cash. The debentures mature in 2022.
Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the debentures on January15, 2012, and again on January15, 2017, if not previously redeemed, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. We have the option to settle the purchase price in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. Since holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the debentures on January15, 2012, we classified the debentures in the current portion of long-term debt at February26, 2011.
The debentures become convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 21.7391shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $46.00 per share, if the closing price of our common stock exceeds a specified price for 20 consecutive trading days in a 30-trading day period preceding the date of conversion, if our credit rating falls below specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur. The debentures were not convertible at February26, 2011, and have not been convertible through April20, 2011.
The debentures have an interest rate of 2.25% per annum. The interest rate may be reset, but not below 2.25% or above 3.25%, on July15, 2011, and July15, 2016. One of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the debentures.
2016 Notes and 2021 Notes Subsequent to fiscal 2011, we sold $350million principal amount of notes due March15, 2016 (the "2016 Notes") and $650million principal amount of notes due March15, 2021 (the "2021 Notes", and together with the 2016 Notes, the "Notes"). The 2016 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.75% per year, while the 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on March15 and September15 of each year, beginning September15, 2011. The Notes were issued at a slight discount to par, which when coupled with underwriting discounts of $6million, resulted in net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of $990million.
We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed and (ii)the sum of the present values of each remaining scheduled payment of principal and interest on the Notes redeemed discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Notes to the redemption date as described in the indenture (including the supplemental indenture) relating to the Notes. Furthermore, if a change of control triggering event occurs, unless we have previously exercised our option to redeem the Notes, we will be required to offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date.
The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our North American subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens or to enter into sale and lease-back transactions.
Other At the end of fiscal 2011, we had $170million outstanding under financing lease obligations.
Share Repurchases and Dividends From time to time, we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our Board. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons, such as acquiring shares to offset dilution related to equity-based incentives, including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, and optimizing our capital structure.
54 Table of Contents In June 2007, our Board authorized up to $5.5billion in share repurchases. The program, which became effective on June26, 2007, terminated and replaced a $1.5billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2006. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the June 2007 program.
We repurchased and retired 32.6million shares at a cost of $1.2billion in fiscal 2011. We made no share repurchases in fiscal 2010 or 2009. At the end of fiscal 2011, $1.3billion of the $5.5billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2007 was available for future share repurchases.
We consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among other things, our cash needs, the availability of funding and the market price of our stock. We expect that cash provided by future operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, will be the sources of funding for our share repurchase program. Based on the anticipated amounts to be generated from those sources of funds in relation to the remaining authorization approved by our Board under the June 2007 share repurchase program, we do not expect that future share repurchases will have a material impact on our short-term or long-term liquidity.
In fiscal 2004, our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 8% to $0.14 per share, and maintained our cash dividend at that rate for the balance of fiscal 2009 and throughout fiscal 2010. We increased our quarterly cash dividend per share by 7% to $0.15 per share effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. During fiscal 2011, we made four cash dividend payments totaling $0.58 per share, or $237million in the aggregate.
Other Financial Measures Our debt to earnings ratio was 1.3 at the end of both fiscal 2011 and 2010. Our adjusted debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent ("EBITDAR") ratio, which includes capitalized operating lease obligations in its calculation, was 2.5 at the end of both fiscal 2011 and 2010, as an increase in operating lease obligations in fiscal 2011 was offset by an increase in the amount of depreciation and amortization (including impairments).
Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the most directly comparable ratio determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). We have included this information in our MD&A as we view the adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness. Furthermore, we believe that our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is important for understanding our financial position and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our long-term debt and other fixed obligations and to fund our future growth. We also believe our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to that of retailers who own, rather than lease, their stores. Our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to own or to lease the location, the owner's desire to own or to lease the location, and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders.
Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is calculated as follows: Adjusted debt to EBITDAR = Adjusted debt EBITDAR 55 Table of Contents The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is our debt to net earnings ratio, which excludes capitalized operating lease obligations from debt in the numerator of the calculation and does not adjust net earnings in the denominator of the calculation.
The following table presents a reconciliation of our debt to net earnings ratio to our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio ($ in millions): 2011 (1) 2010 (1) Debt (including current portion) $ 1,709 $ 1,802 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8 times rental expense) (2) 9,271 9,013 Adjusted debt $ 10,980 $ 10,815 Net earnings including noncontrolling interests (3) $ 1,366 $ 1,394 Interest expense, net 36 40 Income tax expense 714 802 Depreciation and amortization expense (4) 1,145 930 Rental expense 1,159 1,127 EBITDAR $ 4,420 $ 4,293 Debt to net earnings ratio 1.3 1.3 Adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio 2.5 2.5 (1) Debt is reflected as of the balance sheet dates for each of the respective fiscal year-ends, while rental expense and the other components of EBITDAR represent activity for the 12months ended as of each of the respective balance sheet dates.
(2) The multiple of eight times annual rental expense in the calculation of our capitalized operating lease obligations is the multiple used for the retail sector by one of the nationally recognized credit rating agencies that rate our creditworthiness, and we consider it to be an appropriate multiple for our lease portfolio.
(3) We utilize net earnings including noncontrolling interests within our calculation as such net earnings and related cash flows attributable to noncontrolling interests are available to service our debt and operating lease commitments.
(4) Depreciation and amortization expense includes impairments of fixed assets, investments, goodwill and intangible assets (including impairments associated with our fiscal 2011 restructuring).
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other than operating leases, we do not have any off-balance-sheet financing. A summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the "Contractual Obligations" table below. Additional information regarding our operating leases is available in Item2, Properties , and Note9, Leases , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
56 Table of Contents The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations by fiscal year ($ in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Short-term debt obligations $ 557 $ 557 $  $  $  Long-term debt obligations 903 402 500  1 Capital lease obligations 79 14 27 20 18 Financing lease obligations 170 25 47 45 53 Interest payments 686 128 183 127 248 Operating lease obligations (1) 8,247 1,208 2,245 1,864 2,930 Purchase obligations (2) 1,989 1,135 446 393 15 Unrecognized tax benefits (3) 359 Deferred compensation (4) 64 Total $ 13,054 $ 3,469 $ 3,448 $ 2,449 $ 3,265 Note: For additional information refer to Note6, Debt ; Note9, Leases ; Note11, Income Taxes and Note13, Contingencies and Commitments , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
(1) Operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. These charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $2.2billion at February26, 2011.
(2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they are not legally binding agreements, we included open purchase orders in the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30days.
(3) Unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting guidance that we adopted on March4, 2007. As we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table.
(4) Included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at February26, 2011, was a $64million obligation for deferred compensation. As the specific payment dates for the deferred compensation are unknown, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table.
Additionally, we have $2.5billion in undrawn capacity on our credit facilities at February26, 2011, which if drawn upon, would be included as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board.
57 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Inventory We value our inventory at the lower of the cost or market through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss adjustments.
Our inventory valuation reflects markdowns for the excess of the cost over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory. Markdowns establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis.
Our inventory valuation also reflects adjustments for anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g.,theft) that have occurred since the last physical inventory. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure that the inventory reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated.
Our markdown adjustment contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence.
Our inventory loss adjustment contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors, including historical results and current inventory loss trends.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our markdown or inventory loss adjustments during the past three fiscal years.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdowns. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in our actual markdowns at February26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $12million in fiscal 2011.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss adjustment. However, if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in actual physical inventory loss adjustments at February26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $6million in fiscal 2011.
Vendor Allowances We receive funds from vendors for various programs, primarily as reimbursements for costs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and sales incentives.
Vendor allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor's products are included as an expense reduction when the cost is incurred. All other vendor allowances are generally in the form of receipt-based funds or sell-through credits. Receipt-based funds are generally determined based on our level of inventory purchases and initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventories. The deferred amounts are then included as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related product is sold. Sell-through credits are generally based on the number of units we sell over a specified period and are recognized when the related product is sold.
Based on the provisions of our vendor agreements, we develop vendor fund accrual rates by estimating the point at which we will have completed our performance under the agreement and the deferred amounts will be earned. During the year, due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical trends to ensure the deferred amounts earned are appropriately recorded. As a part of these analyses, we apply rates negotiated with our vendors to actual purchase volumes to determine the amount of funds accrued and receivable from the vendor. Certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to record different forms of vendor allowances or vendor receivables during the past three fiscal years.
If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to additional adjustments that could materially, either positively or negatively, impact our gross profit rate and inventory. However, substantially all receivables associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal year and all amounts deferred against inventory turnover within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require subjective long-term estimates. Adjustments to our gross profit rate and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material.
A 10% difference in our vendor receivables at February26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $22million in fiscal 2011.
58 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset.
Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
59 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable.
We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment. Our impairment evaluation involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value.
We carry forward the detailed determination of the fair value of a reporting unit in our annual goodwill impairment analysis if three criteria are met: (1)the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination; (2)the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin; and (3)based on an analysis of events that have occurred since the most recent fair value determination, the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote. For all other reporting units, we perform a detailed determination of fair value of the reporting unit.
Our detailed impairment analysis involves the use of a discounted cash flow model. Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit. Critical assumptions include projected comparable store sales growth, store count, gross profit rates, SG&A rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures and terminal growth rates, as well as an appropriate discount rate. We determine discount rates separately for each reporting unit using the capital asset pricing model. For fiscal 2011, such discount rates ranged from 8.5% to 12.5%. We also use comparable market earnings multiple data and our company's market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations.
These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as our future expectations.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets during the past three fiscal years.
The carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at February26, 2011, were $2.5billion and $105million, respectively.
In fiscal 2011, we identified no goodwill impairments. We determined that the excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units was substantial.
As part of our fiscal 2011 restructuring, we recorded an impairment charge of $10million related to certain indefinite-lived tradenames in our Domestic segment We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.
60 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Tax Contingencies Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions.
Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.
Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
61 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Revenue Recognition See Note1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K, for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies.
We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels.
We record an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for amounts due from third parties that we do not expect to collect. We estimate the allowance based on historical write offs and chargebacks as well as aging trends.
We sell gift cards to customers in our retail stores, through our Web sites and through selected third parties. A liability is initially established for the cash value of the gift card. We recognize revenue from gift cards when: (i)the card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii)the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote ("gift card breakage"). We determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns, which show that after 24months, we can determine the portion of the liability for which redemption is remote.
We have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed at any of our BestBuy branded stores, or through our related Web sites or when using our co-branded credit cards in the U.S. and Canada. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases at BestBuy branded stores and Web sites. The value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the value of points that are projected to be redeemed.
Our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the amount and timing of future sales returns, uncollectible accounts and redemptions of gift cards and certificates. Our estimate of the amount and timing of sales returns, uncollectible accounts and redemptions of gift cards and certificates is based primarily on historical transaction experience.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to measure sales returns or doubtful accounts or to recognize revenue for our gift card and customer loyalty programs during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to measure sales returns and doubtful accounts or to recognize revenue for our gift card and customer loyalty programs. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
A 10% change in our sales return reserve at February26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $1million in fiscal 2011.
A 10% change in our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable at February26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $8million in fiscal 2011.
A 10% change in our gift card breakage rate at February26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $14million in fiscal 2011.
A 10% change in our customer loyalty program liability at February26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $6million in fiscal 2011.
62 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Costs Associated With Exit Activities We occasionally vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease. For vacated locations with remaining lease commitments, we record an expense for the difference between the present value of our future lease payments and related costs (e.g., real estate taxes and common area maintenance) from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term, net of expected future sublease rental income.
Our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience; our analysis of the specific real estate market, including input from independent real estate firms; and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Cash flows are discounted using a risk-free interest rate that coincides with the remaining lease term.
The liability recorded for location closures contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods, the amount and timing of future settlement payments, and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income. When making these assumptions, management considers a number of factors, including historical settlement experience, the owner of the property, the location and condition of the property, the terms of the underlying lease, the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
A 10% change in our location closing liability at February26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $5million in fiscal 2011.
Stock-Based Compensation We have a stock-based compensation plan, which includes non-qualified stock options and nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , and Note8, Shareholders' Equity , to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K, for a complete discussion of our stock-based compensation programs.
We determine the fair value of our non-qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using option-pricing models. Non-qualified stock option awards are primarily valued using a lattice model.
We determine the fair value of our market-based and performance-based nonvested share awards at the date of grant using generally accepted valuation techniques and the closing market price of our stock.
Management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation awards.
Option-pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.
Performance-based nonvested share awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock-based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock-based compensation expense that could be material.
If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock-based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock-based compensation.
A 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense for the year ended February26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $7million in fiscal 2011.
63 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Self-Insured Liabilities We are self-insured for certain losses related to health, workers' compensation and general liability claims, as well as customer warranty and insurance programs, although we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims. We maintain wholly-owned insurance captives to manage a portion of these self-insured liabilities.
When estimating our self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries.
Periodically, we review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self-insured liabilities.
Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our self-insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self-insured liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
A 10% change in our self-insured liabilities at February26, 2011, would have affected net earnings by approximately $8million in fiscal 2011.
Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. Noncontrolling interests' proportionate ownership of assets and liabilities are recorded at historical carrying values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill.
We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as tradenames and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.
Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies.
During the last three fiscal years, we completed three significant acquisitions: In February 2009, we acquired the remaining 25% interest in Five Star for $196million, after having acquired a 75% interest in Five Star in June 2006.
In October 2008, we acquired Napster for $122million, including transaction costs.
In June 2008, we acquired a 50% interest in BestBuy Europe for $2.2billion, including transaction costs.
See Note2, Acquisitions, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K, for the final purchase price allocations completed in fiscal 2010 for such acquisitions.
New Accounting Standards Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance on the treatment of a consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIE") in response to concerns about the application of certain key provisions of pre-existing guidance, including those regarding the transparency of an involvement with a VIE. Specifically, this new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a VIE and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. In addition, this new guidance requires additional disclosures about an involvement with a VIE and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2009. As such, we adopted the new guidance on February28, 2010 and determined that it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
64 Table of Contents Transfers of Financial Assets In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on the treatment of transfers of financial assets which eliminates the concept of a "qualifying special-purpose entity," changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and requires additional disclosures in order to enhance information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, and an entity's continuing involvement in and exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2009. As such, we adopted the new guidance on February28, 2010 and determined that it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Item7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our International segment operations. On a limited basis, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our Canada and Europe businesses enter into the contracts primarily to hedge certain non-functional currency transaction exposures.
The aggregate notional amount related to our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, was $757million and $1.1billion, respectively. The fair value recorded on our consolidated balance sheet related to our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, was $(1)million and $4million, respectively. The amount recorded in our consolidated statement of net earnings related to all contracts settled and outstanding was a gain of $24million in fiscal 2011, and a loss of $1million in fiscal 2010.
The overall weakness of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar since the end of fiscal 2010 has had a positive overall impact on our revenue and net earnings as the foreign denominations translated into more U.S. dollars. However, the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the U.K. pound has had a negative overall impact on our revenue. It is not possible to determine the exact impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; however, the effect on reported revenue and net earnings can be estimated. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net favorable impact on our revenue and net earnings in fiscal 2011 of approximately $297million and $6million, respectively. Similarly, we estimate that the overall weakness of the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on our revenue and net earnings in fiscal 2010 of approximately $41million and $12million, respectively.
Interest Rate Risk Short- and long-term debt At February26, 2011, our short- and long-term debt was comprised primarily of credit facilities, our convertible debentures and our 2013 Notes. We do not manage the interest rate risk on our debt through the use of derivative instruments.
Our credit facilities' interest rates may be reset due to fluctuations in a market-based index, such as the federal funds rate, LIBOR, or the base rate or prime rate of our lenders. A hypothetical 100-basis-point change in the interest rates on the outstanding balance of our credit facilities at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, would change our annual pre-tax earnings by $6million and $7million, respectively.
There is no interest rate risk associated with our convertible debentures or 2013 Notes, as the interest rates are fixed at 2.25% and 6.75%, respectively, per annum.
65 Table of Contents Long-term investments in debt securities At February26, 2011, our long-term investments in debt securities were comprised of ARS. These investments are not subject to material interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100-basis-point change in the interest rate on such investments at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, would change our annual pre-tax earnings by $1million and $3million, respectively. We do not manage interest rate risk on our investments in debt securities through the use of derivative instruments.
Other Market Risks Investments in auction rate securities At February26, 2011, we held $110million in investments in ARS, which includes a $5million pre-tax temporary impairment, compared to $280million in investments in ARS and a $5million pre-tax temporary impairment at February27, 2010. Given current conditions in the ARS market as described above in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, included in Item7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form10-K, we may incur additional temporary unrealized losses or other-than-temporary realized losses in the future if market conditions were to persist and we were unable to recover the cost of our ARS investments. A hypothetical 100-basis-point loss from the par value of these investments at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, would result in an impairment of $1million and $3million, respectively.
Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Management's Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements Our management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related financial information. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and necessarily include certain amounts that are based on estimates and informed judgments. Our management also prepared the related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form10-K and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been audited by Deloitte& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which conducted its audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (U.S.). The independent registered public accounting firm's responsibility is to express an opinion as to the fairness with which such financial statements present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with GAAP.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) Provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and Board; and (3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
66 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2011, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
Based on our assessment, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February26, 2011. During our assessment, we did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte& Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements for the year ended February26, 2011, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form10-K, has issued an unqualified attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2011.

Muehlbauer Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer (duly authorized and principal financial officer) 67 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of BestBuy Co., Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BestBuyCo., Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the each of the three years in the period ended February26, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item15(a). These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BestBuy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries as of February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February26, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended February27, 2010, the Company changed its method of accounting for noncontrolling interests for all periods presented with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification810, Consolidation .
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated April25, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Minneapolis, Minnesota April25, 2011 68 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of BestBuy Co., Inc.: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of February26, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended February26, 2011 of the Company and our report dated April25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the Company's change in its method of accounting for noncontrolling interests with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification810, Consolidation .

73 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Unless the context otherwise requires, the use of the terms "we," "us" and "our" in these notes to consolidated financial statements refers to BestBuy Co., Inc. and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries. We are a multinational retailer of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment products, appliances and related services.
We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of store, call center and online operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S., operating under the brand names BestBuy, BestBuy Mobile, Geek Squad, Magnolia Audio Video, Napster and Pacific Sales. U.S. BestBuy stores offer a wide variety of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment products, appliances and related services. BestBuy Mobile offers a wide selection of mobile phones, accessories and related services. Geek Squad provides residential and commercial computer repair, support and installation services. Magnolia Audio Video stores offer high-end audio and video products and related services. Napster is an online provider of digital music. Pacific Sales stores offer high-end home-improvement products including appliances, consumer electronics and related services.
The International segment is comprised of: (i)all Canada store, call center and online operations, operating under the brand names BestBuy, BestBuy Mobile, Cell Shop, Connect Pro, Future Shop and Geek Squad, (ii)all Europe store, call center and online operations, operating under the brand names BestBuy, The Carphone Warehouse, The Phone House and Geek Squad, (iii)all China store, call center and online operations, operating under the brand names BestBuy, Geek Squad and Five Star, (iv)all Mexico store operations operating under the brand names BestBuy and Geek Squad and (v)all Turkey store operations, operating under the brand names BestBuy and Geek Squad. Our International segment offers products and services similar to those of our U.S. BestBuy stores. However, BestBuy Canada stores do not carry appliances and BestBuy China and Five Star stores do not carry entertainment products. Further, our small-format stores and offerings in Europe are similar to our BestBuy Mobile format and offerings in the U.S., primarily offering mobile phones, voice and data service plans, and related accessories and services.
In support of our retail store operations, we also maintain Web sites for each of our brands including, but not limited to, BestBuy.com, BestBuy.ca, BestBuy.co.uk, BestBuyMobile.com, CarphoneWarehouse.com, Five-Star.cn, FutureShop.ca, Napster.com, and PhoneHouse.com.
Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BestBuy Co., Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Investments in unconsolidated entities over which we exercise significant influence but do not have control are accounted for using the equity method. We have eliminated all intercompany accounts and transactions.
In order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions, we consolidate the financial results of our Europe, China, Mexico and Turkey operations on a two-month lag. Our policy is to accelerate recording the effect of events occurring in the lag period that significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. Except for our fiscal 2011 restructuring, for which we recorded the effects of certain restructuring charges, no significant intervening event occurred in these operations that would have materially affected our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or other factors had it been recorded during fiscal 2011. Accordingly, the $171 of restructuring charges related to our International segment were included in our fiscal 2011 results. For further information about our fiscal 2011 restructuring and the nature of the charges we recorded, refer to Note5, Restructuring Charges .
In preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we evaluated the period from February27, 2011 through the date the financial statements were issued for material subsequent events requiring recognition or disclosure.
74 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted Other than the issuance of $1,000 of long-term debt in March 2011, as described in Note16, Subsequent Event , no such events were identified for this period.
Reclassifications To maintain consistency and comparability, during fiscal 2010 certain amounts from previously reported consolidated financial statements were reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation. As a result of our adoption of accounting guidance in fiscal 2010 related to the treatment of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, we:  reported as separate captions within our consolidated statements of earnings, net earnings including noncontrolling interests, net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, and net earnings attributable to BestBuy Co., Inc. of $1,033, $(30) and $1,003, respectively, for the fiscal year ended February28, 2009;  utilized net earnings including noncontrolling interests of $1,033 for the fiscal year ended February28, 2009, as the starting point on our consolidated statements of cash flows in order to reconcile net earnings to cash flows from operating activities, rather than beginning with net earnings, which was previously exclusive of noncontrolling interests; and  reclassified $(146)from acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired within the investing activities section of our consolidated statements of cash flows to acquisition of noncontrolling interests within the financing activities section for the fiscal year ended February28, 2009.
These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported consolidated operating income, net earnings attributable to BestBuy Co., Inc., or net cash flows from operating activities. Also, earnings per share continues to be based on net earnings attributable to BestBuy Co., Inc.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Future results could be materially affected if actual results were to differ from these estimates and assumptions.
Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of February. Fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 each included 52weeks.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash primarily consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills, commercial paper and time deposits such as certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased. The amounts of cash equivalents at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, were $120 and $1,108, respectively, and the weighted-average interest rates were 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively.
Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit (book overdrafts) totaled $57 and $108 at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, respectively, and are reflected as accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets.
Receivables Receivables consist principally of amounts due from mobile phone network operators for commissions earned; banks for customer credit card, certain debit card and electronic benefits transfer (EBT) transactions; and vendors for various vendor funding programs.
75 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted We establish allowances for uncollectible receivables based on historical collection trends and write-off history. Our allowances for uncollectible receivables were $107 and $101 at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, respectively.
Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost using either the average cost or first-in first-out method, or market. In-bound freight-related costs from our vendors are included as part of the net cost of merchandise inventories. Also included in the cost of inventory are certain vendor allowances that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs to promote a vendor's products. Other costs associated with acquiring, storing and transporting merchandise inventories to our retail stores are expensed as incurred and included in cost of goods sold.
Our inventory valuation reflects adjustments for anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) that have occurred since the last physical inventory. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure that the inventory reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated.
Our inventory valuation also reflects markdowns for the excess of the cost over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory. Markdowns establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis.
Restricted Assets Restricted cash and investments in debt securities totaled $490 and $496, at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, respectively, and are included in other current assets or equity and other investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Such balances are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for vendor payables, general liability insurance, workers' compensation insurance and warranty programs.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period from the date the assets are placed in service to the end of the initial lease term. Leasehold improvements made significantly after the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term, including renewal periods, if reasonably assured. Accelerated depreciation methods are generally used for income tax purposes.
When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our consolidated balance sheets and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings.
Repairs and maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated.
Costs associated with the acquisition or development of software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the software, from three to seven years. A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal-use software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the software's functionality or extends its useful life. Capitalized software is included in fixtures and equipment. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period incurred.
Property under capital lease is comprised of buildings and equipment used in our retail operations and corporate support functions. The related depreciation for capital lease assets is included in depreciation expense. The carrying value of 76 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted property under capital lease was $74 and $54 at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, respectively, net of accumulated depreciation of $45 and $41, respectively.
Estimated useful lives by major asset category are as follows: Asset Life (in years) Buildings 25-50 Leasehold improvements 3-25 Fixtures and equipment 3-20 Property under capital lease 2-20 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Costs Associated With Exit Activities Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or planned operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or significant changes in our business strategies. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset (if any) are less than the carrying value of the asset. When an impairment loss is recognized, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value based on quoted market prices or other valuation techniques (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis).
The present value of costs associated with location closings, primarily future lease costs (net of expected sublease income), are charged to earnings when we have ceased using the specific location. We accelerate depreciation on property and equipment we expect to retire when a decision is made to abandon a location.
At February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, the obligation associated with location closings was $76 and $78, respectively, and is included within accrued liabilities and long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The obligation associated with location closings at February26, 2011, included amounts associated with our fiscal 2011 restructuring activities.
Leases We conduct the majority of our retail and distribution operations from leased locations. The leases require payment of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance, in addition to rent. The terms of our lease agreements generally range from 10 to 20years. Most of the leases contain renewal options and escalation clauses, and certain store leases require contingent rents based on factors such as specified percentages of revenue or the consumer price index.
For leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis from the date we take possession of the property to the end of the initial lease term. We record any difference between the straight-line rent amounts and amounts payable under the leases as part of deferred rent, in accrued liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appropriate.
Cash or lease incentives received upon entering into certain store leases ("tenant allowances") are recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction to rent from the date we take possession of the property through the end of the initial lease term. We record the unamortized portion of tenant allowances as a part of deferred rent, in accrued liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appropriate.
At February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, deferred rent included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets was $34 and $38, respectively, and deferred rent included in long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets was $343 and $309, respectively.
77 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted We also lease certain equipment under noncancelable operating and capital leases. In addition, we have financing leases for which the gross cost of constructing the asset is included in property and equipment, and amounts reimbursed from the landlord are recorded as financing obligations. Assets acquired under capital and financing leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term, including renewal periods, if reasonably assured.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. We do not amortize goodwill but test it for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or when indications of potential impairment exist. We monitor the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year.
Tradenames and Customer Relationships We have indefinite-lived intangible assets related to our Pacific Sales and Napster tradenames, which are included in our Domestic segment. We also have indefinite-lived intangible assets related to our Future Shop and Five Star tradenames and definite-lived intangible assets related to our The Carphone Warehouse and The Phone House tradenames, which are included in our International segment. Additionally, we have definite-lived intangible assets related to customer relationships acquired as part of our acquisition of BestBuy Europe, which are also included in our International segment.
Our valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired is based on information and assumptions available to us at the time of acquisition, using income and market approaches to determine fair value. We test our indefinite-lived tradenames annually for impairment, or when indications of potential impairment exist.
Our tradenames and customer relationships were as follows: February26, 2011 February27, 2010 Tradenames Customer Relationships Tradenames Customer Relationships Indefinite-lived $ 105 $  $ 112 $  Definite-lived 28 203 47 279 Total $ 133 $ 203 $ 159 $ 279 Goodwill Impairment Testing We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.
The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value.
78 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted We carry forward the detailed determination of the fair value of a reporting unit in our annual goodwill impairment analysis if three criteria are met: (1)the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination; (2)the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin; and (3)based on an analysis of events that have occurred since the most recent fair value determination, the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote. For all other reporting units, we perform a detailed determination of fair value of the reporting unit.
Our detailed impairment analysis involves the use of a discounted cash flow model. Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit. Critical assumptions include projected comparable store sales growth, store count, gross profit rates, selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A") rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures and terminal growth rates, as well as an appropriate discount rate. Discount rates are determined separately for each reporting unit using the capital asset pricing model, and for fiscal 2011 ranged from 8.5% to 12.5%. We also use comparable market earnings multiple data and our company's market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations.
In fiscal 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $62 relating to our former Speakeasy business. The decline in the fair value of Speakeasy was primarily the result of revenue forecasts that were lower than what we originally anticipated, which was partly due to lower-than-expected synergies with our other businesses. There were no goodwill impairments for any of our other reporting units in fiscal 2009.
In fiscal 2010, we identified no goodwill impairments. We determined that the fair value of the Speakeasy business, which had a remaining goodwill carrying value of $12, approximated its carrying value. For all of our other reporting units, we determined that the excess of fair value over carrying value was substantial.
In fiscal 2011, we identified no goodwill impairments. For all of our reporting units, we determined that the excess of fair value over carrying value was substantial. As a result of the sale of our Speakeasy business in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we wrote off the carrying value of the goodwill associated with such business as of the date of sale. See Note14, Sale of Business , for additional information regarding the sale.
Indefinite-Lived Tradename Impairment Testing We utilize the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of each our indefinite-lived tradenames. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess. Significant management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions, including projected revenue, royalty rates and appropriate discount rates. Royalty rates used are consistent with those assumed for original purchase accounting. Other assumptions are consistent with those we use for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
In fiscal 2009, we recorded an impairment charge of $4 relating to our Speakeasy tradename. The primary cause of the decline in the fair value of the tradename was the lower revenue forecasts discussed above. In fiscal 2010, we identified no indefinite-lived tradename impairments. As a result of the sale of our Speakeasy business in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we wrote off the carrying value of the indefinite-lived tradename associated with such business as of the date of sale. See Note14, Sale of Business , for additional information regarding the sale. Furthermore, as part of our fiscal 2011 restructuring, we recorded an impairment charge of $10 related to certain indefinite-lived tradenames in our Domestic segment. See Note5, Restructuring Charges , for additional information regarding the restructuring.
79 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived tradenames by segment were as follows in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009: Goodwill Indefinite-Lived Tradenames Domestic International Total Domestic International Total Balances at March1, 2008 $ 450 $ 638 $ 1,088 $ 23 $ 74 $ 97 Acquisitions 46 1,641 1,687 13 8 21 Tax adjustment (1)  17 17    Impairments (62 )  (62 ) (4 )  (4 ) Changes in foreign currency exchange rates  (527 ) (527 )  (10 ) (10 ) Balances at February28, 2009 434 1,769 2,203 32 72 104 Purchase accounting adjustments (1)  48 48    Changes in foreign currency exchange rates  201 201  8 8 Balances at February27, 2010 434 2,018 2,452 32 80 112 Acquisitions  5 5    Impairments    (10 )  (10 ) Sale of business (12 )  (12 ) (1 )  (1 ) Changes in foreign currency exchange rates  9 9  4 4 Balances at February26, 2011 $ 422 $ 2,032 $ 2,454 $ 21 $ 84 $ 105 (1) The adjustment in fiscal 2009 related to the resolution of certain tax matters associated with our acquisitions of Future Shop and Five Star, and in fiscal 2010, the finalization of the purchase price allocations from our acquisitions of BestBuy Europe and Five Star (see Note2, Acquisitions) .

At February26, 2011, future amortization expense for identifiable intangible assets for the next five fiscal years was expected to be: Fiscal Year 2012 $ 60 2013 44 2014 39 2015 35 2016 35 Thereafter 18 Lease Rights Lease rights represent costs incurred to acquire the lease of a specific commercial property. Lease rights are recorded at cost and are amortized to rent expense over the remaining lease term, including renewal periods, if reasonably assured. Amortization periods range up to 15years, beginning with the date we take possession of the property.
The following table provides the gross carrying amount and related accumulated amortization of lease rights: February26, 2011 February27, 2010 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Lease rights $ 131 $ (57 ) $ 137 $ (46 ) Lease rights amortization expense was $14, $18 and $9 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We expect current lease rights amortization expense to be approximately $9 for each of the next five fiscal years.
Investments Debt Securities Our long-term investments in debt securities are comprised of auction-rate securities ("ARS"). In accordance with accounting guidance for the treatment of certain investments in debt and equity securities, and based on our ability to market and sell these instruments, we classify ARS as available-for-sale and carry them at fair value. ARS were intended to behave like short-term debt instruments because their interest rates reset periodically through an auction process, typically at intervals of seven, 28 and 35days. Investments in these securities can be sold for cash at par value on the auction date if the auction is successful. The majority of our ARS are AAA/Aaa-rated and collateralized by student loans, which are guaranteed 95% to 100% by the U.S. government. We also hold ARS that are in the form of municipal revenue bonds, which are AA/Aa-rated and insured by bond insurers. We do not have any investments in securities that are collateralized by assets that include mortgages or subprime debt. Our intent with these investments is not to hold these securities to maturity, but to use the periodic auction feature to provide liquidity as needed. See Note3, Investments , for further information.
In accordance with our investment policy, we place our investments in debt securities with issuers who have high-quality credit and limit the amount of investment exposure to any one issuer. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain a desired level of liquidity to meet working capital needs. We seek to preserve principal and minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk.
Marketable Equity Securities We also invest in marketable equity securities and classify them as available-for-sale. Investments in marketable equity securities are included in equity and other investments in our consolidated balance sheets, and are reported at fair value 81 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted based on quoted market prices. All unrealized holding gains and losses are reflected net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity.
Other Investments We also have investments that are accounted for on either the cost method or the equity method that we include in equity and other investments in our consolidated balance sheets.
We review the key characteristics of our debt, marketable equity securities and other investments portfolio and their classification in accordance with GAAP on an annual basis, or when indications of potential impairment exist. If a decline in the fair value of a security is deemed by management to be other-than-temporary, we write down the cost basis of the investment to fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net earnings.
Insurance We are self-insured for certain losses related to health, workers' compensation and general liability claims, as well as customer warranty and insurance programs, although we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims. A portion of these self-insured losses are managed through wholly-owned insurance captives. We estimate our self-insured liabilities using a number of factors, including historical claims experience, an estimate of incurred but not reported claims, demographic factors and severity factors, and utilizing valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries. Our self-insured liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows: February26, 2011 February27, 2010 Accrued liabilities $ 81 $ 64 Long-term liabilities 49 46 Total $ 130 $ 110 Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates we expect to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those temporary differences to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in income tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated statement of earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
In determining our provision for income taxes, we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. The effective income tax rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits. We adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.
Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be 82 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted realized. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and effectively settled. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. We include our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, in accrued income taxes and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of earnings.
Accrued Liabilities The major components of accrued liabilities at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, were deferred revenue, state and local tax liabilities, rent-related liabilities including accrued real estate taxes, loyalty program liabilities and self-insurance reserves.
Long-Term Liabilities The major components of long-term liabilities at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, were unrecognized tax benefits, rent-related liabilities, deferred revenue, deferred income tax liabilities, deferred compensation plan liabilities and self-insurance reserves.
Foreign Currency Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at our consolidated balance sheet date. For operations reported on a two-month lag, we use the exchange rates in effect two months prior to our consolidated balance sheet date. Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, which are included in SG&A, have not been significant.
Revenue Recognition Our revenue arises primarily from sales of merchandise and services. We also record revenue from sales of extended warranties and other service contracts, commissions earned from various customer subscriptions, fees earned from private label and co-branded credit card agreements and amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling. Revenue excludes sales taxes collected.
We recognize revenue when the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and the customer takes possession of the merchandise, or in the case of services, at the time the service is provided. Revenue is recognized for store sales when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise. For online sales, we defer revenue and the related product costs for shipments that are in-transit to the customer, and recognize revenue at the time the customer receives the product. Online customers typically receive goods within a few days of shipment. Revenue from merchandise sales and services is reported net of sales returns, including an estimate of future returns based on historical return rates. Our sales returns reserve, which represents the gross profit effect of our sales returns, was $15 and $17, at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, respectively.
We sell extended warranties and other service contracts that typically have terms ranging from three months to four years. We also receive commissions for customer subscriptions with various third parties, notably from mobile phone network operators. In instances where we are deemed to be the obligor on the service contract or subscription, the service and commission revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the service contract or subscription period. In instances where we are not deemed to be the obligor on the service contract or subscription, commissions are recognized 83 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted in revenue when such commission has been earned, primarily driven by customer activation. Commissions from the sale of extended warranties represented 2.0%, 2.0% and 2.0% of revenue in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
For revenue transactions that involve multiple deliverables, we defer the revenue associated with any undelivered elements. The amount of revenue deferred in connection with the undelivered elements is determined using the relative fair value of each element, which is generally based on each element's relative retail price.
At February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, deferred revenue included within accrued liabilities and long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets was $499 and $451, respectively.
For additional information related to our credit card arrangements, see Credit Services and Financing, below.
For additional information regarding our customer loyalty programs, see Sales Incentives , below.
Gift Cards We sell gift cards to our customers in our retail stores, through our Web sites and through selected third parties. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards, and our gift cards do not have an expiration date. We recognize revenue from gift cards when: (i)the gift card is redeemed by the customer, or (ii)the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote ("gift card breakage"), and we determine that we do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions. We determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns. Based on our historical information, the likelihood of a gift card remaining unredeemed can be determined 24months after the gift card is issued. At that time, we recognize breakage income for those cards for which the likelihood of redemption is deemed remote and we do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions. Gift card breakage income is included in revenue in our consolidated statements of earnings.
Gift card breakage income was as follows in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Gift card breakage income $ 53 $ 43 $ 38 Credit Services and Financing In the U.S., we have private-label and co-branded credit card agreements with banks for the issuance of promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards bearing the BestBuy brand. Under the agreements, the banks manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Cardholders who choose a private-label credit card can receive low- or zero-interest promotional financing on qualifying purchases.
The banks are the sole owner of the accounts receivable generated under the programs and absorb losses associated with non-payment by the cardholders and fraudulent usage of the accounts. Accordingly, sales generated through our private-label and co-branded credit cards are not reflected in our receivables. We earn revenue from fees the banks pay to us based on the number of credit card accounts activated and card usage. In accordance with accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, we defer revenue received from cardholder account activations and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the applicable agreement. The banks may also reimburse us for certain costs such as tender costs and Reward Zone points associated with our programs. We pay financing fees, which are recognized as a reduction of revenue, to the banks, and these fees are variable based on certain factors such as the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), charge volume and/or the types of promotional financing offers.
We also have similar agreements for the issuance of private-label and/or co-branded credit cards with banks for our businesses in Canada, China and Mexico, which we account for consistent with the U.S. credit card agreements.
84 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted In addition to our private-label and co-branded credit cards, we also accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover, JCB and American Express credit cards, as well as debit cards from all major international networks.
Sales Incentives We frequently offer sales incentives that entitle our customers to receive a reduction in the price of a product or service. Sales incentives include discounts, coupons and other offers that entitle a customer to receive a reduction in the price of a product or service either at the point of sale or by submitting a claim for a refund or rebate. For sales incentives issued to a customer in conjunction with a sale of merchandise or services, for which we are the obligor, the reduction in revenue is recognized at the time of sale, based on the retail value of the incentive expected to be redeemed.
Customer Loyalty Programs We have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each qualifying purchase. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases at our BestBuy branded stores. There are two ways that members may participate and earn loyalty points.
First, we have customer loyalty programs where members earn points for each purchase completed at our BestBuy branded stores or through our related Web sites in the U.S. and Canada. Depending on the customer's membership level within our loyalty program, certificates expire either three or six months from the date of issuance. The retail value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the percentage of points that are projected to be redeemed.
Second, under our co-branded credit card agreements with banks, we have a customer loyalty credit card bearing the BestBuy brand. Cardholders earn points for purchases made at our BestBuy branded stores and related Web sites in the U.S. and Canada, as well as purchases at other merchants. Points earned enable cardholders to receive certificates that may be redeemed on future purchases at our Best Buy branded stores and related Web sites. Certificates expire six months from the date of issuance. The retail value of points earned by our cardholders is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the percentage of points that are projected to be redeemed.
We recognize revenue when: (i)a certificate is redeemed by the customer, (ii)a certificate expires or (iii)the likelihood of a certificate being redeemed by a customer is remote ("certificate breakage"). We determine our certificate breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns.
85 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted Cost of Goods Sold and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table illustrates the primary costs classified in each major expense category: Cost of Goods Sold  Total cost of products sold including:  Freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from our vendors to our distribution centers;  Vendor allowances that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs to promote a vendor's products; and  Cash discounts on payments to merchandise vendors;  Cost of services provided including:  Payroll and benefits costs for services employees; and  Cost of replacement parts and related freight expenses;  Physical inventory losses;  Markdowns;  Customer shipping and handling expenses;  Costs associated with operating our distribution network, including payroll and benefit costs, occupancy costs, and depreciation; and  Freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from our distribution centers to our retail stores.
SG&A  Payroll and benefit costs for retail and corporate employees;  Occupancy and maintenance costs of retail, services and corporate facilities;  Depreciation and amortization related to retail, services and corporate assets;  Advertising costs;  Vendor allowances that are a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs to promote a vendor's products;  Tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees;  Charitable contributions;  Outside and outsourced service fees;  Long-lived asset impairment charges; and  Other administrative costs, such as supplies, and travel and lodging.
Vendor Allowances We receive funds from vendors for various programs, primarily as reimbursements for costs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and sales incentives.
Vendor allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor's products are included as an expense reduction when the cost is incurred. All other vendor allowances are generally in the form of receipt-based funds or sell-through credits. Receipt-based funds are generally determined based on our level of inventory purchases and initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventories. The deferred amounts are then included as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related product is sold. Sell-through credits are generally based on the number of units we sell over a specified period and are recognized when the related product is sold.
Vendor allowances included in SG&A for reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs to promote and sell a vendor's products were $69, $139 and $161 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease for fiscal 86 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted 2011 was due to a change in the form of vendor contracts that led to a higher proportion of vendor allowances being classified within cost of goods sold.
Advertising Costs Advertising costs, which are included in SG&A, are expensed the first time the advertisement runs. Advertising costs consist primarily of print and television advertisements as well as promotional events. Net advertising expenses were $901, $740 and $765 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Allowances received from vendors for advertising of $98 and $117, in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively, were classified as reductions of advertising expenses. As a result of a change in the form of vendor contracts, we received no allowances from vendors for advertising expenses that were deemed specific, incremental and identifiable in fiscal 2011.
Pre-Opening Costs Non-capital expenditures associated with opening new stores are expensed as incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation We apply the fair value recognition provisions of accounting guidance as they relate to our stock-based compensation, which require us to recognize expense for the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards. We elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by the share-based payment accounting guidance. Under this transition method, stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 included: (i)compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of February26, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the prior accounting guidance for the treatment of stock-based compensation; and (ii)compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted subsequent to February26, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of the revised guidance. We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award (or to an employee's eligible retirement date, if earlier). In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, financial results for prior periods have not been restated.
New Accounting Standards Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance on the treatment of a consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIE") in response to concerns about the application of certain key provisions of pre-existing guidance, including those regarding the transparency of an involvement with a VIE. Specifically, this new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a VIE and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. In addition, this new guidance requires additional disclosures about an involvement with a VIE and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2009. As such, we adopted the new guidance on February28, 2010 and determined that it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Transfers of Financial Assets In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on the treatment of transfers of financial assets which eliminates the concept of a "qualifying special-purpose entity," changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and requires additional disclosures in order to enhance information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, and an entity's continuing involvement in and exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2009. As such, we adopted the new guidance on February28, 2010 and determined that it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
87 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted 2.Acquisitions Five Star We acquired a 75% interest in Jiangsu Five Star Appliance Co., Ltd. ("Five Star") in June 2006, for $184, which included a working capital injection of $122. At the time of the acquisition, we also entered into an agreement with Five Star's minority shareholders to acquire the remaining 25% interest in Five Star within four years, subject to Chinese government approval.
In February 2009, we acquired the remaining 25% interest in Five Star, which converted Five Star into a wholly-owned foreign enterprise. The $196 purchase price for the remaining 25% interest was primarily based on a previously agreed-upon pricing formula, consisting of a base purchase price and an earn-out for the remaining Five Star shareholders. At the time of the initial purchase, we agreed to pay an amount in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired to further our international growth plans and accelerate the integration of BestBuy and Five Star stores in China.
The acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in Five Star for $196 was accounted for using the purchase method. We recorded the net assets acquired at their estimated fair values. We included Five Star's operating results, which are reported on a two-month lag, from the date of acquisition as part of our International segment. The allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities was finalized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, with no material adjustments made to the preliminary allocation. None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
The final purchase price allocation for the remaining 25% interest in Five Star was as follows: Net assets of noncontrolling interests $ 48 Tradename 8 Goodwill 142 Total assets 198 Long-term liabilities (2 ) Purchase price allocated to assets and liabilities acquired $ 196 Napster In October 2008, we acquired Napster, Inc. ("Napster") for $122 (or $101 net of cash acquired), pursuant to a cash tender offer whereby all issued and outstanding shares of Napster common stock, and all stock purchase rights associated with such shares, were acquired by us at a price of $2.65 per share. Of the $122 purchase price, $4 represented our previous ownership interest in Napster common shares. The effective acquisition date for accounting purposes was the close of business on October31, 2008, the end of Napster's fiscal October.
We entered into this transaction as we believe Napster has one of the most comprehensive and easy-to-use digital music offerings in the industry. The amount we paid in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired was to obtain Napster's capabilities and digital subscriber base to reach new customers with an enhanced experience for exploring and selecting music and other digital entertainment products over an increasing array of devices, such as bundling the sale of hardware with digital services. We believe the combined capabilities of our two companies allows us to build stronger relationships with customers and expand the number of subscribers.
We have consolidated Napster in our financial results as part of our Domestic segment from the date of acquisition. We recorded the net assets acquired at their estimated fair values and allocated the purchase price on a preliminary basis using information then available. The allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities was finalized in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, with no material adjustments made to the preliminary allocation. None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

All conditions to closing were satisfied, and the transaction was consummated on June30, 2008. The effective acquisition date for accounting purposes was the close of business on June28, 2008, the end of CPW's fiscal first quarter. Pursuant to the transaction, CPW contributed certain assets and liabilities into a newly-formed company, BestBuy Europe Distributions Limited ("BestBuy Europe"), in exchange for all of the ordinary shares of BestBuy Europe, and our wholly-owned subsidiary, BestBuy Distributions Limited, purchased 50% of such ordinary shares of Best Buy Europe from CPW for a purchase price of $2,167. In addition to the purchase price paid to CPW, we incurred $29 of transaction costs for an aggregate purchase price of $2,196.
Pursuant to our June 2008 shareholders' agreement, as amended, with CPW, our designees to the Best Buy Europe board of directors have ultimate approval rights over select BestBuy Europe senior management positions and the annual capital and operating budgets of BestBuy Europe.
The assets and liabilities contributed to BestBuy Europe by CPW included CPW's retail and distribution business, consisting of retail stores and online offerings; mobile airtime reselling operations; device insurance operations; fixed line telecommunications businesses in Spain and Switzerland; facilities management business, under which it bills and manages the customers of mobile phone network operators in the U.K.; dealer business, under which it acts as a wholesale distributor of handsets and airtime vouchers; and economic interests in pre-existing commercial arrangements with us (BestBuy Mobile in the U.S. and Geek Squad in the U.K. and Spain).
The portion of the purchase price we paid in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired was primarily for (i)the expected future cash flows derived from the existing business and infrastructure contributed to BestBuy Europe by CPW, which included over 2,400 retail stores, (ii)immediate access to the European market with a management team that is experienced in both retailing and wireless service technologies in this marketplace, and (iii)the expected synergies our management believes the venture will generate, which include benefits from joint purchasing, sourcing and merchandising. In addition, BestBuy Europe introduced new product and service offerings in its retail stores in fiscal 2010 and, during 89 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted fiscal 2011, launched large-format BestBuy branded stores in the U.K. and a related online channel in the European market.
We have consolidated BestBuy Europe in our financial results as part of our International segment from the date of acquisition. We consolidate the financial results of BestBuy Europe on a two-month lag to align with CPW's quarterly reporting periods.
We recorded the net assets acquired at their estimated fair values and allocated the purchase price on a preliminary basis using information then available. The allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities was finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, with no material adjustments made to the preliminary allocation. None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
The final purchase price allocation was as follows: Cash and cash equivalents $ 124 Restricted cash 112 Receivables 1,190 Merchandise inventories 535 Other current assets 114 Property and equipment 500 Goodwill 1,546 Tradenames 93 Customer relationships 484 Other assets 184 Total assets 4,882 Accounts payable (803 ) Other current liabilities (695 ) Short-term debt (299 ) Long-term liabilities (246 ) Total liabilities (2,043 ) Noncontrolling interest (1) (643 ) Purchase price allocated to assets and liabilities acquired $ 2,196 (1) We recorded the fair value adjustments only in respect of the 50% of net assets acquired, with the remaining 50% of the net assets of BestBuy Europe being consolidated and recorded at their historical cost basis. This also resulted in a $643 noncontrolling interest being reflected in our consolidated balance sheet in respect of the 50% owned by CPW.
The valuation of the identifiable intangible assets acquired was based on management's estimates, available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions. The valuation was generally based on the fair value of these assets using income and market approaches. The amortizable intangible assets are being amortized using a straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives. The following table summarizes the identified intangible asset categories and their 90 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted respective weighted-average amortization periods based on the purchase price allocation finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2010: Weighted-Average Amortization Period (in years) Fair Value Customer relationships 6.8 $ 484 Tradenames 4.2 93 Total 6.4 $ 577 We recorded an estimate for costs to terminate certain activities associated with BestBuy Europe operations. A restructuring accrual of $20 was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and reflects the accrued restructuring costs incurred at the date of acquisition, primarily for store closure costs and agreement termination fees.
On March26, 2010, CPW demerged into two new holding companies: TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC ("TalkTalk"), which is the holding company for the fixed line voice and broadband telecommunications business of the former CPW, and Carphone Warehouse Group plc ("Carphone Warehouse"), which includes the former CPW's 50% ownership interest in BestBuy Europe. Accordingly, the sale and purchase and shareholders' agreements between the former CPW and us that govern the BestBuy Europe venture were assigned from the former CPW to Carphone Warehouse.
Our interest in BestBuy Europe is separate from our investment in the common stock of the former CPW, now TalkTalk and Carphone Warehouse, as discussed in Note3, Investments .

91 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted 3.Investments Investments were comprised of the following: February26, 2011 February27, 2010 Short-term investments Money market fund $ 2 $ 2 U.S. Treasury bills 20  Debt securities (auction rate securities)  88 Total short-term investments $ 22 $ 90 Equity and other investments Debt securities (auction rate securities) $ 110 $ 192 Marketable equity securities 146 77 Other investments 72 55 Total equity and other investments $ 328 $ 324 Debt Securities Our debt securities are comprised of ARS. ARS were intended to behave like short-term debt instruments because their interest rates reset periodically through an auction process, most commonly at intervals of seven, 28 and 35days. The auction process had historically provided a means by which we could rollover the investment or sell these securities at par in order to provide us with liquidity as needed. As a result, we classify our investments in ARS as available-for-sale and carry them at fair value.
In February 2008, auctions began to fail due to insufficient buyers, as the amount of securities submitted for sale in auctions exceeded the aggregate amount of the bids. For each failed auction, the interest rate on the security moves to a maximum rate specified for each security, and generally resets at a level higher than specified short-term interest rate benchmarks. To date, we have collected all interest due on our ARS and expect to continue to do so in the future. Due to persistent failed auctions, and the uncertainty of when these investments could be liquidated at par, we have classified all of our investments in ARS as non-current assets within equity and other investments in our consolidated balance sheet at February26, 2011.
In October 2008, we accepted a settlement with UBS AG and its affiliates (collectively, "UBS") pursuant to which UBS issued to us SeriesC-2 Auction Rate Securities Rights ("ARS Rights"). The ARS Rights provided us the right to receive the full par value of our UBS-brokered ARS plus accrued but unpaid interest at any time between June30, 2010, and July2, 2012.
During fiscal 2011, we sold $170 of ARS at par, including all, or $88, of the UBS-brokered ARS discussed above. At February26, 2011, our entire remaining ARS portfolio, consisting of 22 investments in ARS having an aggregate par value of $115, was subject to failed auctions. Subsequent to February26, 2011, and through April20, 2011, we sold $14 of ARS at par.
92 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted Our ARS portfolio consisted of the following, at fair value: Description Natureofcollateralorguarantee February26, 2011 February27, 2010 Student loan bonds Student loans guaranteed 95% to 100% by the U.S. government $ 108 $ 261 Municipal revenue bonds 100% insured by AAA/Aaa-rated bond insurers at February26, 2011 2 19 Total fair value plus accrued interest (1) $ 110 $ 280 (1) The par value and weighted-average interest rates (taxable equivalent) of our ARS were $115 and $285 and 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively, at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, respectively.
At February26, 2011, our ARS portfolio was 73% AAA/Aaa-rated, 2% AA/Aa-rated and 25% A/A-rated.
The investment principal associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions occur, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuers establish a different form of financing to replace these securities, or final payments are due according to the contractual maturities of the debt issuances, which range from five to 32years. We intend to hold our ARS until we can recover the full principal amount through one of the means described above, and have the ability to do so based on our other sources of liquidity.
We evaluated our entire ARS portfolio of $115 (par value) for impairment at February26, 2011, based primarily on the methodology described in Note4, Fair Value Measurements . As a result of this review, we determined that the fair value of our ARS portfolio at February26, 2011, was $110. Accordingly, a $5 pre-tax unrealized loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. This unrealized loss reflects a temporary impairment on all of our investments in ARS. The estimated fair value of our ARS portfolio could change significantly based on future market conditions. We will continue to assess the fair value of our ARS portfolio for substantive changes in relevant market conditions, changes in our financial condition or other changes that may alter our estimates described above.
We may be required to record an additional unrealized holding loss or an impairment charge to earnings if we determine that our ARS portfolio has incurred a further decline in fair value that is temporary or other-than-temporary, respectively. Factors that we consider when assessing our ARS portfolio for other-than-temporary impairment include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value, the potential recovery period and the nature of the collateral or guarantees in place, as well as our intent and ability to hold an investment.
We had $(3) unrealized loss, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, related to our investments in debt securities.
Marketable Equity Securities We invest in marketable equity securities and classify them as available-for-sale. Investments in marketable equity securities are classified as non-current assets within equity and other investments in our consolidated balance sheets, and are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices.
93 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted Our investments in marketable equity securities were as follows: February26, 2011 February27, 2010 Common stock of The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC $  $ 74 Common stock of TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC 62  Common stock of Carphone Warehouse Group plc 84  Other  3 Total $ 146 $ 77 We purchased shares of CPW's common stock in fiscal 2008 for $183, representing nearly 3% of CPW's then outstanding shares. In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a $111 other-than-temporary impairment charge. In March 2010, CPW demerged into two new holding companies: TalkTalk and Carphone Warehouse. Accordingly, our investment in CPW was exchanged for equivalent levels of investment in TalkTalk and Carphone Warehouse. An $87 pre-tax unrealized gain is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these investments at February26, 2011.
We review all investments for other-than-temporary impairment at least quarterly or as indicators of impairment exist. Indicators of impairment include the duration and severity of the decline in fair value as well as the intent and ability to hold the investment to allow for a recovery in the market value of the investment. In addition, we consider qualitative factors that include, but are not limited to: (i)the financial condition and business plans of the investee including its future earnings potential, (ii)the investee's credit rating, and (iii)the current and expected market and industry conditions in which the investee operates. If a decline in the fair value of an investment is deemed by management to be other-than-temporary, we write down the cost basis of the investment to fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net earnings.
All unrealized holding gains or losses related to our investments in marketable equity securities are reflected net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. Net unrealized gain, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $75 and $17 at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, respectively.
Other Investments The aggregate carrying values of investments accounted for using either the cost method or the equity method at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, were $72 and $55, respectively.
4.Fair Value Measurements Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. To measure fair value, we use a three-tier valuation hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs: Level1 Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
Level2 Significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level1, either directly or indirectly, including:  Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets;  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and  Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data.
Level3 Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management's estimates of market participant assumptions.
94 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy, our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, according to the valuation techniques we used to determine their fair values.

Debt securities Auction rate securities only Student loan bonds Municipal revenue bonds Auction preferred securities Total Balances at February28, 2009 $ 276 $ 24 $ 14 $ 314 Changes in unrealized losses in other comprehensive income 8 1 1 10 Sales (22 ) (6 ) (15 ) (43 ) Interest received (1 )   (1 ) Balances at February27, 2010 $ 261 $ 19 $  $ 280 Changes in unrealized losses in other comprehensive income (1 ) 1   Sales (152 ) (18 )  (170 ) Balances at February26, 2011 $ 108 $ 2 $  $ 110 96 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument: Money Market Funds.
Our money market fund investments that are traded on an active market were measured at fair value using quoted market prices, and therefore were classified as Level1. Our money market fund investments not trading on a regular basis or in an active market, and for which we have been unable to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis, were measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the investment, and therefore were classified as Level2.
U.S. Treasury Bills.
Our U.S. Treasury notes were classified as Level1 as they trade with sufficient frequency and volume to enable us to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Foreign Currency Derivative Instruments.
Comprised primarily of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency swap contracts, our foreign currency derivative instruments were measured at fair value using readily observable market inputs, such as quotations on forward foreign exchange points and foreign interest rates. Our foreign currency derivative instruments were classified as Level2 as these instruments are custom, over-the-counter contracts with various bank counterparties that are not traded in an active market.
Auction Rate Securities.
Our investments in ARS were classified as Level3 as quoted prices were unavailable due to events described in Note3, Investments . Due to limited market information, we utilized a discounted cash flow ("DCF") model to derive an estimate of fair value. The assumptions used in preparing the DCF model included estimates with respect to the amount and timing of future interest and principal payments, forward projections of the interest rate benchmarks, the probability of full repayment of the principal considering the credit quality and guarantees in place, and the rate of return required by investors to own such securities given the current liquidity risk associated with ARS.
Marketable Equity Securities.
Our marketable equity securities were measured at fair value using quoted market prices. They were classified as Level1 as they trade in an active market for which closing stock prices are readily available.
Deferred Compensation.
Our deferred compensation liabilities and the assets that fund our deferred compensation consist of investments in mutual funds. These investments were classified as Level1 as the shares of these mutual funds trade with sufficient frequency and volume to enable us to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to our tangible fixed assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, which are remeasured when the derived fair value is below carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets. For these assets, we do not periodically adjust carrying value to fair value except in the event of impairment. When we determine that impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value and the difference is recorded within operating income in our consolidated statements of earnings.
With the exception of the fixed asset and tradename impairments associated with our fiscal 2011 restructuring described in Note5, Restructuring Charges , we had no significant remeasurements of such assets or liabilities to fair value during fiscal 2011 and 2010. The following table summarizes the fair value remeasurments recorded for fiscal 2011: Impairments Remaining Net CarryingValue Property and equipment $ 147 $ 51 Tradename 10 3 Total $ 157 $ 54 All of the fair value remeasurments included in the table above were based on significant unobservable inputs (Level3). Fixed asset fair values were derived using a DCF model to estimate the present value of net cash flows that the asset or 97 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted asset group was expected to generate. The key inputs to the DCF model generally included our forecasts of net cash generated from revenue, expenses and other significant cash outflows, such as capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate. For the tradename, fair value was derived using the relief from royalty method, as described in Note1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Our financial instruments, other than those presented in the disclosures above, include cash, receivables, other investments, accounts payable, other payables and short- and long-term debt. The fair values of cash, receivables, accounts payable, other payables and short-term debt approximated carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Fair values for other investments held at cost are not readily available, but we estimate that the carrying values for these investments approximate fair value. See Note6, Debt , for information about the fair value of our long-term debt.
5.Restructuring Charges Fiscal 2011 Restructuring In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we implemented a series of actions to restructure operations in our domestic and international businesses. The restructuring actions included plans to exit the Turkey market, restructure the BestBuy branded stores in China and improve efficiencies in our Domestic segment's operations. As part of the international restructuring, we also impaired certain information technology ("IT") assets supporting the restructured activities in our International segment. We view these restructuring activities as necessary to meet our long-term growth goals by investing in businesses that have the potential to meet our internal rate of return expectations. We believe these actions will improve the financial performance of our International segment and increase efficiency, enhance customer service and reduce costs in our Domestic segment's operations.
We incurred $222 of charges related to the restructuring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Of the total charges, $51 related to our Domestic segment, primarily for inventory write-downs, property and equipment impairments, employee termination benefits and intangible asset impairments. The remaining $171 of the charges impacted our International segment, related to inventory write-downs, property and equipment impairments, employee termination benefits, and facility closure and other costs primarily associated with stores and corporate offices in Turkey and China. Property and equipment impairments in our International segment included IT asset impairments.
We expect further restructuring charges related to these actions to impact both our Domestic and International segments in fiscal 2012. We expect to incur approximately $5 of restructuring charges in our Domestic segment in fiscal 2012, related to facility closure costs. In addition, we expect to incur between $10 and $15 of restructuring charges in our International segment in fiscal 2012, primarily related to employee termination benefits and facility closure and other costs. We expect to be substantially complete with these restructuring activities in fiscal 2012.
The inventory write-downs related to our fiscal 2011 restructuring are presented in the restructuring charges cost of goods sold line item in our consolidated statements of earnings, and the remainder of the restructuring charges are included in the restructuring charges line item in our consolidated statements of earnings. The composition of the 98 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted restructuring charges we incurred in fiscal 2011 for fiscal 2011 restructuring activities, for both the Domestic and International segments, were as follows: Domestic International Total Inventory write-downs $ 10 $ 14 $ 24 Property and equipment impairments 15 132 147 Termination benefits 16 12 28 Intangible asset impairments 10  10 Facility closure and other costs  13 13 Total $ 51 $ 171 $ 222 The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual activity during fiscal 2011, related to termination benefits and facility closure and other costs: Termination Benefits Facility Closureand Other Costs Total Balance at February27, 2010 $  $  $  Charges 28 13 41 Cash payments    Changes in foreign currency exchange rates    Balance at February26, 2011 $ 28 $ 13 $ 41 Fiscal 2010 and 2009 Restructurings In April 2009, we notified our U.S. BestBuy store employees of our intention to update our store operating model, which included eliminating certain positions. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we incurred restructuring charges related to employee termination benefits and business reorganization costs at BestBuy Europe within our International segment. As a result of our restructuring efforts, we recorded charges of $52 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We believe we are substantially complete with our announced restructuring activities related to these specific restructurings.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we implemented a restructuring plan for our domestic and international businesses to support our fiscal 2010 strategy and long-term growth plans. We believe these changes provided an operating structure that supports a more effective and efficient use of our resources and provides a platform from which key strategic initiatives can progress despite changing economic conditions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded charges of $78, related primarily to voluntary and involuntary separation plans at our corporate headquarters.
All charges related to our fiscal 2010 and 2009 restructuring activities were presented as restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of earnings. The composition of the restructuring charges we incurred in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 99 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted 2009, as well as the cumulative amount incurred through the end of fiscal 2011, for our fiscal 2010 and 2009 restructuring activities for both the Domestic and International segments, were as follows: Domestic International Total Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Cumulative Amount Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Cumulative Amount Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Cumulative Amount Termination benefits $  $ 25 $ 69 $ 94 $  $ 26 $ 6 $ 32 $  $ 51 $ 75 $ 126 Facilityclosurecosts   1 1  1  1  1 1 2 Property and equipment write-downs   2 2       2 2 Total $  $ 25 $ 72 $ 97 $  $ 27 $ 6 $ 33 $  $ 52 $ 78 $ 130 The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual activity during fiscal 2011 and 2010, related to termination benefits and facility closure costs associated with our fiscal 2010 and 2009 restructuring activities: Termination Benefits Facility Closure Costs Total Balance at February28, 2009 $ 73 $ 1 $ 74 Charges 51 1 52 Cash payments (119 ) (1 ) (120 ) Changes in foreign currency exchange rates 3  3 Balance at February27, 2010 8 1 9 Charges    Cash payments 8 1 9 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates    Balance at February26, 2011 $  $  $  6.Debt Short-Term Debt Short-term debt consisted of the following: February26, 2011 February27, 2010 Principal Balance Interest Rate Principal Balance Interest Rate JPMorgan revolving credit facility $   $   ARS revolving credit line     Europe receivables financing facility 455 3.7% 442 3.6% Europe revolving credit facility 98 3.6% 206 1.4% Canada revolving demand facility     China revolving demand facilities 4 4.8% 15 4.4% Total short-term debt $ 557 $ 663 Fiscal Year 2011 2010 Maximum month-end outstanding during the year $ 690 $ 1,262 Average amount outstanding during the year $ 383 $ 881 Weighted-average interest rate at year-end 3.7% 2.1% 100 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted JPMorgan Revolving Credit Facility We have a $2.3billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, as amended (the "Credit Facility"), with a syndicate of banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as administrative agent. Amounts outstanding under letters of credit, if any, reduce amounts available under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility expires in September 2012. At February26, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding and $2.3billion was available under the Credit Facility. At April20, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.
Interest rates under the Credit Facility are variable and are determined at our option at: (i)the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or JPMorgan's prime rate, or (ii)the LIBOR plus an applicable LIBOR margin. A facility fee is assessed on the commitment amount. Both the LIBOR margin and the facility fee were set based upon our then current senior unsecured debt rating. The LIBOR margin ranges from 0.32% to 0.60%, and the facility fee ranges from 0.08% to 0.15%.
The Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict or prohibit our ability to incur certain types or amounts of indebtedness, incur liens on certain assets, make material changes to our corporate structure or the nature of our business, dispose of material assets, allow non-material subsidiaries to make guarantees, engage in a change in control transaction, or engage in certain transactions with our affiliates. The Credit Facility also contains covenants that require us to maintain a maximum quarterly cash flow leverage ratio and a minimum quarterly interest coverage ratio. We were in compliance with all such covenants at February26, 2011.
ARS Revolving Credit Line We previously had a revolving credit line with UBS secured by the par value of our UBS-brokered ARS. However, pursuant to the settlement described in Note3, Investments , the revolving credit line expired by its terms during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 when UBS bought back all of our UBS-brokered ARS.
Europe Receivables Financing Facility A subsidiary of BestBuy Europe has a 350 ($548) receivables financing facility (the "ERF") with a syndication of banks, including Barclays Bank PLC acting as administrative agent, to finance the working capital needs of BestBuy Europe. The ERF is secured by certain mobile phone network operator receivables of subsidiaries of BestBuy Europe, which are included within receivables in our consolidated balance sheets. Availability on the ERF is based on a percentage of the available acceptable receivables, as defined in the ERF agreement, and was 323 ($506) at February26, 2011. Of the amount available, we had drawn 291 ($455) at February26, 2011. The ERF expires on July3, 2012.
Interest rates under the ERF are variable, based on the three-month LIBOR plus a margin of 3.0%, with a commitment fee of 1.5% on unused available capacity. The ERF also required an initial commitment fee of 2.75%.
The ERF is not guaranteed by BestBuy Co., Inc., or any of our subsidiaries, nor does it provide for any recourse to BestBuy Co.,Inc. The ERF contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict or prohibit BestBuy Europe's ability to incur certain types or amounts of indebtedness, incur additional encumbrances on its receivables, make material changes in the nature of its business, dispose of material assets, make guarantees, or engage in a change in control transaction. The ERF also contains covenants that require BestBuy Europe to comply with a maximum annual leverage ratio, a minimum annual interest coverage ratio and a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio.
Europe Revolving Credit Facility In connection with a 475 revolving credit facility available to BestBuy Europe, with CPW as lender, BestBuy Co., Inc. was named as guarantor, for up to 50% of the amount outstanding. Concurrent with entering into the ERF, we amended 101 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted the revolving credit facility to decrease the amount available by the amount available under the ERF. The corresponding guarantee by BestBuy Co., Inc. was similarly reduced.
In fiscal 2011, BestBuy Europe entered into a new 125 ($196) revolving credit facility (the "New RCF") with one of our subsidiaries and Carphone Warehouse as lenders. Concurrent with the execution of the New RCF agreement, the 475 revolving credit facility was terminated. Amounts borrowed under the New RCF are provided for equally by us via intercompany transactions and by Carphone Warehouse. The New RCF expires in March 2013. The New RCF is not guaranteed by BestBuy Co., Inc., or any of our subsidiaries, nor does it provide for any recourse to BestBuy Co., Inc. The full amount available under the New RCF, or 125 ($196), was borrowed by BestBuy Europe at February26, 2011, for which Carphone Warehouse's proportionate and equal share of 63 ($98) was outstanding.
Interest rates under the New RCF are variable, based on the applicable LIBOR plus a margin of 3.0%. A commitment fee of 1.5% on unused available capacity also applies.
Canada Revolving Demand Facility We have a $51 revolving demand facility available to our Canada operations including an additional seasonal facility of $51 that is available from September through December of each year. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at February26, 2011. There is no set expiration date for the facility. All borrowings under the facility are made available at the sole discretion of the lender and are payable on demand. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at rates specified in the credit agreement for the facility. Borrowings are secured by a guarantee of BestBuy Co., Inc.
China Revolving Demand Facilities We have $159 in revolving demand facilities available to our China operations, of which $4 was outstanding at February26, 2011. The facilities are renewed annually with the respective banks. All borrowings under these facilities bear interest at rates specified in the related credit agreements, are made available at the sole discretion of the respective lenders and are payable on demand. Certain of these facilities are secured by a guarantee of BestBuy Co., Inc.
Long-Term Debt Long-term debt consisted of the following: February26, 2011 February27, 2010 2013 Notes $ 500 $ 500 Convertible debentures 402 402 Financing lease obligations, due 2011 to 2025, interest rates ranging from 3.0% to 8.1% 170 186 Capital lease obligations, due 2011 to 2035, interest rates ranging from 2.1% to 8.3% 79 49 Other debt, due 2018 to 2022, interest rates ranging from 2.6% to 6.7% 1 2 Total long-term debt $ 1,152 $ 1,139 Less: current portion (1) (441 ) (35 ) Total long-term debt, less current portion $ 711 $ 1,104 (1) Since holders of our convertible debentures may require us to purchase all or a portion of the debentures on January15, 2012, we have classified the $402 for such debentures in the current portion of long-term debt at February26, 2011.
2013 Notes In June 2008, we sold $500 principal amount of notes due July15, 2013 (the "2013 Notes"). The 2013 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% per year, payable semi-annually on January15 and July15 of each year, beginning 102 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted January15, 2009. The interest payable on the 2013 Notes is subject to adjustment if either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard& Poor's Ratings Services downgrades the rating assigned to the 2013 Notes to below investment grade. Net proceeds from the sale of the 2013 Notes were $496, after an initial issuance discount of $1 and other transaction costs.
We may redeem some or all of the 2013 Notes at any time, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2013 Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and an applicable make-whole amount as described in the indenture relating to the 2013 Notes.
The 2013 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The 2013 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our North American subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens, enter into sale and lease-back transactions and, in the case of such subsidiaries, incur unsecured debt.
Convertible Debentures In January 2002, we sold convertible subordinated debentures having an aggregate principal amount of $402. The proceeds from the offering, net of $6 in offering expenses, were $396. On January15, 2007, the debentures became callable at par, at our option, for cash. The debentures mature in 2022.
Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the debentures on January15, 2012, and again on January15, 2017 if not previously redeemed, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. We have the option to settle the purchase price in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. Since holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the debentures on January15, 2012, we classified the debentures in the current portion of long-term debt at February26, 2011.
The debentures become convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 21.7391shares per one thousand dollars principal amount of debentures, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $46.00 per share, if the closing price of our common stock exceeds a specified price for 20 consecutive trading days in a 30-trading day period preceding the date of conversion, if our credit rating falls below specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur. The debentures were not convertible at February26, 2011, and have not been convertible through April20, 2011.
The debentures have an interest rate of 2.25% per annum. The interest rate may be reset, but not below 2.25% or above 3.25%, on July15, 2011, and July15, 2016. One of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the debentures.
Other The fair value of long-term debt approximated $1,210 at both February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, based primarily on the ask prices quoted from external sources, compared to carrying values of $1,152 and $1,139, respectively.
103 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted At February26, 2011, the future maturities of long-term debt, including capitalized leases, consisted of the following: Fiscal Year 2012 (1) $ 441 2013 37 2014 537 2015 36 2016 29 Thereafter 72 Total long-term debt $ 1,152 (1) Holders of our convertible debentures may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January15, 2012. The table above assumes that all holders exercise their redemption right on that date.
7.Derivative Instruments We manage our economic and transaction exposure to certain market-based risks through the use of foreign currency derivative instruments. Our objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
We record all foreign currency derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively when electing to apply hedge accounting treatment. We formally document all hedging relationships at inception for all derivative hedges and the underlying hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions. In addition, we have derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments. We have no derivatives that have credit risk-related contingent features, and we mitigate our credit risk by engaging with major financial institutions as our counterparties.
Cash Flow Hedges We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain revenue streams denominated in non-functional currencies. The contracts have terms of up to two years. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedge as a component of other comprehensive income, and it is subsequently reclassified into net earnings in the period in which the hedged transaction affects net earnings or the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring. We discontinued certain cash flow hedges and reclassified $5 into net earnings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, as the forecasted transactions were no longer probable of occurring. We report the ineffective portion, if any, of the gain or loss in net earnings.
Net Investment Hedges Previously, we entered into foreign exchange swap contracts to hedge against the effect of euro and Swiss franc exchange rate fluctuations on net investments of certain foreign operations. For a net investment hedge, we recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative as a component of foreign currency translation within other comprehensive income to offset a portion of the change in the translated value of the net investment being hedged, until the investment was sold or liquidated. During fiscal 2011, we discontinued this hedging strategy and no longer have contracts that hedge net investments of foreign operations.
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include foreign exchange forward contracts used to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to recognized receivable and payable balances denominated in 104 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted non-functional currencies and on certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in non-functional currencies. The contracts have terms of up to six months. These derivative instruments are not designated in hedging relationships and, therefore, we record gains and losses on these contracts directly in net earnings.

We have not granted incentive stock options under the Omnibus Plan. Under the terms of the Omnibus Plan, awards may be granted to our employees, officers, advisors, consultants and directors. Awards issued under the Omnibus Plan vest as determined by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors at the time of grant. At February26, 2011, a total of 3.4million shares were available for future grants under the Omnibus Plan.
Upon adoption and approval of the Omnibus Plan, all of our previous equity incentive compensation plans were terminated. However, existing awards under those plans continued to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedule and will expire at the end of their original term.
Our outstanding stock options have a 10-year term. Outstanding stock options issued to employees generally vest over a four-year period, and outstanding stock options issued to directors vest immediately upon grant. Share awards vest based either upon attainment of established goals or upon continued employment ("time-based"). Outstanding share awards that are not time-based typically vest at the end of a three-year incentive period based either upon our total shareholder return ("TSR") compared to the TSR of companies that comprise Standard& Poor's 500 Index or growth in our common stock price ("market-based"), or upon the achievement of company or personal performance goals ("performance-based"). We have time-based share awards that vest in their entirety at the end of three- and four-year periods and time-based share awards where 25% of the award vests on the date of grant and 25% vests on each of the three anniversary dates thereafter.
Our 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan permitted and our 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan permits our employees to purchase our common stock at 85% of the market price of the stock at the beginning or at the end of a semi-annual purchase period, whichever is less.
Stock-based compensation expense was as follows in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Stock options $ 90 $ 85 $ 77 Share awards Market-based 4 8 13 Performance-based (1 ) 1 2 Time-based 16 10 4 Employee stock purchase plans 12 14 14 Total $ 121 $ 118 $ 110 106 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted Stock Options Stock option activity was as follows in fiscal 2011: Stock Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price per Share Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding at February27, 2010 36,588,000 $ 38.18 Granted 4,924,000 38.85 Exercised (4,355,000 ) 30.83 Forfeited/Canceled (1,570,000 ) 42.88 Outstanding at February26, 2011 35,587,000 $ 38.97 6.4 $ 41 Vested or expected to vest at February26, 2011 32,438,000 $ 39.21 6.2 $ 39 Exercisable at February26, 2011 21,717,000 $ 40.14 5.1 $ 30 The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $11.97, $12.69 and $13.04, respectively, per share. The aggregate intrinsic value of our stock options (the amount by which the market price of the stock on the date of exercise exceeded the exercise price of the option) exercised during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, was $52, $28 and $26, respectively. At February26, 2011, there was $127 of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7years.
Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $134, $96 and $34 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The actual income tax benefit realized from stock option exercises was $19, $10 and $7, in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, we estimated the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using a lattice model with the following assumptions: Valuation Assumptions (1) 2011 2010 2009 Risk-free interest rate (2) 0.2%- 3.9% 0.2%- 3.8% 0.9%- 4.0% Expected dividend yield 1.5% 1.6% 1.6% Expected stock price volatility (3) 36% 42% 45% Expected life of stock options (in years) (4) 6.1 6.1 6.1 (1) Forfeitures are estimated using historical experience and projected employee turnover.
(2) Based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of our stock options.
(3) We use an outside valuation advisor to assist us in projecting expected stock price volatility. We consider both the historical volatility of our stock price as well as implied volatilities from exchange-traded options on our stock.
(4) We estimate the expected life of stock options based upon historical experience.
107 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted Market-Based Share Awards The fair value of market-based share awards is determined based on generally accepted valuation techniques and the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant. A summary of the status of our nonvested market-based share awards at February26, 2011, and changes during fiscal 2011, is as follows: Market-Based Share Awards Shares Weighted- Average Fair Value per Share Outstanding at February27, 2010 633,000 $ 42.97 Granted   Vested (200,000 ) 38.65 Forfeited/Canceled (240,000 ) 39.14 Outstanding at February26, 2011 193,000 $ 52.19 We recognize expense for market-based share awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (or to an employee's eligible retirement date, if earlier). At February26, 2011, compensation expense had been fully recognized.
Performance-Based Share Awards The fair value of performance-based share awards is determined based on the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant. A summary of the status of our nonvested performance-based share awards at February26, 2011, and changes during fiscal 2011, is as follows: Performance-Based Share Awards Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Outstanding at February27, 2010 2,343,000 $ 42.11 Granted 6,000 44.20 Vested (64,000 ) 54.13 Forfeited/Canceled (106,000 ) 44.58 Outstanding at February26, 2011 2,179,000 $ 41.64 At February26, 2011, there was no compensation expense related to nonvested performance-based share awards that we expect to recognize.
108 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted Time-Based Share Awards The fair value of time-based share awards is determined based on the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant. A summary of the status of our nonvested time-based share awards at February26, 2011, and changes during fiscal 2011, is as follows: Time-Based Share Awards Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Outstanding at February27, 2010 1,332,000 $ 34.06 Granted 1,321,000 38.40 Vested (380,000 ) 34.17 Forfeited/Canceled (102,000 ) 35.93 Outstanding at February26, 2011 2,171,000 $ 36.60 At February26, 2011, there was $53 of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested time-based share awards that we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 3.0years.
Employee Stock Purchase Plans In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, we estimated the fair value of stock-based compensation expense associated with our employee stock purchase plans on the purchase date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model, with the following assumptions: Valuation Assumptions 2011 2010 2009 Risk-free interest rate (1) 0.2% 0.3% 1.3% Expected dividend yield 1.4% 1.5% 1.4% Expected stock price volatility (2) 29% 53% 42% Expected life of employee stock purchase plan options (in months) (3) 6 6 6 (1) Based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of employee stock purchase plan shares.
(2) We consider both the historical volatility of our stock price as well as implied volatilities from exchange-traded options on our stock.
(3) Based on semi-annual purchase period.
In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, 1.3million, 1.2million and 1.4million shares, respectively, were purchased through our employee stock purchase plans. The weighted-average fair values of shares purchased pursuant to the plans during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, were $9.54, $11.34 and $10.32, respectively. At February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, plan participants had accumulated $19 and $18, respectively, to purchase our common stock pursuant to these plans.
Earnings per Share We compute our basic earnings per share based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, and our diluted earnings per share based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding had the potentially dilutive common shares been issued. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock include stock options, nonvested share awards and shares issuable under our employee stock purchase plan, as well as common shares that would have resulted from the assumed conversion of our convertible debentures (see Note6, Debt ). Since the potentially dilutive shares related to the convertible debentures are included in the computation, the related interest expense, net of tax, is added back to net earnings, as the interest would not have been paid if the convertible debentures had been converted to common stock. Nonvested market-based share 109 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted awards and nonvested performance-based share awards are included in the average diluted shares outstanding each period if established market or performance criteria have been met at the end of the respective periods.
At February26, 2011, options to purchase 35.6million shares of common stock were outstanding as follows (shares in millions): Exercisable Unexercisable Total Shares % Weighted- Average Price per Share Shares % Weighted- Average Price per Share Shares % Weighted- Average Price per Share In-the-money 9.0 41 $ 30.61 8.5 61 $ 33.59 17.5 49 $ 32.06 Out-of-the-money 12.7 59 46.83 5.4 39 42.78 18.1 51 45.63 Total 21.7 100 $ 40.14 13.9 100 $ 37.13 35.6 100 $ 38.97 The computation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes the out-of-the-money stock options because such outstanding options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive (i.e., including such options would result in higher earnings per share).
The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Numerator: Net earnings attributable to BestBuy Co., Inc., basic $ 1,277 $ 1,317 $ 1,003 Adjustment for assumed dilution: Interest on convertible debentures due in 2022, net of tax 6 6 6 Net earnings attributable to BestBuy Co., Inc., diluted $ 1,283 $ 1,323 $ 1,009 Denominator (in millions): Weighted-average common shares outstanding 406.1 416.8 412.5 Effect of potentially dilutive securities: Shares from assumed conversion of convertible debentures 8.8 8.8 8.8 Stock options and other 1.6 1.9 1.6 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, assuming dilution 416.5 427.5 422.9 Net earnings per share attributable to BestBuy Co., Inc.
Basic $ 3.14 $ 3.16 $ 2.43 Diluted $ 3.08 $ 3.10 $ 2.39 Repurchase of Common Stock In June 2007, our Board of Directors authorized up to $5,500 in share repurchases, a program that terminated and replaced our prior $1,500 share repurchase program authorized in June 2006. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the June 2007 share repurchase program. At February26, 2011, $1,307 remains available for future purchases under the June 2007 share repurchase program. Repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares.
110 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted Open Market Repurchases The following table presents open market share repurchases in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 (shares in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Total number of shares repurchased 32.6   Total cost of shares repurchased $ 1,193 $  $  Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is computed as net earnings plus certain other items that are recorded directly to shareholders' equity. In addition to net earnings, the significant components of comprehensive income include foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale marketable equity securities and on derivative instruments. Foreign currency translation adjustments do not include a provision for income tax expense when earnings from foreign operations are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.
Comprehensive income attributable to BestBuy Co., Inc. was $1,410, $1,674 and $184 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, were as follows: February26, 2011 February27, 2010 Foreign currency translation $ 102 $ 26 Unrealized gains on available-for-sale investments 72 14 Unrealized losses on derivative instruments (cash flow hedges) (1 )  Total $ 173 $ 40 9.Leases The composition of net rent expense for all operating leases, including leases of property and equipment, was as follows in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Minimum rentals $ 1,176 $ 1,145 $ 962 Contingent rentals 2 2 1 Total rent expense 1,178 1,147 963 Less: sublease income (19 ) (20 ) (23 ) Net rent expense $ 1,159 $ 1,127 $ 940 111 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted The future minimum lease payments under our capital, financing and operating leases by fiscal year (not including contingent rentals) at February26, 2011, were as follows: Fiscal Year Capital Leases Financing Leases Operating Leases 2012 $ 18 $ 34 $ 1,208 2013 16 32 1,166 2014 16 30 1,079 2015 14 29 992 2016 8 25 872 Thereafter 25 60 2,930 Subtotal 97 210 $ 8,247 Less: imputed interest (18 ) (40 ) Present value $ 79 $ 170 Total minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rent income of approximately $124 due under future noncancelable subleases.
During fiscal 2011 and 2010, we entered into agreements totaling $52 and $9, respectively, related to various IT equipment leases.
10.Benefit Plans We sponsor retirement savings plans for employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Participants may choose from various investment options including a fund comprised of our company stock. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation annually as defined by the plan document, subject to Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") limitations. We match 100% of the first 3% of participating employees' contributions and 50% of the next 2%. Employer contributions vest immediately. The total employer contributions were $69, $62 and $58 in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
We have a non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for highly compensated employees and members of our Board of Directors. Amounts contributed and deferred under our deferred compensation plan are credited or charged with the performance of investment options offered under the plan and elected by the participants. In the event of bankruptcy, the assets of the plan are available to satisfy the claims of general creditors. The liability for compensation deferred under the plan was $64 and $61 at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, respectively, and is included in long-term liabilities. We manage the risk of changes in the fair value of the liability for deferred compensation by electing to match our liability under the plan with investment vehicles that offset a substantial portion of our exposure. The cash value of the investment vehicles, which includes funding for future deferrals, was $83 and $75 at February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, respectively, and is included in other assets. Both the asset and the liability are carried at fair value.

Earnings before income tax expense and equity in income of affiliates by jurisdiction was as follows in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 United States $ 1,629 $ 1,870 $ 1,540 Outside the United States 449 325 160 Earnings before income tax expense and equity in income of affiliates $ 2,078 $ 2,195 $ 1,700 Income tax expense was comprised of the following in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Current: Federal $ 689 $ 666 $ 573 State 67 113 78 Foreign 92 53 66 848 832 717 Deferred: Federal (113 ) (13 ) (7 ) State (2 ) (11 ) 1 Foreign (19 ) (6 ) (37 ) (134 ) (30 ) (43 ) Income tax expense $ 714 $ 802 $ 674 113 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted Deferred taxes are the result of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities were comprised of the following: February26, 2011 February27, 2010 Accrued property expenses $ 154 $ 149 Other accrued expenses 122 126 Deferred revenue 141 150 Compensation and benefits 86 64 Stock-based compensation 137 125 Net operating loss carryforwards 247 211 Other 181 60 Total deferred tax assets 1,068 885 Valuation allowance (212 ) (151 ) Total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance 856 734 Property and equipment (316 ) (381 ) Convertible debt (79 ) (71 ) Goodwill and intangibles (123 ) (125 ) Other (47 ) (31 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (565 ) (608 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 291 $ 126 Deferred tax assets and liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows: February26, 2011 February27, 2010 Other current assets $ 261 $ 244 Other assets 98 19 Other long-term liabilities (68 ) (137 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 291 $ 126 At February26, 2011, we had total net operating loss carryforwards from international operations of $218, of which $93 will expire in various years through 2021 and the remaining amounts have no expiration. Additionally, we had acquired U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $29 which expire between 2025 and 2028, and U.S. federal foreign tax credits of $58 which expire between 2015 and 2021.
At February26, 2011, a valuation allowance of $212 had been established against certain international net operating loss carryforwards and other international deferred tax assets. The $61 increase from February27, 2010, is primarily due to valuation allowances that arose in fiscal 2011.
We have not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to foreign operations that have been considered to be reinvested indefinitely. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and were $1,764 at February26, 2011. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested.
114 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2011 and 2010: Balance at February28, 2009 $ 349 Gross increases related to prior period tax positions 96 Gross decreases related to prior period tax positions (72 ) Gross increases related to current period tax positions 50 Settlements with taxing authorities (24 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (6 ) Balance at February27, 2010 $ 393 Gross increases related to prior period tax positions 36 Gross decreases related to prior period tax positions (90 ) Gross increases related to current period tax positions 40 Settlements with taxing authorities  Lapse of statute of limitations (20 ) Balance at February26, 2011 $ 359 At February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, $233 and $195, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized.
We recognize interest and penalties (not included in the "unrecognized tax benefits" above), as well as interest received from favorable tax settlements, as components of income tax expense. Interest expense of $1 and penalties benefit of $4 were recognized as a component of income tax expense in fiscal 2011. At February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, we had accrued interest of $84 and $78, respectively, along with accrued penalties of $0 and $4 at February26, 2011 and February27, 2010, respectively.
We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2003.
Because existing tax positions will continue to generate increased liabilities for us for unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12months, and since we are routinely under audit by various taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12months. An estimate of the amount or range of such change cannot be made at this time. However, we do not expect the change, if any, to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations within the next 12months.
12.Segment and Geographic Information Segment Information We have organized our operations into two segments: Domestic and International. These segments are the primary areas of measurement and decision-making by our chief operating decision maker. The Domestic reportable segment is comprised of all operations within the U.S. and its territories. The International reportable segment is comprised of all operations outside the U.S. and its territories. We rely on an internal management reporting process that provides segment information to the operating income level for purposes of making financial decisions and allocating resources. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .

BestBuy Co., Inc.

This federal court action alleges that we discriminate against women and minority individuals on the basis of gender, race, color and/or national origin in our stores with respect to our employment policies and practices. The action seeks an end to alleged discriminatory policies and practices, an award of back and front pay, punitive damages and injunctive relief, including rightful place relief for all class members. The plaintiffs have filed a class certification motion which we have opposed. All proceedings have been stayed pending a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Dukes, et al. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
, a gender discrimination class action lawsuit.
In February 2011, a purported class action lawsuit captioned, IBEW Local 98 Pension Fund, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. BestBuy Co., Inc., et al.
, was filed against us and certain of our executive officers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. This federal court action alleges, among other things, that we and those officers violated Sections10(b) and 20A of the Exchange Act and Rule10b-5 under the Exchange Act in connection with press releases and other statements relating to our fiscal 2011 earnings guidance that had been made available to the public. Additionally, in March 2011, a similar purported class action was filed by a single shareholder, Rene LeBlanc, against us and certain of our executive officers in the same court.
The plaintiffs in the above actions seek damages, including interest, equitable relief and reimbursement of the costs and expenses they incurred in the lawsuits. We believe the above allegations are without merit, and we intend to defend these actions vigorously. Based on our assessment of the facts underlying the claims in the above actions, their respective procedural litigation history (including the status of class certification in the Holloway lawsuit), and the degree to which we intend to defend our company in these matters, we are unable to provide meaningful quantification of how the final resolution of these claims may impact our future consolidated financial position or results of operations.
We are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of conducting business. We believe the amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. The resolution of those other proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
Commitments We engage Accenture LLP ("Accenture") to assist us with improving our operational capabilities and reducing our costs in the information systems, procurement and human resources areas. We expect our future contractual obligations to Accenture to range from $165 to $215 per year through 2016, the end of the periods under contract.
We had outstanding letters of credit and bankers' acceptances for purchase obligations with an aggregate fair value of $516 at February26, 2011.
At February26, 2011, we had commitments for the purchase and construction of facilities valued at approximately $32. Also, at February26, 2011, we had entered into lease commitments for land and buildings for 27 future locations. These lease commitments with real estate developers provide for minimum rentals ranging from 3to 20years, which if consummated based on current cost estimates, will approximate $15 annually over the initial lease terms. These minimum rentals are reported in the future minimum lease payments included in Note9, Leases .
14.Sale of Business During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we completed the sale of our Speakeasy business to Covad Communications Group, Inc. ("Covad"). Prior to this sale, Covad had merged with Megapath Inc. The three combined businesses operate 118 Table of Contents $ in millions, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted under the Megapath name. Upon closing of the Speakeasy sale, we received cash consideration and a minority equity interest in the combined company. Based upon the fair value of the consideration received and the carrying value of Speakeasy at closing, we recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $7 in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, which is included within investment income and other in our consolidated statements of earnings.
15.Related Party Transactions BestBuy Europe had the following related party transactions and balances with CPW and Carphone Warehouse in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Revenue earned (primarily commission revenue and fees for information technology services provided to CPW and Carphone Warehouse) $ 6 $ 63 $ 12 SG&A incurred (primarily for rent and other payroll-related costs paid to CPW and Carphone Warehouse) 8 6 29 Interest expense incurred on credit facility with CPW and Carphone Warehouse as lender 1 4 15 Accounts payable to CPW and Carphone Warehouse at the end of the fiscal year  4 108 Accounts receivable from CPW and Carphone Warehouse at the end of the fiscal year 2 31 60 Balance outstanding on credit facility from CPW and Carphone Warehouse at the end of the fiscal year (see Note6, Debt ) 98 206 584 16.Subsequent Event In March 2011, we sold $350 principal amount of notes due March15, 2016 (the "2016 Notes") and $650 principal amount of notes due March15, 2021 (the "2021 Notes", and together with the 2016 Notes, the "Notes"). The 2016 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.75% per year, while the 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on March15 and September15 of each year, beginning September15, 2011. The Notes were issued at a slight discount to par, which when coupled with underwriting discounts of $6, resulted in net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of $990.
We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed and (ii)the sum of the present values of each remaining scheduled payment of principal and interest on the Notes redeemed discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Notes to the redemption date as described in the indenture (including the supplemental indenture) relating to the Notes. Furthermore, if a change of control triggering event occurs, unless we have previously exercised our option to redeem the Notes, we will be required to offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date.
The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our North American subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens or to enter into sale and lease-back transactions.

Our convertible debentures, which had an aggregate principal balance and carrying amount of $402 at February26, 2011, are jointly and severally guaranteed by our 100%-owned indirect subsidiary BestBuy Stores, L.P. ("Guarantor Subsidiary"). Investments in subsidiaries of BestBuy Stores, L.P., which have not guaranteed the convertible debentures ("Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries"), are required to be presented under the equity method, even though all such subsidiaries meet the requirements to be consolidated under GAAP.
Set forth below are condensed consolidating financial statements presenting the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of (i)BestBuy Co., Inc., (ii)the Guarantor Subsidiary, (iii)the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, and (iv)the eliminations necessary to arrive at consolidated information for our company. The statement of earnings eliminations relate primarily to the sale of inventory from a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary to the Guarantor Subsidiary. The balance sheet eliminations relate primarily to the elimination of intercompany profit in inventory held by the Guarantor Subsidiary and consolidating entries to eliminate intercompany receivables, payables and subsidiary investment accounts.
We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Income taxes are allocated in accordance with our tax allocation agreement. U.S. affiliates receive no tax benefit for taxable losses, but are allocated taxes at the required effective income tax rate if they have taxable income.
The following tables present condensed consolidating balance sheets as of February26, 2011, and February27, 2010, and condensed consolidating statements of earnings and cash flows for the fiscal years ended February26, 2011, February27, 2010, and February28, 2009, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements herein.

Revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers or dealers is not included within our comparable store sales calculation. Relocated, remodeled and expanded stores are excluded from our comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are included in our comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The portion of our calculation of the comparable store sales percentage change attributable to our International segment excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods.
(2) Includes $222 of restructuring charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter related to measures we took to restructure our businesses.
(3) The sum of our quarterly diluted earnings per share does not equal our annual diluted earnings per share due to the impact of the timing of the repurchases of common stock and stock option exercises on quarterly and annual weighted-average shares outstanding.

Item9A. Controls and Procedures.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We have established a Disclosure Committee, consisting of certain members of management, to assist in this evaluation. Our Disclosure Committee meets on a quarterly basis and more often if necessary.
