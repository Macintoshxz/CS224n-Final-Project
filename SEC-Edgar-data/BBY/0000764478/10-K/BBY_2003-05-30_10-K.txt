2 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview We are North Americas  No. 1 specialty retailer of consumer electronics, personal computers,  entertainment software and appliances with revenues for our fiscal year ended  March 2, 2002, of $19.6 billion. We operate retail stores and commercial Web  sites under the brand names Best Buy (BestBuy.com), Media Play (MediaPlay.com),  On Cue (OnCue.com), Sam Goody (SamGoody.com), Suncoast (Suncoast.com), Magnolia  Hi-Fi (MagnoliaHiFi.com) and Future Shop (FutureShop.ca).
We began in 1966 as an  audio components retailer, and in the early 1980s, with the introduction of the  videocassette recorder, expanded into video products. In 1983, we revised our  marketing strategy and began using mass-merchandising techniques, which  included offering a wider variety of products and operating stores under a  superstore concept. In 1989, we dramatically changed our method of retailing  by introducing a self-service, noncommissioned, discountstyle store  concept designed to give the customer more control over the purchasing process.  The Best Buy store concept, now employed in 481 stores across the United  States, has continued to evolve to include more interactive displays and, for  certain products, a higher level of customer service, with the latest version  including a more effective labor model and improved merchandising. In fiscal  2000, we introduced a smallmarket Best Buy store concept that serves  communities of generally less than 200,000 people and offers merchandise in the  same product categories as larger stores, with a product assortment tailored to  each respective community. In fiscal 2001, we re-launched Best Buy stores  online shopping site, BestBuy.com. Our clicks-and-mortar strategy is designed  to empower consumers to research and purchase products seamlessly across the  Best Buy retail environment  online or in retail stores. The online site  offers products in all of Best Buy stores principal product categories except  appliances.
In the fourth quarter of  fiscal 2001, we acquired the common stock of Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc. for $88  million in cash, including transaction costs, and the common stock of Musicland  Stores Corporation for $425 million, including transaction costs, plus  long-term debt valued at $271 million. Magnolia Hi-Fi is a Seattle-based,  high-end retailer of audio and video products that operates 13 stores in  Washington, Oregon and California. We believe Magnolia Hi-Fi has expansion  potential of up to 150 stores nationwide. However, prior to pursuing an  aggressive growth strategy, we believe we must refine the store concept and  broaden the scope of products and services currently offered at Magnolia Hi-Fi.  Musicland is one of the largest national retailers of movies, prerecorded  music, video games and other entertainmentrelated products with 1,321  stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico  and the Virgin Islands. Our intention is to enhance the Musicland business by  improving the customer experience and diversifying the revenue mix, thereby  boosting sales productivity and profitability. We also view Musiclands  small-market stores as an attractive growth opportunity. In the third quarter  of fiscal 2002, we acquired the common stock of Future Shop Ltd. for $368  million, net of cash acquired, including transaction costs. Future Shop, which  currently operates 95 stores, is Canadas largest consumer electronics retailer  and offers product categories similar to that at Best Buy stores. We acquired  Future Shop to further our expansion plans, leverage our expertise in consumer  electronics retailing and increase shareholder value. The acquisition marked  our initial expansion into international operations. Additional information  regarding our acquisitions is included in note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements on page 41 of our Annual Report, contained in exhibit 13.1  to this report, and is incorporated herein by reference.
Our vision is to make  life fun and easy. Our business strategy is to bring technology and consumers  together in a retail environment that focuses on educating consumers on the  features and benefits of technology and entertainment while maximizing overall  profitability. We believe our stores offer consumers meaningful advantages in  store environment, product value, selection and service, all of which further  our objective of achieving a significant market share in the markets we serve.  The acquisitions of Musicland, Magnolia Hi-Fi and Future Shop give us access to  new distribution channels, more customer visits and the ability to leverage  Best Buy stores core competencies with their operations. We also expect  additional benefits from the cross merchandising of products and information sharing  across our distribution channels.
Operating  Segments We  currently operate three segments: Best Buy, Musicland and International. Best  Buy is primarily a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home office  equipment, entertainment software and appliances. Also included in the Best Buy  segment is Seattle-based Magnolia Hi-Fi, a high-end retailer of audio and video  products. The Musicland segment is primarily a mall-based retailer of movies,  prerecorded music, video games and other entertainment-related products. The  International segment consists of Future Shop, a specialty retailer of consumer  electronics, home office equipment, entertainment software and appliances with  operations in Canada.

Best  Buy Stores Overview At the end of fiscal  2002, we operated 481 Best Buy stores in 44 states. The stores average 44,900  retail square feet and produce average annual sales of approximately  $38million. Best Buy stores collectively represent 21.6million  retail square feet, or 67% of our total retail square footage. During fiscal  2002, we launched our latest store concept, which features flexible  architecture, improved merchandising, faster checkout, better product  adjacencies and a more efficient labor model. Most new Best Buy stores opened  in fiscal 2003 are expected to incorporate the features of this latest store  format.

Consumer electronics, Best Buys largest category, based on revenues,  consists of video and audio equipment. Video products include television sets,  DVD players, cameras, camcorders, VCRs and digital broadcast satellite systems.  Audio products include car stereos, portable audio equipment, home theater  audio systems, audio components, shelf systems and speakers. The home office  category includes desktop and notebook computers and related peripheral  equipment, telephones, wireless communication devices and personal digital  assistants. Entertainment software products include compact discs, video game  hardware and software, DVD and VHS movies, and computer software. The appliance  category includes major appliances such as washers, dryers, ranges,  refrigerators, freezers and dishwashers, as well as vacuums, microwaves and  housewares. The other product category includes extended service contracts,  blank recording media, furniture, and other miscellaneous products such as  batteries, business cases and storage products.
The following table presents Best Buy stores sales, by category, as a  percentage of total Best Buy stores sales: 4 Product    Category Percentage    of Total Sales Fiscal 2002 Percentage    of Total Sales Fiscal 2001 Percentage    of Total Sales Fiscal 2000 Consumer    Electronics 33 % 33 % 30 % Home Office 31 % 34 % 35 % Entertainment    Software 22 % 19 % 19 % Appliances 6 % 7 % 8 % Other 8 % 7 % 8 % Operations Best Buy stores follow  standardized and detailed operating procedures called Standard Operating  Platform (SOP). The SOP includes procedures for inventory management,  transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, product sales  and merchandise display.
Best Buy store operations  are organized into three divisions. Each division is divided into regions and  is under the supervision of a senior vice president who oversees store  performance through regional vice presidents. Regional vice presidents have  responsibility for a number of districts within their respective region.  District managers monitor store operations closely and meet regularly with  store managers to discuss merchandising, new product introductions, sales  promotions, customer loyalty programs, employee satisfaction surveys and store  operating performance. Similar meetings are conducted at the corporate level  with divisional and regional management. A senior vice president of retail  operations has overall responsibility for retail store processing and  operations including labor management. Each district also has a loss prevention  manager, with product security personnel employed at each store to control  inventory shrinkage. Advertising, merchandise buying and pricing, and inventory  policies for Best Buy stores are centrally controlled.
Best Buy stores are open  seven days a week for approximately 73 hours a week. A store is typically  staffed by one manager and four to five assistant managers. The average staff  ranges from 65 to 150 people, depending on store size and sales volume.
Distribution Generally, merchandise is shipped to Best Buy stores from six  distribution centers located in California, Georgia, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma  and Virginia. Best Buy stores also currently operate a dedicated distribution  center for entertainment software in Minnesota. In fiscal 2004, we expect to  open an additional general distribution center in upstate New York. The  majority of Best Buy stores merchandise, except for major appliances and  large-screen televisions, is shipped directly from manufacturers to a  distribution center. Major appliances and large-screen televisions are shipped  to satellite warehouses in each major market. Best Buy stores are dependent  upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment of most  merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected products and  to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to the  stores from manufacturers and distributors. We believe distribution centers can  most effectively service Best Buy stores within a 600 to 700-mile radius and  that our current distribution centers, and the planned addition of the New York  distribution center in fiscal 2004, will accommodate expansion plans for the  next several years. On average, Best Buy stores receive product shipments two  or three times a week depending on sales volume. Generally, e-commerce  merchandise sales are either picked up at Best Buy retail stores, or fulfilled  through the distribution centers.
Seasonality Similar  to many retailers, Best Buy stores business is seasonal. Revenues and earnings  are typically greater during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes  the holiday selling season.
Competition Best  Buy stores industry is highly competitive. Best Buy stores compete nationally  against other consumer electronics retailers, specialty home office retailers,  mass merchants, home improvement superstores, entertainment software  superstores, electronics boutiques and a growing number of direct-to-consumer  alternatives. Best Buy stores also compete against independent dealers,  regional chain discount stores, wholesale clubs, mail-order and Internet  retailers, video rental stores and other specialty retail stores. Mass  merchandisers continue to increase their assortment of consumer electronics  productsprimarily those that are less complex to sell, install and operate.  Similarly, large home improvement retailers are expanding their assortment of appliances.  In addition, consumers are increasingly downloading entertainment and computer  software directly via the Internet.
We believe Best Buy stores formats and brand  marketing strategies distinguish them from most competitors by positioning Best  Buy retail stores as the destination for new technology and entertainment  products in a fun, informative and no-pressure shopping environment. Best Buy  stores compete by aggressively advertising and emphasizing a broad product  assortment, value pricing and financing alternatives. In addition, we believe  our e-commerce operations, coupled with the knowledgeable sales associates and  service capabilities of Best Buy retail stores, have effectively positioned us  to compete successfully despite an increasingly competitive environment.
Magnolia  Hi-Fi Overview In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, a  retailer of high-end consumer electronics, founded in Seattle in 5 1954. At the end of fiscal 2002, Magnolia Hi-Fi operated 13 stores in  Washington, Oregon and California that average 10,200 retail square feet and  generate average annual sales per store of $7.6million. Collectively,  Magnolia Hi-Fi stores represent approximately 133,000 retail square feet, less  than 1% of our total retail square footage.

Merchandise Magnolia Hi-Fi stores offer audio and video systems for homes,  automobiles and businesses, as well as certain consumer electronics and  wireless communication devices. Magnolia Hi-Fi also operates a state-of-the-art  design center, as well as in-house repair and installation departments. In  addition, Magnolia Hi-Fi provides custom home and car installation services.
The following table presents Magnolia Hi-Fi sales, by category, as a  percentage of total Magnolia Hi-Fi sales: Product    Category Percentage    of Total Sales Fiscal 2002 Consumer    Electronics 80 % Home Office 4 % Accessories 6 % Other 10 % Operations Magnolia Hi-Fi stores are  typically managed by a store manager, an audio/video sales manager and a mobile  electronics sales manager. Most Magnolia HiFi stores are open seven days  a week for 65 to 75 hours a week. Depending on an individual stores volume,  store staffing includes 10 to 28 commissioned sales personnel, two to six  commissioned mobile electronic installers, and two to 11 digital product sales  personnel, cashiers and warehouse personnel. Advertising, merchandise buying  and pricing, and inventory policies for Magnolia Hi-Fi stores are centrally  controlled.
Distribution Magnolia  Hi-Fis merchandise inventory is received and warehoused at its distribution  center in Washington as well as a regional warehouse in California. All  inventory is bar coded and scanned to ensure accurate inventory tracking. In  addition, a computerized inventory replenishment program is used to maintain  optimal inventory levels at each retail store location.
Merchandise is delivered to retail  stores an average of four times each week, via Magnolia Hi-Fis in-house  distribution system.
Seasonality Similar  to many retailers, Magnolia Hi-Fis business is seasonal. Revenues and earnings  are typically greater during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes  the holiday selling season.
Competition Magnolia Hi-Fi competes with a variety of national, regional and local  retailers, including large consumer electronics superstores, mass merchants and  small specialty stores.
Magnolia Hi-Fi has positioned itself between large mass merchants and  high-end specialty boutiques. We believe Magnolia Hi-Fis superior-quality  product offerings, its extensively trained sales staff and its focus on  exceptional customer service both before and after the sale, in combination  with the leveraging of Best Buy stores core competencies, effectively position  Magnolia Hi-Fi to meet current and future competitive challenges.
Musicland Segment Overview Musicland, which was  acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, is one of the largest national  retailers of movies, prerecorded music, video games and other entertainmentrelated  products. Its mall-based stores include the Sam Goody and Suncoast brands. In  addition, Musicland operates small-market On Cue stores and metropolitan, largeformat  Media Play stores. At the end of fiscal 2002, Musicland operated 1,321 stores  in 49 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the  Virgin Islands, with 8.8million total retail square feet, or  approximately 27% of our total retail square footage. Additional information  regarding our 6 Musicland operating  segment is included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of  Operations and Financial Condition beginning on page 24 of our Annual Report,  contained in exhibit 13.1 to this report, and is incorporated herein by  reference. In addition, selected Musicland segment financial data is included  in note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 52  of our Annual Report, contained in exhibit 13.1 to this report and, is  incorporated herein by reference.
The following is a general overview of Musiclands four retail store  concepts: Sam Goody - Sam Goody  stores are predominantly located in malls and average approximately 4,800  retail square feet, although they range in size from 1,000 to 30,000 square  feet. At the end of fiscal 2002, we operated 615 Sam Goody stores in 48 states,  the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin  Islands. The total retail square footage of Sam Goody stores was approximately  3.0million square feet, or 9% of our total retail square footage. Sam  Goody stores average approximately $1.2million in annual revenues per  location.
Suncoast - Suncoast stores are  mall-based and average approximately 2,400 retail square feet. At the end of  fiscal 2002, there were 398 Suncoast stores in 47 states, the District of  Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The total retail square footage  of Suncoast stores was approximately 1.0million square feet, or 3% of our  total retail square footage. Suncoast stores average approximately  $1.1million in annual revenues per location.
On Cue - On Cue  stores are located in small or rural cities, generally with populations of  10,000 to 30,000, and average approximately 6,100 retail square feet. At the  end of fiscal 2002, we operated 232 On Cue stores in 32 states with total  retail square footage of approximately 1.4million square feet, or 4% of  our total retail square footage. On Cue stores average approximately $700,000  in annual revenues per location. In fiscal 2003, we announced plans to begin  changing the name of On Cue stores to the Sam Goody name as the result of brand  recognition research we conducted during fiscal 2002.
Media Play - Media  Play is a superstore format retailer located in metropolitan markets. Media  Play stores are operated primarily in freestanding and strip mall locations in  urban and suburban areas and average approximately 45,000 retail square feet.  At the end of fiscal 2002, we operated 76 Media Play stores in 19 states with  total retail square footage of approximately 3.4million, or 11% of our  total retail square footage. Media Play stores average approximately  $7.3million in annual revenues per location.

Merchandise The following is an overview of the merchandise offered at each of  Musiclands four retail store concepts: Sam Goody - Sam  Goody stores generally offer music entertainment products such as compact  discs, DVDs, audiocassettes, music and movie videos, sheet music,  music-inspired apparel, posters and other music-related accessories. In fiscal  2002, we launched a new mix of products in Sam Goody stores. We doubled the  assortment of DVD movies and introduced video gaming, categories that carry  lower profit margins but are expected to generate higher sales growth. We also  expanded our assortment of hardware products that play music and movies, a  natural extension of Sam Goodys principal product offerings.
Suncoast - Suncoast  stores feature newly released and classic movies, special interest videos and  video recordings of popular TV shows. Complementary products include apparel,  posters and other products inspired by new releases, as well as blank  videotapes, storage cases and other video-related accessories.
On Cue - On  Cue stores provide a wide assortment of entertainment products including  movies, music, books, computer software, electronics, video games and related  products.
Media Play - Media  Play offers a large assortment of entertainment products including movies,  music, books, computer software, video games, electronics, musical instruments  and toys.
The following table presents Musicland sales, by category, as a  percentage of total Musicland sales: 7 Product    Category Percentage    of Total Sales Fiscal 2002 Music 41 % Movies 35 % Gaming 6 % Other 18 % Operations Sam Goody, Suncoast and  On Cue stores are typically managed by a store manager and an assistant  manager. Media Play stores are typically managed by a general manager, an  assistant general manager and three to five department managers. Most Musicland  stores are open from 65 to 80hours per week, seven days a week, depending  on mall hours. Store staffing levels fluctuate with the size of the store and  anticipated sales volume. Advertising, merchandise buying and pricing, and  inventory policies for Musicland stores are centrally controlled.
Distribution The majority of  Musiclands inventory is shipped from its distribution center located in  Indiana. From time to time, in order to meet release dates for selected  products and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped  directly to the stores from manufacturers and distributors.
Seasonality Similar to many retailers, Musiclands business is  seasonal. Revenues and earnings are typically greater during the second half of  the fiscal year, which includes the holiday selling season.
Competition Musiclands industry is  highly competitive. Increased downloading of entertainment and computer  software directly via the Internet, the progression of CD recording technology  and slumping music sales have all led to more intense competitive conditions.  The industry has begun to test various copy-protection techniques as a  potential means to mitigate the impact of CD recording technology advancements.  Musicland retail stores also compete with specialty retail chains, mass  merchants, bookstores and consumer electronics stores, as well as video rental  stores, mail order clubs and various Internet-based retailers.
We believe that  Musiclands convenience-based strategy, service levels and broad product  assortment, in combination with the leveraging of Best Buy stores core  competencies and the re-merchandising strategy, position Musicland to meet  current and future competitive challenges.
International Segment Overview At the end of fiscal 2002, we operated 95 Future Shop  stores in 10 Canadian provinces. The stores average 20,200 retail square feet  and produce average annual sales of approximately $15.3million per store.  Future Shop stores collectively represent 1.9million retail square feet,  or 6% of our total retail square footage. Reference is made to Part II, Item  7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of this  report for a discussion regarding risks associated with foreign operations.

The operating system includes procedures for  inventory management, transaction processing, customer relations, store  administration, staff training and performance appraisal as well as merchandise  display. Advertising, merchandise buying and pricing, and inventory policies  for Future Shop stores are centrally controlled.
Future Shops store operations are organized into three divisions, each  headed by a vice president. Each vice president has several regional managers  who closely monitor store operations and meet regularly with store managers to  review management and staff training programs, as well as customer feedback and  requests, store operating performance and other matters. Meetings involving  store management, product managers, advertising, financial and administrative  staff, as well as senior regional and global headquarters personnel, are held  quarterly to review operating results and to establish future objectives.
Future Shop stores are typically open seven days a week for  approximately 60 to 75 hours a week. A typical store is staffed by a general  manager, several department sales managers, a customer service manager and 35  to 45 associate staff, depending on store size and sales volume.
Distribution The majority of Future Shops merchandise, exclusive of appliances, is  shipped directly from suppliers to distribution centers in British Columbia and  Ontario. Future Shop uses contract carriers to ship merchandise from the  distribution centers to retail stores. Appliance sales are fulfilled by the  distribution centers or by a contracted third-party distributor. Future Shop stores  are dependent upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment  of most merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected  products, and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped  directly to the stores from manufacturers and distributors. While Future Shop  stores typically receive product shipments twice a week, shipments are  accelerated during high sales volume periods.
Seasonality Similar to many retailers, Future Shops business is  seasonal. Revenues and earnings are typically greater during the second half of  the fiscal year, which includes the holiday selling season.
Competition Future Shops industry is highly competitive. Future Shop competes  against a variety of Canadian retailers, including major department stores,  independent consumer electronics and appliance dealers, mail order  distributors, discount stores, warehouse clubs and superstores. In addition,  Future Shop competes with Internet-based retailers in Canada and the United  States. Mass merchandisers continue to increase their assortment of consumer  electronics productsprimarily those that are less complex to sell, install and  operate. Similarly, large home improvement retailers are expanding their  assortment of appliances. In addition, Canadian consumers are increasingly  downloading entertainment and computer software directly via the Internet.
