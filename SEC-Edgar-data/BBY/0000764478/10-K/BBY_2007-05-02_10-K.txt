Business.
Description of Business Best Buy Co.,Inc. (Best Buy, we or us) is a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home-office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services. We operate retail stores and commercial Web sites under the brand names Best Buy (BestBuy.com and BestBuyCanada.ca), Future Shop (FutureShop.ca), Magnolia Audio Video (MagnoliaAV.com) and Geek Squad (GeekSquad.com and GeekSquad.ca). References to our Web site addresses do not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the Web sites, and such information is not part of this document.
Our vision is to make life fun and easy for consumers. Our business strategy is to treat each customer as a unique individual, meeting their needs with end-to-end solutions, and engaging and energizing our employees to serve them, while maximizing overall profitability. We believe we offer consumers meaningful advantages in store environment, product value, product selection and a variety of in-store and in-home services related to the merchandise we offer, all of which advance our objectives of enhancing our business model, gaining market share and improving profitability. We believe that our strategic initiatives will further enhance our business model. Additional information on our strategic initiatives is included in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Organizational Changes In January 2006, we announced changes to our organizational structure to support our commitment to deliver long-term, profitable growth. Specifically, effective at the beginning of fiscal 2007, Brian J. Dunn was promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer of the company, and Robert A. Willett was promoted to Chief Executive Officer  Best Buy International. In addition, Allen U. Lenzmeier has decided to remain in his current role as Vice Chairman, serving on a part-time basis to support our international expansion.
The changes reflect our strategy of driving the performance of the current business while investing in targeted long-term growth opportunities. We believe the new organizational structure increases accountability and collaboration while enabling our leadership team to focus on growth strategies and our ongoing transformation to customer centricity.
Information About Our Segments During fiscal 2006, we operated two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of all U.S. store and online operations, including Best Buy, Magnolia Audio Video and Geek Squad. Best Buy stores offer a wide variety of consumer electronics, home-office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services. Magnolia Audio Video stores offer high-end audio and video products, and services. Geek Squad offers residential and commercial computer support. The International segment is comprised of all Canadian store and online operations, including Future Shop, Best Buy and Geek Squad. The International segment offers products and services similar to those offered by the Domestic segment. However, Canadian Best Buy stores do not carry appliances.
Financial information about our segments is included in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , and Note 10, Segments , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Domestic Segment We were incorporated in the state of Minnesota in 1966 as Sound of Music,Inc., and changed our name to Best Buy Co.,Inc. in 1983. We began as an audio components retailer and, with the introduction of the videocassette recorder in the early 1980s, expanded into video products. In 1983, we revised our marketing strategy and began using mass-merchandising techniques, which included offering a wider variety of products and operating stores under a superstore concept. In 1989, we dramatically changed our method of retailing by introducing a self-service, noncommissioned, discount-style store concept designed to give the customer more control over the purchasing process.
5 The Best Buy store format has evolved to include more interactive displays and, for certain products, a higher level of customer service, with the latest version designed to increase labor efficiency and to improve merchandising. In fiscal 2000, we introduced a small-market Best Buy store concept that offers merchandise in the same product groups as larger stores, with a product assortment tailored to each respective community.
In fiscal 2000, we also established our first online shopping site, BestBuy.com. Our clicks-and-mortar strategy is designed to empower consumers to research and purchase products seamlessly, either online or in our retail stores. The BestBuy.com online shopping site offers expanded assortments in all of our principal product groups.
In fiscal 2001, we acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi,Inc. a Seattle-based, high-end retailer of audio and video products and services to access an upscale customer segment. During fiscal 2004, Magnolia Hi-Fi began doing business as Magnolia Audio Video.
In fiscal 2003, we acquired Geek Squad,Inc. (Geek Squad). Geek Squad provides residential and commercial computer support services. We acquired Geek Squad to further our plans of providing technology support services to customers. We have since expanded Geek Squad service to be available in all U.S. Best Buy stores, as well as in 12 stand-alone stores, with more than 12,000 agents. Our goal is to build Geek Squad into North Americas largest consumer provider of computer repair, support and services, and we believe that over time it will become a significant component of our business.
In fiscal 2005, we opened our first Magnolia Home Theater store-within-a-store experience within a U.S. Best Buy store. We believe Magnolia Home Theater with its high-end brands, home-like displays and specially trained employees offers a unique solution for our customers. The Magnolia Home Theater store-within-a-store experience was offered in 107 and 23 U.S. Best Buy stores, at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively.
In fiscal 2005, we converted 67 U.S. Best Buy stores to our customer centricity operating model (segmented stores). Segmented stores offer variations in product assortments, staffing, promotions and store design, and are tailored toward key customer segments. The segmented stores tailor their store merchandising, staffing, marketing and presentation to address specific customer groups, including affluent professional males, young entertainment enthusiasts who appreciate a digital lifestyle, upscale suburban moms, families who are practical technology adopters and small businesses.
During fiscal 2006, based on the segmented stores operating results, as well as positive customer feedback, we continued to expand the roll-out of the customer centricity operating model. During fiscal 2006, we opened or converted 233 U.S. Best Buy stores to the customer centricity operating model. At the end of fiscal 2006, we operated 300 segmented stores, or 40% of total U.S. Best Buy stores.
During fiscal 2007, we plan to transition all remaining U.S.Best Buy stores to the customer centricity operating model. We plan to add the Magnolia Home Theater store-within-a-store experience to approximately 200 U.S. Best Buy stores and expand the products and services we offer to small businesses in at least 120 U.S. Best Buy stores in fiscal 2007. Further, we plan to refine our store and support functions to an integrated operating model that supports customer centricity.
At February25, 2006, we operated 742 U.S. Best Buy stores in 49 states and the District of Columbia that averaged approximately 41,300 retail square feet. Collectively, U.S. Best Buy stores totaled approximately 30.6 million retail square feet at the end of fiscal 2006, or about 90% of our total retail square footage. For fiscal 2006, U.S. Best Buy retail stores generated average revenue of approximately $38.9 million per store.
At February25, 2006, we operated 20 Magnolia Audio Video stores in California, Washington and Oregon that averaged approximately 9,700 retail square feet. Collectively, Magnolia Audio Video stores totaled approximately 194,000 retail square feet at the end of fiscal 2006, less than 1% of our total retail square footage. For fiscal 2006, Magnolia Audio Video retail stores generated average revenue of approximately $8.2 million per store.
International Segment Our International segment was established in connection with our acquisition of Canada-based Future Shop Ltd. in fiscal 2002. The Future Shop acquisition provided us with an opportunity to increase revenue, gain market share and 6 leverage our operational expertise in consumer electronics retailing. Since the acquisition, we have continued to build on Future Shops position as the leading consumer electronics retailer in Canada.
During fiscal 2003, we launched our dual-branding strategy in Canada by introducing the Best Buy brand. The dual-branding strategy allows us to retain Future Shops brand equity and attract more customers by offering a choice of store experiences. As we expand the presence of Best Buy stores in Canada, we expect to gain continued operating efficiencies by leveraging our capital investments, supply chain management, advertising, merchandising and administrative functions. Our goal is to reach differentiated customers with each brand by giving them the unique shopping experiences they desire. The primary differences between our two Canadian brands are: In-store experience The customers interaction with store employees is different at each of the two brands. Future Shop stores have mostly commissioned sales associates who take a more proactive role in assisting customers. Through their expertise and attentiveness, the sales associate drives the transaction. In contrast, Canadian Best Buy store employees are noncommissioned, and the stores offer more interactive displays and grab-and-go merchandising. This design allows the customer to drive the transaction as they experience the products themselves, with store employees available to demonstrate and explain product features.
Store size At the end of fiscal 2006, the average Future Shop store was approximately 20,700 retail square feet, compared with an average of approximately 25,400 retail square feet for Canadian Best Buy stores. Canadian Best Buy stores generally have wider aisles, as well as more square footage devoted to entertainment software. Further, Canadian Best Buy stores do not carry appliances.
We have expanded Geek Squad service to be available in all Canadian Best Buy stores, as well as in five stand-alone stores.
At February25, 2006, we operated 118 Future Shop stores throughout all Canadian provinces and 44Canadian Best Buy stores in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Collectively, International stores totaled approximately 3.6 million retail square feet at the end of fiscal 2006, or about 10% of our total retail square footage. For fiscal 2006, International retail stores generated average revenue of approximately $22.7 million per store.
As previously announced, we have begun exploring the opportunity of expanding outside of North America. In fiscal 2007 we expect to open our first store in Shanghai, China.
Acquisitions In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired certain assets of AV Audiovisions,Inc., a California company, for $7 million; in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired Howell& Associates,Inc., an Ontario company, for $1 million. Both companies specialize in the design, sales and installation of high-end home entertainment systems.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we acquired Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath Centers,Inc. (Pacific Sales). Pacific Sales, based in southern California, operates 14showrooms that cater to home-remodeling customers. In calendar 2005, Pacific Sales generated revenue of approximately $325 million. The company specializes in the sales of premium kitchen appliances, plumbing fixtures, home entertainment products and home furnishings. We acquired Pacific Sales to enhance our ability to grow with an attractive customer base and sell premium brands using a proven and successful showroom format. We expect to expand the number of Pacific Sales stores in order to capitalize on the rapidly growing high-end segment of the U.S. appliance market. Pacific Sales results of operations will be included in our Domestic segment results starting in fiscal 2007.
Discontinued Operations We acquired Musicland Stores Corporation in fiscal 2001. The original strategy behind our Musicland acquisition was to bring Best Buys core competencies in retailing consumer electronics to new customer segments, including segments typically underserved by our Best Buy stores. However, the Musicland acquisition did not meet our financial objectives. In fiscal 2004, we sold our interest in Musicland. The transaction resulted in the transfer of all of Musiclands assets other than a distribution center in Franklin, Indiana, and selected nonoperating assets. The sale of our interest in Musicland has allowed us to focus on our core businesses, 7 which are our primary growth and profit drivers. Musiclands financial results have been classified separately as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
Operations Domestic Segment U.S. Best Buy store operations are organized into eight territories. Each territory is divided into districts and is under the management of a retail field officer who oversees store performance through district managers. District managers monitor store operations and meet regularly with store managers to discuss merchandising, new product introductions, sales promotions, customer loyalty programs, employee satisfaction surveys and store operating performance. Similar meetings are conducted at the corporate level with divisional and regional management. Each district also has a loss prevention manager, with product security personnel employed at each store to control physical inventory losses. Advertising, merchandise buying and pricing, as well as inventory policies are centrally controlled.
U.S. Best Buy stores are generally open 78 hours per week, seven days a week, with extended holiday hours. An average store is typically staffed by one general manager and five managers. The average staff per store in fiscal 2006 was approximately 132 employees and varied by store depending on sales volumes.
U.S. Best Buy stores follow a standardized and detailed operating procedure called our Standard Operating Platform (SOP). The SOP includes procedures for inventory management, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, product sales and services, and merchandise display. All stores operate in the same manner under the SOP.
Magnolia Audio Video stores are typically managed by a store manager, an audio/video sales manager and, if the store contains mobile products, a mobile electronics sales manager. Magnolia Audio Video stores are generally open 72 hours per week, seven days a week. Depending on an individual stores volume and product offerings, store staffing includes six to 20 commissioned sales personnel and one to eight hourly personnel. Corporate management for Magnolia Audio Video stores centrally controls advertising, merchandise buying and pricing, as well as inventory policies.
International Segment International store operations are organized to support two brands, each headed by a vice president. Each vice president has national management who closely monitors store operations and meets regularly with store managers to review management and staff training programs, customer feedback and requests, store operating performance and other matters. Meetings involving store management, product managers, advertising, financial and administrative staff, as well as senior management, are held quarterly to review operating results and to establish future objectives.
International stores are generally open 60 to 75 hours per week, seven days a week. A typical Future Shop store is staffed by a general manager, an operations manager, several department managers and 48 to 95 sales associates, as well as part-time sales associates. A typical Canadian Best Buy store is staffed with a general manager; assistant managers for operations, merchandising, inventory and sales; and 80 to 110 sales associates, including full-time and part-time sales associates. The number of sales associates is dependent upon store size and sales volume.
International stores use a standardized operating system. The operating system includes procedures for inventory management, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, staff training and performance appraisals, as well as merchandise display. Advertising, merchandise buying and pricing, and inventory policies are centrally controlled.
Merchandise Domestic Segment U.S. Best Buy stores offer merchandise in four product groups: consumer electronics, home-office, entertainment software and appliances. Consumer electronics, the largest product group for fiscal 2006 based on revenue, consists of video and audio products and services. Video products include televisions, digital cameras, DVD players, digital camcorders and accessories. Audio products include MP3 players, home theater audio systems, mobile electronics including car stereo and satellite radio products, and related accessories. The home-office product group 8 includes notebook and desktop computers, computer support services, telephones, networking and accessories. Entertainment software products include DVD movies, video game hardware and software, CDs, computer software and subscriptions. The appliances product group includes major appliances as well as vacuums, small electrics, housewares and services.
We also provide a variety of services related to the merchandise offered within the product groups. In-store services include computer set-up, repair and software installation, as well as the installation of mobile electronics. In-home services include computer set-up, repair, software installation and home networking, and the delivery and installation of appliances and home theater systems. Services were not a significant part of our revenue in fiscal 2006. Our services business does generally provide higher gross margins than our merchandise assortment and has been a contributor to year-over-year gross margin gains. However, the infrastructure supporting that business has also increased our selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) rate. We expect to grow our services business such that over time service revenue will become a more significant component of our business.
Magnolia Audio Video stores offer merchandise in two product groups: consumer electronics and home-office. Consumer electronics, the largest product group for fiscal 2006 based on revenue, consists of video and audio products. Video products include digital televisions, DVD players, digital broadcast satellite systems, digital imaging, home theater installation, warranties and accessories. Audio products include home audio components, mobile electronics, home theater audio systems, warranties and accessories. The home-office product group consists primarily of home theater furniture.
International Segment International stores offer merchandise in four product groups: consumer electronics, home-office, entertainment software and appliances. Consumer electronics, the largest product group for fiscal 2006 based on revenue, consists of video and audio products. Video products include televisions, digital cameras, DVD players, digital camcorders and accessories. Audio products include MP3 players, home audio components, car stereos, speakers and accessories. The home-office product group includes desktop and notebook computers, telephones and accessories.
Entertainment software products include DVDs, video game hardware and software, computer software and CDs. The appliances product group includes major appliances as well as small electrics, vacuums and housewares. Canadian Best Buy stores do not carry appliances.
Although the two store brands of our International segment carry similar product categories, there are differences in product brands and depth of selection within product categories. On average, approximately 42% of the product assortment (excluding entertainment software) overlaps between the two store brands.
Distribution Domestic Segment Generally, U.S. Best Buy stores merchandise, except for major appliances and large-screen televisions, is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers located in California, Georgia, Indiana, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma and Virginia. Major appliances and large-screen televisions are shipped to satellite warehouses in each major market. U.S. Best Buy stores are dependent upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment of most merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected products and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to the stores from our suppliers. All inventory is bar-coded and scanned to ensure accurate tracking. In addition, a computerized inventory replenishment program is used to manage inventory levels at each store. On average, U.S. Best Buy stores receive product shipments two or three times a week, depending on sales volume. Contract carriers ship merchandise from the distribution centers to stores. Generally, online merchandise sales are either picked up at U.S. Best Buy stores or fulfilled directly to customers through our distribution centers.
Magnolia Audio Video stores merchandise is received and warehoused at either a distribution center in Washington, adistribution center in California or the U.S. Best Buy distribution center in California. All inventory is bar-coded and scanned to ensure accurate tracking. In addition, a 9 computerized inventory replenishment program is used to manage inventory levels at each store. Merchandise is delivered to stores an average of three times each week pursuant to an in-house distribution system.
International Segment Our International stores merchandise is shipped directly from our suppliers to our distribution centers in British Columbia and Ontario. Our International stores are dependent upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment of most merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected products and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to the stores from manufacturers and distributors. All inventory is bar-coded and scanned to ensure accurate tracking. In addition, a computerized inventory replenishment program is used to manage inventory levels at each store. Our International stores typically receive product shipments twice a week, with accelerated shipments during periods of high sales volume. Contract carriers ship merchandise from the distribution centers to stores.
Suppliers Our strategy depends, in part, upon our ability to offer customers a broad selection of name-brand products and, therefore, our success is dependent upon satisfactory and stable supplier relationships. For fiscal 2006, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately three-fifths of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers Sony, Hewlett-Packard, Gateway, Toshiba and Apple representing approximately one-third of total merchandise purchased. The loss of or disruption in supply from any one of these major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our major suppliers that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. We have no indication that any of our suppliers will discontinue selling us merchandise. We have not experienced significant difficulty in maintaining satisfactory sources of supply, and we generally expect that adequate sources of supply will continue to exist for the types of merchandise sold in our stores.
We operate three global sourcing offices in China in order to purchase products directly from Asian manufacturers. These offices have improved our product sourcing efficiency and provide us with the capability to offer private-label products that complement our existing product assortment. In the future, we expect purchases from our global sourcing offices to increase as a percentage of total purchases. We also believe that the expected increase in our global sourcing volumes will help drive gross profit rate improvements by lowering our overall product cost.
Store Development The addition of new stores has played, and we believe will continue to play, a significant role in our growth and success. Our store development program has historically focused on entering new markets; adding stores within existing markets; and relocating, remodeling and expanding existing stores. During fiscal 2006, we opened 105 new stores, converted 163 existing U.S. Best Buy stores to our customer centricity operating model, relocated 16 other stores and remodeled three other stores. While a majority of the new stores opened in fiscal 2006 were in existing markets, some were in new markets, including the opening of Canadian Best Buy stores in Quebec. During fiscal 2006 we closed one U.S. Geek Squad store and one Future Shop store.
10 The following table reconciles U.S. Best Buy stores open at the beginning and end of each of the last five fiscal years (excluding 12, six and one Geek Squad stand-alone stores at the end of fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively): FiscalYear Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Storesat Endof FiscalYear Balance forward NA NA 419 2002 62  481 2003 67  548 2004 60  608 2005 61 1 668 2006 74  742 The following table reconciles Magnolia Audio Video stores open at the beginning and end of each of the last five fiscal years: FiscalYear Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Storesat Endof FiscalYear Balance forward NA NA 13 2002   13 2003 6  19 2004 3  22 2005  2 20 2006   20 The following table reconciles Future Shop stores open at the beginning and end of each fiscal year since the date of acquisition: FiscalYear Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Storesat Endof FiscalYear Balance forward (1) NA NA 91 2002 4  95 2003 9  104 2004 4  108 2005 6  114 2006 5 1 118 (1) As of the date of acquisition, November4, 2001 The following table reconciles Canadian Best Buy stores open at the beginning and end of each fiscal year since inception of the International segment (excluding five Geek Squad stores at the end of fiscal 2006): FiscalYear Stores Opened Stores Closed Total Storesat Endof FiscalYear Balance forward NA NA NA 2002    2003 8  8 2004 11  19 2005 11  30 2006 14  44 During fiscal 2007, we expect to open nearly 90 new stores in the United States and Canada (not including the stores acquired in the Pacific Sales acquisition). Most of the new stores will be opened in markets where we already have stores, leveraging our infrastructure and making shopping more convenient for our customers. We anticipate opening 75 to 80 U.S. Best Buy stores, as well as relocating 10 to 15 existing U.S. Best Buy stores. We also expect to open approximately three Best Buy stores in Canada. We anticipate opening four to five Future Shop stores, as well as relocating approximately four existing stores. On a long-term basis, we plan to operate at least 1,200 stores in North America. Additionally, in fiscal 2007 we expect to open our first store in Shanghai, China.
Additional information regarding our Outlook for Fiscal 2007 is included in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Intellectual Property We believe we own valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks and tradenames, some of which are of material importance to our business, and include Best Buy, Yellow Tag logo, Geek Squad, Future Shop, Magnolia Audio Video and Pacific Sales. Some of our intellectual property is the subject of numerous United States and foreign trademark and service mark registrations. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company, our stores and our Web sites. We are not aware of any facts that could negatively impact our continuing use of any of our intellectual property.
11 In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), our balance sheets include the cost of acquired intellectual property only. The only material acquired intellectual property presently included in our balance sheets is the Future Shop tradename, which had a carrying value of $44 million at the end of fiscal 2006. The value of the Future Shop tradename is based on the continuation of the Future Shop brand in Canada and currently is considered an indefinite-lived intangible asset. If we ever were to abandon the Future Shop brand, we would incur an impairment charge based on the then-carrying value of the Future Shop tradename.
Seasonality Our revenue and earnings are typically greater during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday selling season.
Working Capital We fund the growth of our business through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities.
Customers We do not have a significant concentration of sales with any individual customer and, therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material impact on our business. No single customer has accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue.
Backlog Our stores and online shopping sites do not have a material amount of backlog orders.
Government Contracts No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government.
Competition The consumer electronics and home-office retail industry is highly competitive. Our stores compete against other consumer electronics retailers, specialty home-office retailers, mass merchants, home-improvement superstores and a growing number of direct-to-consumer alternatives. Our stores also compete against independent dealers, regional chain discount stores, wholesale clubs, video rental stores and other specialty retail stores. Mass merchants continue to increase their assortment of consumer electronics products, primarily those that are less complex to sell, install and operate and have been expanding their product offerings into higher-end categories. Similarly, large home-improvement retailers are expanding their assortment of appliances. In addition, consumers are increasingly downloading entertainment and computer software directly via the Internet.
We compete principally on the basis of customer service; installation and support services; store environment, location and convenience; product assortment and availability; value pricing; and financing alternatives.
We believe our store experience, broad product assortment, store formats and brand marketing strategies differentiate us from most competitors by positioning our stores as the destination for new technology and entertainment products in a fun and informative shopping environment. Our stores compete by aggressively advertising and emphasizing a complete product and service solution, value pricing and financing alternatives. In addition, our trained and knowledgeable sales and service staffs allow us to tailor the offerings to meet the needs of our customers.
Research and Development We have not engaged in any material research and development activities during the past three fiscal years.
12 Environmental Matters We are not aware of any federal, state or local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that have materially affected, or will materially affect, our net earnings or competitive position, or have resulted or will result in material capital expenditures. During fiscal 2006, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated.
Number of Employees At the end of fiscal 2006, we employed approximately 128,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees. We consider our employee relations to be good. There are currently no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees, and we have not experienced a strike or work stoppage.

Investor Relations Department 7601 Penn Avenue South Richfield, MN 55423-3645 Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Described below are certain risks that our management believes are applicable to our business and the industry in which we operate. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. There are also risks within the economy and the capital markets, both domestically 13 and internationally, that affect business generally, and our company and industry as well, such as inflation; higher interest rates; higher fuel and other energy costs; higher transportation costs; higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare; foreign exchange rate fluctuations; and higher levels of unemployment, which have not been described. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form10-K.
If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. The following risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf related to conditions or events that we anticipate may occur in the future. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.
If we do not anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner, our operating results could suffer.
Our business depends, in large part, on our ability to introduce successfully new products, services and technologies to consumers, the frequency of such introductions, the level of consumer acceptance, and the related impact on the demand for existing products, services and technologies. Failure to predict accurately constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions, or to address effectively consumer concerns, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and standing with our customers.
Our growth is dependent on the success of our strategies.
Our growth is dependent on our ability to identify, develop and execute strategies. While we believe customer centricity and the pursuit of international growth opportunities will enable us to grow our business, misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our results of operations could deteriorate if we fail to attract, develop and retain qualified employees.
Our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large and growing number of employees. We believe our competitive advantage is providing unique end-to-end solutions for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store, service and administrative personnel. The turnover rate in the retail industry is high, and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. Competition for such qualified individuals could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed to enter new growth areas such as Best Buy For Business and services. Delayed store openings, significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We face strong competition from traditional store-based retailers, Internet businesses and other forms of retail commerce , which could materially affect our revenue and profitability .
The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for customers, employees, locations, products and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional, national and international retailers. Pressure from our competitors, some of which have a greater market presence than we do, could require us to reduce our prices or increase our costs of doing business. As a result of this competition, we may experience lower revenue and/or higher operating costs, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
14 Our growth strategy includes expanding our business, both in existing markets and by opening stores in new markets.
Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build or lease new stores. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use, local zoning issues, environmental regulations and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and also influence the cost of constructing and leasing our stores. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms. Failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to build or lease new stores, which may have a material adverse effect on our future profitability.
We seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share. Because our stores typically draw customers from their local areas, a new store may draw customers away from our nearby existing stores and may cause comparable store sales performance and customer traffic at those existing stores to decline.
We also intend to open stores in new markets. The risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brand, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. And while we have a strong track record of profitable new store growth, we cannot ensure that our new stores will be profitably deployed; as a result, our future profitability may be materially adversely affected.
Risks associated with the vendors from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our revenue and gross profit.
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. Global sourcing is becoming an increasingly important part of our business and positively affects our financial performance. O ur 20largest suppliers account for approximately three-fifths of the merchandise we purchase.
If any of our key vendors fails to supply us with products, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and revenue could decline. We require all of our vendors to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required vendor standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the United States. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, outbreak of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our revenue and gross profit.
We are subject to certain regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Our regulatory and legal environment exposes us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially affect our operations and financial results. In our major global markets, we are subject to increasing regulations, which increase our cost of doing business. The most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:  The difficulty in complying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions and new or changing regulations that affect how we operate;  The impact of changes in tax laws (or interpretations thereof);  The impact of litigation trends, including class actions involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters; and  The significant uncertainties of operating globally, including the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, foreign currencies, complex laws, contractual obligations and intellectual property rights.
15 We rely heavily on our management information systems for inventory management, distribution and other functions. If our systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if we experience an interruption in their operation, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to manage our order entry, order fulfillment, pricing, point-of-sale and inventory replenishment processes. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in decreased revenue, increased overhead costs and excess or out-of-stock inventory levels, causing our business and results of operations to suffer materially.
A disruption in our relationship with Accenture, who manages our information technology and human resources operations, could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
We have engaged Accenture Ltd to manage our information technology and human resources operations. We rely heavily on our management information systems for inventory management, distribution and other functions. We also rely heavily on human resources support to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. Any disruption in our relationship with Accenture could result in decreased revenue and increased overhead costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer materially.
Failure to protect the integrity and security of our customers information could expose us to litigation and materially damage our standing with our customers.
The increasing costs associated with information security such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws and costs resulting from consumer fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. While we are taking significant efforts to protect customer and confidential information, there can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and personal data. If any such compromise of our security were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition and may increase the costs we incur to protect against such security breaches.
Failure in our pursuit or execution of new business ventures, strategic alliances and acquisitions could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Our growth strategy includes expansion via new business ventures, strategic alliances and acquisitions. While we employ several different valuation methodologies to assess a potential growth opportunity, we can give no assurance that new business ventures and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may not be able to integrate companies that we acquire successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. If we fail to integrate acquired companies successfully, our business could suffer materially. We may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. In addition, the integration of any acquired company, and its financial results, into ours may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
16 We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday selling season.
Approximately one-third of our revenue and more than one-half of our net earnings are generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday selling season. Unexpected events or developments such as natural disasters, man-made disasters and adverse economic conditions in our fourth quarter could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings.
The foregoing should not be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
At February25, 2006, there were no unresolved comments from the SEC staff regarding our periodic or current reports.

18 Domestic Segment At the end of fiscal 2006, we operated 742 U.S. Best Buy stores, 20 Magnolia Audio Video stores and 12 Geek Squad stores, totaling approximately 30.8 million retail square feet.
The operations of the Domestic segment are serviced by the following distribution centers: Location Square Footage Owned orLeased Dinuba, California 1,028,000 Owned Findlay, Ohio 1,010,000 Leased Nichols, New York 720,000 Owned Ardmore, Oklahoma (1) 720,000 Owned Franklin, Indiana 714,000 Owned Staunton, Virginia 709,000 Leased Dublin, Georgia 638,000 Leased Bloomington, Minnesota 425,000 Leased Kent, Washington 54,000 Leased Hayward, California 13,000 Leased Total 6,031,000 (1) During fiscal 2005, we opened a new distribution center in Ardmore, Oklahoma. The new and larger distribution center replaced a 566,000-square-foot owned distribution center also located in Ardmore. The 566,000-square-foot owned distribution center is currently being marketed for sale or lease.
We lease space in 13 satellite warehouses in major metropolitan markets for home delivery of major appliances and large-screen televisions. U.S. Best Buy stores utilize approximately 2.7 million square feet in these warehouses.
Our principal corporate office is located in Richfield, Minnesota, and is an owned facility consisting of four interconnected buildings totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet. During fiscal 2006 we sold a 360,000-square-foot facility in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, which previously served as our principal corporate office. At the end of fiscal 2006, we also leased approximately 420,000 square feet of additional office space.
International Segment At the end of fiscal 2006, we operated 118 Future Shop stores, 44 Canadian Best Buy stores and five Geek Squad stores, totaling approximately 3.6 million retail square feet.
The operations of our International segment are serviced by two leased distribution centers located in Langley, British Columbia, and Brampton, Ontario. The British Columbia distribution center is 419,000 square feet, and the Ontario distribution center is 1,041,000 square feet. During fiscal 2007, we expect to open another leased distribution center in Brampton, Ontario, having approximately 79,000 square feet.
The principal offices for our International segment are located in a 141,000-square-foot leased facility in Burnaby, British Columbia. At the end of fiscal 2006, we also leased 60,000 square feet of additional office space for various International segment regional offices in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta.
Global Sourcing In support of our global sourcing initiative, we lease office space in China totaling approximately 32,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2006.
Operating Leases Almost all of our stores and a majority of our distribution facilities are leased. Terms of the lease agreements generally range from 10 to 20 years. Most of the leases contain renewal options and escalation clauses.
Additional information regarding our operating leases is available in Note 7, Leases , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
On December8, 2005, a purported class action lawsuit captioned, Jasmen Holloway, et. al. v Best Buy Co.,Inc., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging we discriminate against women and minority individuals on the basis of gender, race, color and/or national origin with respect to our employment policies and practices. The action seeks an end to discriminatory policies and practices, an award of back and front pay, punitive damages and injunctive relief, including rightful place relief for all class members. We believe the allegations are without merit and intend to defend this action vigorously.
19 We are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of conducting business. We believe the amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements, as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. The resolution of those other proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Dividends In fiscal 2004, our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend, then $0.07 per common share per quarter. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per common share by 10 percent. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per common share by 9 percent to $0.08 per common share per quarter. The payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions.
Future dividend payments will depend on the Companys earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by our Board.
Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers In April2005, our Board authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. The program, which became effective on April27, 2005, terminated and replaced a $500 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June2004. Effective on June24, 2004, our Board authorized the $500 million share repurchase program, which terminated and replaced a $400 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board in fiscal 2000.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we purchased and retired 7.1 million shares at a cost of $338 million. Since the inception of the $1.5 billion share repurchase program in fiscal 2006, we purchased and retired 16.5 million shares at a cost of $711 million. We consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among other things, our cash needs and the market price of the stock. At the end of fiscal 2006, $790 million of the $1.5 billion originally authorized by our Board was available for future share repurchases. Cash provided by future operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term investments, are the expected sources of funding for the share repurchase program.

25 $ in millions, except per share amounts (footnotes continued) expense related to the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards. We elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS No.123(R)and, accordingly, financial results for fiscal years prior to 2006 have not been restated. Stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2006 was $132 ($87 net of tax). Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial results for years prior to fiscal 2006 was not significant.
(2) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, following a review of our lease accounting practices, we recorded a cumulative charge of $36 pre-tax ($23 net of tax) to correct our accounting for certain operating lease matters. Additionally, during the same quarter, we established a sales return liability which reduced gross profit by $15 pre-tax ($10 net of tax).
(3) During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we acquired Future Shop Ltd. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we acquired Musicland Stores Corporation and Magnolia Hi-Fi,Inc., which began doing business as Magnolia Audio Video during fiscal 2004. The results of operations of these businesses are included from their respective dates of acquisition.
(4) Effective on March3, 2002, we adopted SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
During fiscal 2003, we completed the required goodwill impairment testing and recognized an after-tax, noncash impairment charge of $40 that is reflected in our fiscal 2003 financial results as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Also effective on March3, 2002, we changed our method of accounting for vendor allowances in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.02-16, Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor.
The change resulted in an after-tax, noncash charge of $42 that also is reflected in our fiscal 2003 financial results as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Fiscal 2002 has not been restated to reflect the pro forma effects of these changes.
(5) Earnings per share is presented on a diluted basis and reflects three-for-two stock splits effected in August2005 and May2002.
(6) Comprised of revenue at stores and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
During fiscal 2004, we refined our methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage gain to reflect the impact of non-point-of-sale (non-POS) revenue transactions. We refined our comparable store sales calculation in light of changes in our business. Previously, our comparable store sales calculation was based on store POS revenue. The comparable store sales percentage gains for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 have been computed using the refined methodology. The comparable store sales percentage gains for prior fiscal years have not been computed using the refined methodology. Refining the methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage gain did not impact previously reported revenue, net earnings or cash flows.
(7) Includes both continuing and discontinued operations. The current ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities.
(8) Excludes Geek Squad stand-alone stores.
26 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
We believe transparency and understandability are the primary goals of successful financial reporting. We remain committed to increasing the transparency of our financial reporting, providing our shareholders with informative financial disclosures and presenting an accurate view of ourfinancial position and operating results.
In accordance with Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that such controls were effective as of February25, 2006. Our independent registered public accounting firm expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Managements report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and the related report of our independent registered public accounting firm are included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in eight sections:  Overview  Strategic Initiatives  Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  Critical Accounting Estimates  New Accounting Standards  Outlook for Fiscal 2007 We believe our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
On June23, 2005, our Board approved a three-for-two stock split. Shareholders of record as of July13, 2005, received one additional share for every two shares owned, with fractional shares being redeemed for cash. The additional shares were distributed on August3, 2005. All share and per share information herein reflect this stock split.
Unless otherwise noted, this MD&A relates only to results from continuing operations. All periods presented reflect the classification of Musiclands financial results as discontinued operations.
Overview Best Buy Co.,Inc. is a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home-office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services.
We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations of U.S. Best Buy, Magnolia Audio Video and U.S. Geek Squad. U.S. Best Buy stores offer a wide variety of consumer electronics, home-office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services, operating 742 stores in 49 states and the District of Columbia at the end of fiscal 2006. Magnolia Audio Video stores offer high-end audio and video products and services from 20 stores located in California, Washington and Oregon at the end of fiscal 2006. U.S. Geek Squad offers computer repair, support and installation services in all U.S. Best Buy stores and 12 stand-alone stores at the end of fiscal 2006. Pacific Sales Kitchenand Bath Centers,Inc. (Pacific Sales), which we acquired in March2006, will be included in the Domestic segment starting in fiscal 2007.
The International segment was established in connection with our acquisition of Future Shop in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. At the end of fiscal 2006, the International segment consisted of 118 Future Shop stores operating throughout all Canadian provinces, and 44 Canadian Best Buy stores operating in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In addition, Canadian Geek Squad offers computer repair, support and installation services in all Canadian Best Buy stores and in 27 five stand-alone stores at the end of fiscal 2006. The International segment offers products and services similar to those offered by the Domestic segment, although Canadian Best Buy stores do not sell appliances.
In support of our retail store operations, we also operate Web sites for each of our brands (BestBuy.com, BestBuyCanada.ca, FutureShop.ca, MagnoliaAV.com, GeekSquad.com, GeekSquad.ca and PacificSales.com).
Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. Historically, we have realized more of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday selling season, than in any other fiscal quarter. The timing of new-store openings, costs associated with the development of new businesses, as well as general economic conditions may also affect our future quarterly results.
Financial Reporting Changes On December16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (123(R)), effective for a companys first fiscal year beginning after June15, 2005. SFAS No.123(R)supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees . SFAS No.123(R)requires all stock-based compensation, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we early-adopted SFAS No.123(R), and elected the modified prospective transition method. This method permits us to apply the new requirements on a prospective basis. Our selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) rate for fiscal 2006 included an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $133 million ($88 million net of tax, or $0.17 per diluted share), which increased our SG&A rate by approximately 0.4% of revenue compared with the prior fiscal year. For additional information on our adoption of SFAS No.123(R), see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Stock-Based Compensation , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we reclassified variable-rate demand notes from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments. Prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current-year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported total assets or net earnings. For additional information regarding our variable-rate demand notes, refer to Note 3, Investments , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Strategic Initiatives Our vision is to make life fun and easy for consumers. Our business strategy is to treat each customer as a unique individual, meeting their needs with end-to-end solutions, and engaging and energizing our employees to serve them, while maximizing overall profitability. During fiscal 2006, our primary strategic initiative was accelerating our transformation to a customer-centric organization. Customer centricity contributed to our strong growth during fiscal 2006 and is expected to provide the framework to grow and further enhance our business in the future.
Customer Centricity Our customers are at the core of all of our business strategies. Customer centricity has moved beyond an initiative and is now how we do business. Customer centricity means treating each customer as a unique individual, meeting their needs with end-to-end solutions, and engaging and energizing our employees to serve them. Mass merchants, direct sellers, other specialty retailers and online retailers are increasingly interested in our product categories because of rising demand. If we can understand our customers better than our competitors do, and if we can inspire our employees to have richer interactions with customers, then we can more effectively compete. Customer centricity has been, and will continue to be, a growth driver for us.
Accelerating Our Transformation In fiscal 2006 we implemented five key strategies to accelerate our customer centricity initiative.
First, we converted or opened a record number of stores with the customer-centric operating model, finishing the 28 fiscal year with 300 customer centricity stores, or 40% of U.S. Best Buy stores.
Second, we expanded and strengthened our services offering by adding 5,000 Geek Squad agents. In addition, we brought our previously outsourced home theater installation services in-house to serve our customers better.
Third, we expanded individualized marketing capabilities through our Reward Zone customer loyalty program. Memberships in Reward Zone increased approximately 50% to more than seven million members and gained key insights about customer purchase patterns.
Fourth, because customer centricity relies on employees engaging with customers in new ways, we focused on increasing employee retention. During the fiscal year we changed how we manage our people, made more extensive use of strengths-based tools and created an incentive system in which all store employees could be effectively rewarded. Our efforts reduced store employee turnover by 15% compared with the previous fiscal year.
Fifth, we embarked on a three-year plan to re-engineer our supply chain and information technology systems. This work is aimed at streamlining our processes in order to improve the customer experience in important areas such as product in-stock levels. Initial results are promising our systems are faster, cost less and have the flexibility to adjust as we transform the customer experience.
Profitably Scaling Customer Centricity Scaling and refining our customer-centric operating model remains our primary strategy for fiscal 2007. Customer centricity allows us to better serve the unmet needs of consumers and develop new growth channels. During fiscal 2007, we are committed to scaling the model profitably across U.S. Best Buy.
We have set six priorities for fiscal 2007 that support our transformation to a customer-centric company.
One, we plan to implement a single, customer-centric operating model at our corporate campus by the end of fiscal 2007. Moving to a single operating model will eliminate redundant work and unify the organization. We also will divest resources in mature areas so we can invest resources in growth areas, such as small businesses, services and home theater.
Two, we will continue to grow organically. We plan to open approximately 90 new stores in North America. We also anticipate opening 200 more Magnolia Home Theaters inside U.S. Best Buy stores, taking advantage of rising consumer interest in flat-panel TVs.
Three, we plan to build our small-business capabilities. This priority includes increasing our Best Buy For Business locations to more than 200 stores and training more than 900 Microsoft-certified professionals by year end.
Four, we expect to grow our services business by driving productivity improvements in computer services and home theater installation. We also plan to drive gains through the implementation of new tools, the benefits of scale and a market-based approach to home visits.
Five, we plan to enhance our ability to provide complete solutions to customers by giving our employees better tools and capabilities for describing, demonstrating and selling solutions such as digital music subscriptions, digital cable and voice-over-Internet telephony.
Six, we plan to pursue international growth opportunities. Specifically, we anticipate leveraging our investments in Canada, where we operate both Future Shop and Best Buy stores, while we embark on a controlled growth strategy in China.
Our company priorities are aimed at refining this model and investing in the capabilities and customer experiences that will drive long-term profitable growth.
Results of Operations Fiscal 2006 Summary  Earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 increased 22% to $1.1 billion, or $2.27 per diluted share, compared with $934 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, for fiscal 2005. The increase was driven by revenue growth, including a comparable store sales gain of 4.9%, and an increase in our gross profit rate, and 29 was partially offset by an increase in our SG&A rate. In addition, earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 benefited from net interest income of $77 million, compared with net interest income of $1 million for the prior fiscal year, and a lower effective income tax rate.
Net earnings for fiscal 2006 reflect the impact of early-adopting SFAS No.123(R), which resulted in an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $132 million ($87 million net of tax, or $0.17 per diluted share). In addition, net earnings for fiscal 2006 included income of $43 million ($29 million net of tax, or $0.06 per diluted share) related to our initial recognition of gift card breakage (gift cards sold where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote). Gift card breakage income was not recorded in fiscal 2005 or prior years.
Revenue for fiscal 2006 increased 12% to $30.8 billion. The increase reflected market share gains and was driven by the net addition of 103 new stores during fiscal 2006, a full year of revenue from stores added in fiscal 2005 and the 4.9% comparable store sales increase. The remainder of the increase was due primarily to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Our gross profit rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 25.0% of revenue. The increase was driven by the continued transformation of our supply chain, which enabled us to improve margins through lower product costs, more effective pricing strategies, and increased sales of higher-margin services and private-label products. We also benefited from better product transition management and a more stable promotional environment.
Our SG&A rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 19.7% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to increased performance-based incentive compensation resulting from our strong financial performance, a growing number of stores operating under the higher-cost customer-centric labor model and costs associated with supporting our services business, and was partially offset by expense leverage resulting from a higher revenue base. The change in our accounting for stock-based compensation increased our fiscal 2006 SG&A rate by approximately 0.4% of revenue compared with the prior fiscal year.
During fiscal 2006, we opened 70 U.S. Best Buy stores and converted 163 existing U.S. Best Buy stores with the customer-centric operating model (segmented stores). At the end of fiscal 2006, we operated 300 segmented stores, or 40% of total U.S. Best Buy stores.
Effective with the cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 9 percent, to $0.08 per common share. During fiscal 2006, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.31 per common share, or $151 million in the aggregate.
During fiscal 2006, we purchased and retired 18.3 million shares at a cost of $772 million pursuant to our share repurchase programs.
In fiscal 2006, we and the Best Buy Childrens Foundation contributed approximately $30 million to local communities, including contributions for the communities and people affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita.

(1) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, following a review of our lease accounting practices, we recorded a cumulative pre-tax charge of $36 ($23 net of tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) to correct our accounting for certain operating lease matters. Additionally, we established a sales return liability which reduced revenue by $65 and gross profit by $15 ($10 net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share). Finally, based on the favorable resolution of outstanding tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service regarding the disposition of our interest in Musicland, we recorded a $50 tax benefit. The tax benefit is included in gain (loss) from discontinued operations.
(2) Comprised of revenue at stores and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Continuing Operations Fiscal 2006 Results Compared With Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2006 earnings from continuing operations were $1.1 billion, or $2.27 per diluted share, compared with $934 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, for fiscal 2005. The increase was driven by revenue growth, including the addition of new stores during fiscal 2006 and a comparable store sales gain of 4.9%, and a significant increase in our gross profit rate. These factors were partially offset by an increase in our SG&A expenses. In addition, earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 benefited from net interest income of $77 million, compared with net interest income of $1 million for the prior fiscal year, and a lower effective income tax rate.
Revenue for fiscal 2006 increased 12% to $30.8 billion, compared with $27.4 billion for fiscal 2005. The increase resulted from the net addition of 103 stores during fiscal 2006, a full year of revenue from new stores added in fiscal 2005, the 4.9% comparable store sales gain and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The addition of new stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for more than one-half of the revenue increase for fiscal 2006. The comparable store sales gain accounted for nearly two-fifths of the revenue increase, and the remainder of the revenue increase was due primarily to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as income related to our initial recognition of gift card breakage.
We believe our comparable store sales gain for fiscal 2006benefited from continued demand for the latest technologies and advanced product features. In addition, the increased affordability of consumer electronics products contributed to the comparable store sales gain. Products having the largest impact on our fiscal 2006 comparable store sales gain included flat-panel televisions, MP3 players and accessories, notebook computers, digital cameras and accessories, and video gaming hardware. Flat-panel 31 television sales were very strong as unit-volume growth and increased screen size more than offset declines in the average selling prices of these products. MP3 products also generated strong comparable store sales gains as customers continue to adopt, upgrade and add accessories to digital music players.
Our gross profit rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 25.0% of revenue. The increase was driven by the continued transformation of our supply chain, which enabled us to improve margins through lower product costs, more effective pricing strategies and increased sales of higher-margin services; and private-label products. We also benefited from better product transition management and a more stable promotional environment.
Our SG&A rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 19.7% of revenue.
The increase was due primarily to increased performance-based incentive compensation resulting from our strong financial performance; a growing number of stores operating under the higher-cost, customer-centric labor model; costs associated with supporting our services business and the absence of favorable settlements with two credit card companies as recognized in fiscal 2005. These factors were partially offset by expense leverage resulting from a higher revenue base, as well as the absence of charges recognized in fiscal 2005 to correct our accounting for leases and to settle litigation. The change in our accounting for stock-based compensation increased our fiscal 2006 SG&A rate by approximately 0.4% of revenue compared with the prior fiscal year.
Because retailers do not uniformly record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of goods sold and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to certain other retailers. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of goods sold and SG&A, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financials Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Fiscal 2005 Results Compared With Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2005 earnings from continuing operations were $934 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, compared with $800 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, for fiscal 2004. The increase was driven primarily by revenue growth, including a comparable store sales gain of 4.3%, and an improvement in our SG&A rate, and was partially offset by a decrease in our gross profit rate. In addition, earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 benefited from net interest income of $1 million, compared with net interest expense of $8 million for fiscal 2004, and a lower effective income tax rate.
Revenue for fiscal 2005 increased 12% to $27.4 billion, compared with $24.5 billion for fiscal 2004. The increase resulted from the addition of 78 stores in fiscal 2005, a full year of revenue from new stores added in fiscal 2004, the 4.3% comparable store sales gain and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The addition of new stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for approximately three-fifths of the revenue increase for fiscal 2005. The comparable store sales gain accounted for nearly two-fifths of the revenue increase, and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for the remainder of the revenue increase.
We believe our comparable store sales gain for fiscal 2005 reflected improved in-store execution, including our ability to increase the close rate and average ticket, which more than offset customer traffic declines in our stores. In addition, our fiscal 2005 comparable store sales gain benefited from continued demand for digital products and our effective advertising and promotional campaigns, including a full year of Reward Zone, our customer loyalty program introduced in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Products having the largest impact on our fiscal 2005 comparable store sales gain included digital televisions, MP3 players, digital cameras and accessories, notebook computers, DVDs and major appliances. We believe the increase in revenue from digital products reflected the continued consumer migration to and increased affordability of digital products, while the increase in notebook computers was driven primarily by consumers continued attraction to the portability of these products.
Our gross profit rate for fiscal 2005 declined by 0.2% of revenue to 23.7% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to a more promotional environment compared with fiscal 2004, including a full year of impact from and increased membership in Reward Zone. Reward Zone contributed to the revenue gain for fiscal 2005, but reduced the fiscal 2005 gross profit rate by approximately 0.5% of 32 revenue, compared with a 0.3% of revenue reduction in the gross profit rate for fiscal 2004. In addition, our gross profit rate was affected by a higher level of promotional activity initiated to increase revenue and stem customer traffic declines, a trend we believe was experienced throughout the consumer electronics retail industry. The increase in promotional activity was partially offset by the increase of services revenue in the revenue mix, as services carry a higher gross profit rate, and benefits from our global sourcing initiative which enabled us to improve margins through lower product costs.
Our SG&A rate for fiscal 2005 declined by 0.2% of revenue to 18.4% of revenue. The improvement was due primarily to reduced performance-based incentive compensation, expense leverage from the comparable store sales gain and the addition of new stores, and the realization of cost savings from our efficient enterprise initiative. Our fiscal 2005 SG&A rate also benefited from favorable settlements with two credit card companies. These factors were partially offset by additional expenses associated with our customer centricity initiative, and charges to correct our accounting for leases and to settle litigation which, collectively, increased our SG&A rate for fiscal 2005 by approximately 0.2% of revenue.
Segment Performance Domestic The following table presents selected financial data for our Domestic segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($inmillions): DomesticSegmentPerformanceSummary(unaudited) 2006 2005 2004 Revenue $ 27,380 $ 24,616 $ 22,225 Total revenue gain % 11 % 11 % 15 % Comparable stores sales % gain (1) 5.1 % 4.4 % 7.4 % Gross profit as % of revenue 25.3 % 23.8 % 24.1 % SG&A as % of revenue 19.5 % 18.2 % 18.4 % Operating income $ 1,588 $ 1,393 $ 1,267 Operating income as % of revenue 5.8 % 5.7 % 5.7 % Note:All periods presented reflect the classification of Musiclands financial results as discontinued operations.
(1) Comprised of revenue at stores and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening.
For fiscal 2006, our Domestic segments operating income was $1.6 billion, or 5.8% of revenue, compared with $1.4 billion, or 5.7% of revenue, for fiscal 2005. The Domestic segments operating income rate for fiscal 2006 benefited from revenue gains, including the addition of new stores during fiscal 2006 and a 5.1% comparable store sales increase, and an increase in the gross profit rate, partially offset by an increase in the SG&A rate.
Our Domestic segments revenue for fiscal 2006 increased 11% to $27.4 billion. The addition of new stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for over one-half of the revenue increase for fiscal 2006, and the remainder of therevenue increase was due primarily to the 5.1% comparable store sales gain.
We believe our Domestic segments comparable store sales gain for fiscal 2006 benefited from continued demand for increased features, assortment, portability and affordability of consumer electronics products. Our Domestic segments consumer electronics product group posted a 15.0% comparable store sales gain for fiscal 2006, driven by sales of flat-panel televisions, and MP3 players and accessories. Strong sales of flat-panel televisions resulted from unit-volume growth and increased screen size, which more than offset declines in the average selling prices of these products. MP3 products also generated strong comparable store sales gains as customers continued to adopt, upgrade and add accessories to digital music players. A 0.3% comparable store sales gain in our Domestic segments home-office product group was driven primarily by sales of 33 notebook computers, reflecting expanded assortments and continued customer demand for portable technology, and an increase in computer services revenue. A 6.3% comparable store sales increase in our Domestic segments appliances product group was driven primarily by the expansion of our improved appliance assortments and an increase in the average selling prices of major appliances.
Our Domestic segments entertainment software product group recorded a 5.7% comparable store sales decline for fiscal 2006. Continued softness in the sales of new movie and music releases contributed to the comparable store sales decrease. This decrease was partially offset by strong customer response to the launches of PlayStation Portable and the Xbox 360 console, which more than offset softness in sales of gaming platforms leading up to these anticipated launches.
Our Domestic segments gross profit rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 1.5% of revenue to 25.3% of revenue. The increase was driven by the continued transformation of our supply chain, which enabled us to improve margins through lower product costs, more effective pricing strategies, and increased sales of higher-margin services and private-label products. We also benefited from better product transition management, a more stable promotional environment and income related to our initial recognition of gift card breakage.
Our Domestic segments SG&A rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 19.5% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to increased incentive compensation based on our strong operating results, a growing number of stores operating under the customer-centric labor model and costs associated with supporting our services business, partially offset by expense leverage resulting from a higher revenue base and the absence of charges recognized in fiscal 2005 to correct our accounting for leases and to settle litigation. The change in our accounting for stock-based compensation increased our fiscal 2006 SG&A rate by approximately 0.5% of revenue compared with the prior fiscal year.

34 International The following table presents selected financial data for our International segment for each of the past three fiscal years ($inmillions): InternationalSegmentPerformanceSummary(unaudited) 2006 2005 2004 Revenue $ 3,468 $ 2,817 $ 2,323 Total revenue gain % 23 % 21 % 41 % Comparable stores sales % gain (1) 2.8 % 3.3 % 4.7 % Gross profit as % of revenue 22.9 % 22.5 % 22.2 % SG&A as % of revenue 21.3 % 20.7 % 20.6 % Operating income $ 56 $ 49 $ 37 Operating income as % of revenue 1.6 % 1.7 % 1.6 % (1) Comprised of revenue at stores and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
For fiscal 2006, our International segments operating income was $56 million, or 1.6% of revenue, compared with $49 million, or 1.7% of revenue, for fiscal 2005. The International segments $7 million increase in operating income resulted primarily from revenue gains, including the addition of new stores during fiscal 2006 and a 2.8% comparable store sales increase.
Our International segments revenue for fiscal 2006 increased 23% to $3.5 billion for fiscal 2006, compared with $2.8 billion for fiscal 2005. The addition of new stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for over one-half of the revenue increase for fiscal 2006; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately one-third of the revenue increase; and the 2.8% comparable store sales gain accounted for the remainder of the revenue increase. We believe the comparable store sales increase reflected market share gains and was driven by increased revenue from flat-panel televisions, and MP3 players and accessories.
Our International segments consumer electronics and appliances groups posted an 8.2% and 18.0% comparable store sales gain for fiscal 2006, respectively. Our International segments home-office and entertainment software groups recorded a 0.2% and 7.6% comparable store sales decline for fiscal 2006, respectively.
Our International segments gross profit rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 0.4% of revenue to 22.9% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to improved product margins and the favorable comparison with an early contract termination penalty incurred in the prior fiscal year.
Our International segments SG&A rate for fiscal 2006 increased by 0.6% of revenue to 21.3% of revenue. The increase was due primarily to costs incurred as a result of restructuring our International segments operations, including severance costs associated with staff reductions, as well as incremental costs to roll out Canadian Best Buy stores in Quebec. The change in our accounting for stock-based compensation increased our fiscal 2006 SG&A rate by approximately 0.1% of revenue compared with the prior fiscal year.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and the Future Shop tradename. Based on expectations for the business and the prevailing retail environment, we determined that no impairment existed. However, if future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or if we ever were to discontinue the use of the Future Shop tradename as a result of abandoning our dual-branding strategy in Canada or otherwise, we may be exposed to an impairment charge in the future.

Discontinued Operations The sale of Musicland during fiscal 2004 resulted in an after-tax loss on the disposal of discontinued operations totaling $66 million. The results of discontinued operations for fiscal 2004 are included through the date of the sale, June16, 2003. For additional information regarding discontinued operations, refer to Note 2, Discontinued Operations , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
The results from discontinued operations for the past three fiscal years are as follows ($ in millions): FortheFiscalYearsEnded Feb.25, 2006 Feb.26, 2005 Feb.28, 2004 Revenue $  $  $ 354 Loss before income taxes   (46 ) Loss before the disposal and the cumulative effect of accounting   changes, net of $17 tax   (29 ) Gain (loss) on disposal of discontinued operations (1)  50 (66 ) Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $  $ 50 $ (95 ) (1) Fiscal 2005 gain on disposal of discontinued operations represents the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets as a result of the favorable resolution of outstanding tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service regarding the disposition of our interest in Musicland. The fiscal 2004 loss on disposal of discontinued operations is net of $25 million tax benefit offset by a $25 million valuation allowance.
36 Additional Consolidated Results Net Interest Income (Expense) Net interest income increased to $77 million for fiscal 2006, compared with net interest income of $1 million for fiscal 2005. The increase in net interest income was primarily a result of higher yields on investments and higher average investment balances. Fiscal 2006 net interest income included $8 million of interest expense related to our financing leases, while fiscal 2005 included $21 million of interest expense related to our financing leases as a result of correcting our accounting for leases in fiscal 2005.
We reported net interest income of $1 million for fiscal 2005, compared with net interest expense of $8 million for fiscal 2004. The change in net interest income (expense) was primarily a result of higher yields on short-term investments, higher average investment balances and the repayment in June2004 of our convertible debentures due in 2021. These factors were partially offset by a charge of $21 million to correct our accounting for leases.
For additional information regarding net interest income (expense), refer to Note 6, Net Interest Income (Expense) , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate decreased to 33.7% for fiscal 2006, compared with 35.3% for fiscal 2005. The decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2006 was primarily due to increased income tax benefits from our foreign operations and higher levels of tax-exempt interest.
Our effective income tax rate decreased to 35.3% for fiscal 2005, down from 38.3% for fiscal 2004. The decrease was due to resolution and clarification of various state and federal tax matters. During fiscal 2005, we reduced our tax contingencies reserve due to the favorable resolution and clarification of certain federal and state income tax matters, including a favorable ruling from the IRS and the completion of IRS and certain state tax audits for fiscal 2000 through fiscal 2002.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The impact of inflation and changing prices has not been material to our revenue or earnings from continuing operations in any of the last three fiscal years. Highly competitive market conditions and the general economic environment minimized inflations impact on the selling prices of our products and services, and on our expenses. In addition, price deflation and the continued commoditization of key technology products affect our ability to increase our gross profit rate.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary We ended fiscal 2006 with $3.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, an increase from $3.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2005. Working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, was $1.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2006, consistent with the end of fiscal 2005.
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our short-term investments are comprised of municipal and U.S. government debt securities, with original maturities greater than 90 days but less than one year. Long-term investments are also comprised of municipal and U.S. government debt securities, but with original maturities of one year or more.
In accordance with our investment policy, we place our investments in debt securities with issuers who have high-quality credit and limit the amount of investment exposure to any one issuer. We seek to preserve principal and minimize exposure to interest-rate fluctuations by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk.
The carrying amount of our investments in debt securities approximated fair value at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, due to the rapid turnover of our portfolio and the highly liquid nature of these investments. Therefore, there were no significant unrealized holding gains or losses.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we reclassified our variable-rate demand notes from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments for all periods presented.
These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported total assets or net earnings.
37 Our liquidity is affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for general liability insurance, workers compensation insurance and warranty programs. Restricted cash balances, which are included in other current assets, totaled $178 million and $158 million as of February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively.
Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in millions): FiscalYear 2006 2005 2004 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating   activities $ 1,695 $ 1,981 $ 1,387 Investing   activities (754 ) (1,422 ) (1,376 ) Financing   activities (641 ) (459 ) (87 ) Effect of   exchange rate changes on cash 27 9 1 Discontinued   operations, net   (53 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 327 $ 109 $ (128 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for fiscal 2006, compared with $2.0 billion for fiscal 2005 and $1.4 billion for fiscal 2004. The decline in operating cash flows for fiscal 2006, compared with fiscal 2005, was due primarily to a decrease in cash provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by increased earnings from continuing operations.
Earnings from continuing operations increased to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2006, compared with $934 million for fiscal 2005. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were due primarily to increased merchandise inventories and a decrease in accrued income taxes. Merchandise inventories increased in fiscal 2006, due primarily to the addition of new stores and changes in product mix, including expanded assortments of notebook computers, flat-panel televisions, and digital cameras and accessories. The increased inventory levels also reflected our efforts to improve in-stock positions in product categories that have been driving our revenue growth. Accrued income taxes decreased in fiscal 2006 due primarily to a lower effective income tax rate combined with timing of payments.
Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $754 million for fiscal 2006, compared with $1.4 billion for both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. The decrease in cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2006, compared with fiscal 2005, was due primarily to decreased net purchases of short-term and long-term investments in debt securities, partially offset by increased capital spending. Refer to Capital Expenditures in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A for additional information. In fiscal 2006, we used cash for the construction of new retail locations, information systems and other store projects, including the conversion of 163 U.S. Best Buy stores to our customer centricity platform. The primary purposes of the cash investment activity were to support our expansion plans, improve our operational efficiency and enhance shareholder value.
Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $641 million for fiscal 2006, compared with $459 million and $87 million for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. The increase in cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2006, compared with fiscal 2005, was due primarily to an increase in repurchases of our common stock. During fiscal 2006 we repurchased $772 million of our common stock, compared with $200 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in repurchases of common stock was partially offset by a decline in long-term debt repayments. During fiscal 2005 we redeemed our convertible debentures due in 2021 for $355 million.
38 Discontinued Operations Net cash used in discontinued operations was $53 million for fiscal 2004. There was no cash used in discontinued operations in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 due to the sale ofour interest in Musicland during the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
Sources of Liquidity Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe funds generated from the expected results of operations, available cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to finance anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives for the next fiscal year. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facilities.
We have a $200 million bank revolving credit facility which is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. The facility expires on December22, 2009, and replaced a $200 million revolving credit facility that would have expired on March21, 2005. Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates specified in the credit agreement. We also pay certain facility and agent fees. The agreement contains covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios. As of February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, $199 million and $139 million, respectively, were available under these facilities. There were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities for any period presented. However, amounts outstanding under letters of credit reduce amounts available under these facilities.
We also have inventory financing facilities through which certain suppliers receive payments from a designated finance company on invoices we owe them. At February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, $59 million and $68 million, respectively, were outstanding and $177 million and $157 million, respectively, were available for use under these inventory financing facilities.
Our International segment has a $22 million revolving demand facility, of which $17 million is available from Februarythrough Julyand $22 million is available from Augustthrough Januaryof each year. There is no set expiration date for this facility. All borrowings under this facility are made available at the sole discretion of the lender and are payable on demand. Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates specified in the credit agreement. The agreement for this facility contains certain reporting and operating covenants. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility for any period presented. However, amounts outstanding under letters of credit and letters of guarantee reduced amounts available under this facility to $17 million and $15 million, at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively.
Our ability to access our credit facilities is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facilities, including financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. At the end of fiscal 2006, we were in compliance with all such covenants. In the event we were to default on any of our other debt, it would constitute a default under our credit facilities as well.
We offer our customers extended financing through a third-party financial institution. The third-party institution assumes the risk of collection from our customers and has no recourse against us for uncollectible amounts. Generally, these financing offers allow customers to purchase products with repayment terms ranging from 90 days to 24 months without a finance charge. Our contract with the third-party financial institution extends through January2009. If the contract were to be terminated prior to January2009, we believe we could contract with an alternative third-party financial institution or directly provide our customers with extended financing.
An interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre-tax earnings before fixed charges (interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense) to fixed charges. Our interest coverage ratio calculated as reported in Exhibit12.1 of this Annual Report on Form10-K was 9.8 and 8.4 for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively.
39 Our credit ratings as of April28, 2006, were as follows: RatingAgency Rating Outlook Fitch (1) BBB+ Stable Moodys (2) Baa2 Stable Standard& Poors BBB Stable (1) In April2006, Fitch Ratings revised its ratings from BBB with a positive outlook to BBB+ with a stable outlook, reflecting our leading market position and successful operating strategy which has resulted in strong revenue growth and operating performance. The upgrade also reflects our highly liquid balance sheet and considers our exposure to a very competitive industry and changes in consumer spending over time.
(2) In April2006, Moodys Investors Service revised its ratings from Baa3 with a positive outlook to Baa2 with a stable outlook based on our ability to generate comparable store sales gains, while improving operating profit margins, our continued investment in opening or converting stores to the customer-centric platform, our ability to maintain our liquidity and credit metrics, and expectations that our varied growth initiatives will not adversely affect revenue or net earnings.
Factors that can impact our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new-store occupancy costs. In addition, the conversion rights of the holders of our convertible subordinated debentures could be accelerated if our credit ratings were to be downgraded.
Capital Expenditures A component of our long-term strategy is our capital expenditure program. This program includes, among other things, investments in new stores, store remodeling, store relocations and expansions, new distribution facilities and information technology enhancements. During fiscal 2006, we invested $648 million in property and equipment, including opening 105 new stores, converting 163 stores to our customer centricity operating model, relocating 16stores and upgrading our information technology systems. Capital expenditures are funded through cash provided by operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
Refer to the Outlook for Fiscal 2007 section of this MD&A for information on our capital expenditure plans for fiscal2007.

(2) Construction of our new corporate campus was completed during fiscal 2004.
Debt and Capital In January2002, we sold convertible subordinated debentures having an aggregate principal amount of $402 million. The proceeds from the offering, net of $6 million in offering expenses, were $396 million. The debentures mature in 2022 and are callable at par, at our option, for cash on or after January15, 2007.
Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January15, 2007; January15, 2012; and January15, 2017, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. We have the option to settle the purchase price in 40 cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. Since holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January15, 2007, we have classified our convertible subordinated debentures in the current portion of long-term debt at February25, 2006.
The debentures will be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 21.7391 shares per$0.001 principal amount of debentures, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $46.00 per share, if the closing price of our common stock exceeds a specified price for 20consecutive trading days in a 30-trading day period preceding the date of conversion, if our credit rating falls below specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur. At February25, 2006, none of the criteria for conversion had been met. Since March31, 2006, our closing stock price has exceeded the specified stock price for more than 20 days, therefore, holders currently have the option to convert their debentures into our common stock.
As of May9, 2006, no debentures had been converted to shares of our common stock.
The debentures have an initial interest rate of 2.25% per annum. The interest rate may be reset, but not below 2.25% or above 3.25%, on July15, 2006; July15, 2011; and July15, 2016. One of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the convertible debentures.
In June2004, we redeemed our convertible debentures that were due in 2021 for $355 million.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, in connection with the review of our lease accounting practices, we recorded a $107 million financing lease obligation for leases that did not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting treatment. At the end of fiscal 2006, $157 million is outstanding under financing lease obligations.
We had a master lease program which was used to construct and lease new retail locations. At the end of fiscal 2005, $55 million in leases related to new stores were outstanding under the master lease program. In May2005, we repaid the outstanding balance of $54 million on our master lease obligation.
Share Repurchases and Dividends In April2005, our Board authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. The program, which became effective April27, 2005, terminated and replaced a $500 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June2004. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases under the $1.5 billion share repurchase program.
The $500 million share repurchase program, which became effective on June24, 2004, terminated and replaced a $400 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board in fiscal 2000.
During fiscal 2006, we purchased and retired 16.5 million shares at a cost of $711 million under the $1.5 billion share repurchase program, and 1.8 million shares at a cost of $61 million under the $500 million share repurchase program. At the end of fiscal 2006, $790 million of the $1.5 billion originally authorized by our Board was available for future share repurchases.
During fiscal 2005, we purchased and retired 3.4 million shares at a cost of $118 million under the $500 million share repurchase program, and 2.4 million shares at a cost of $82 million under the $400 million share repurchase program.
We consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among other things, our cash needs and the market price of our stock. We expect that cash provided by future operating activities, as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, will be the sources of funding for the share repurchase program.
In fiscal 2004, our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend, then $0.07 per common share per quarter. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 we increased our quarterly cash dividend per common share by 10 percent. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per common share by 9 percent, to $0.08 per share per quarter. The payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. During fiscal 2006, we made four dividend 41 payments totaling $0.31 per common share, or $151 million in the aggregate.
During fiscal 2006, we returned a total of $923 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other than operating leases, we do not have any off-balance-sheet financing. We finance a portion of our new-store development program through sale-leaseback transactions, which involve selling stores to unrelated parties and then leasing the stores back under leases that are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with GAAP .
A summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in Contractual Obligations section below. Additional information regarding our operating leases is available in Item 2, Properties , and Note 7, Leases , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Our debt-to-capitalization ratio, which represents the ratio of total debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, to total capitalization (total debt plus total shareholders equity), improved to 10% at the end of fiscal 2006, compared with 12% at the end of fiscal 2005. The improvement was due primarily to an increase in shareholders equity. We view our debt-to-capitalization ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness. Our adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by eight), was 49% at the end of fiscal 2006, compared with 51% at the end of fiscal 2005.
Our adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and is not in accordance with, or preferable to, the ratio determined in accordance with GAAP. However, we have included this information as we believe that our adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is important for understanding our operations and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our long-term debt and other fixed obligations, and to fund our future growth. In addition, we believe our adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to retailers who own, rather than lease, their stores. Our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to own or to lease the location, the owners desire to own or to lease the location and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders.
The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to our adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations, is our debt-to-capitalization ratio. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio excludes capitalized operating lease obligations in both the numerator and denominator of the calculation in the table below.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of our adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations ($ in millions): FiscalYear 2006 2005 Debt (including current portion) $ 596 $ 600 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8   times rental expense) 4,413 4,007 Total debt (including capitalized operating   lease obligations) $ 5,009 $ 4,607 Debt (including current portion) $ 596 $ 600 Capitalized operating lease obligations (8   times rental expense) 4,413 4,007 Total shareholders equity 5,257 4,449 Adjusted capitalization $ 10,266 $ 9,056 Debt-to-capitalization ratio 10 % 12 % Adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio (including   capitalized operating lease obligations) 49 % 51 % 42 Contractual Obligations The following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations by fiscal year ($ in millions): PaymentsDuebyPeriod ContractualObligations Total LessThan 1Year 1-3Years 3-5Years MoreThan 5Years Long-term debt obligations $ 412 $ 403 $  $ 9 $  Capital lease obligations 27 3 6 4 14 Financing lease obligations 157 12 26 29 90 Interest payments 280 24 46 41 169 Operating lease obligations (1) 5,928 602 1,187 1,059 3,080 Purchase obligations (2) 1,968 1,141 454 347 26 Deferred compensation (3)      Total $ 8,772 $ 2,185 $ 1,719 $ 1,489 $ 3,379 Note: For additional information refer to Note 4, Debt ; Note 7, Leases ; and Note 11, Contingencies and Commitments , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
(1) Operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. These charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by $1.5billion as of February25, 2006.
(2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they are not legally binding agreements, we included open purchase orders in the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days.
(3) Included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at February25, 2006, is a $74 million obligation for deferred compensation. As the specific payment dates for the deferred compensation are unknown, related balances have not been reflected in the above table.
43 Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board.
Description Judgments    and Uncertainties Effect    if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Inventory Reserves We value our   inventory at the lower of the average cost of the inventory or fair market   value through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss reserves.
Our markdown reserve   represents the excess of the carrying value, typically average cost, over the   amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the   inventory. Markdowns establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent   changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the restoration of previously   recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis.
Our inventory loss   reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) that   have occurred since the last physical inventory date. Independent physical   inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure the inventory   reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated. During   the interim period between physical inventory counts, we reserve for   anticipated physical inventory losses on a location-by-location   basis.
Our markdown reserve   contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make   assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted   consumer demand, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence.
Our inventory loss   reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to   make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors,   including historical results and current inventory loss trends.
We have not made any   material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our markdown   or inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years.
We do not believe   there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the   future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdown reserve.   However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in   technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may   be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in our   actual markdown reserve at February25, 2006, would have affected net   earnings by approximately $3million for the fiscal year ended   February25, 2006.
We do not believe   there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the   future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss   reserve. However, if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are   inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A   10% difference in actual physical inventory losses reserved for at   February25, 2006, would have affected net earnings by approximately   $5million for the fiscal year ended February25, 2006.
44 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results    Differ From Assumptions Long-Lived Assets Long-lived   assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,   which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment   whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value   may not be recoverable.
When evaluating long-lived   assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the   asset to the assets estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest   charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value   of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss   calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated   fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and   with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the   assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value. If we   recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset   becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new   cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of   that asset.
Using the impairment   evaluation methodology described herein, we recorded long-lived asset   impairment charges totaling $4million, in the aggregate, during the   fiscal year ended February25, 2006.
Our impairment loss   calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make   assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset   fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting   the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
We have not made any   material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the   past three fiscal years.
We do not believe   there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the   estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset   impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our   estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair   values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
45 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ    From Assumptions Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill   and the Future Shop tradename for impairment annually and whenever events or   changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or the   Future Shop tradename may not be recoverable. We complete our impairment   evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other   publicly available market information and using an independent valuation   firm.
In the fourth   quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed our annual impairment testing of   goodwill and the Future Shop tradename using the methodology described   herein, and determined there was no impairment.
The carrying value   of goodwill as of February25, 2006, was $557million. The carrying   value of the Future Shop tradename as of February25, 2006, was $44   million.
We determine fair   value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash   flow and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses contain   uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to   apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of   future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing   based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and   economic conditions, as well as future expectations.
We have not made any   material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the   past three fiscal years.
We do not believe   there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the   future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment   losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and   assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be   material.
We do not believe   there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the   future estimates or assumptions we use to test for Future Shop tradename   impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our   estimates and assumptions, or if we ever were to discontinue the use of the   Future Shop tradename as a result of abandoning our dual-branding   strategy in Canada or otherwise, we may be exposed to an impairment charge   that could be material.
Tax Contingencies Our income tax   returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic   and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax   filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the   allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time,   multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In   evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we   record reserves for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a   particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and   fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and   income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement   with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of   limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax   position or when more information becomes available.
Our tax   contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required   to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures   associated with our various filing positions.
Our effective income   tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new   stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax   audits.
Although management   believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable,   actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that   could be material.
To the extent we   prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required   to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a   given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable   tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our   effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax   settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax   rate in the period of resolution.
46 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results    Differ From Assumptions Revenue Recognition See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ,   to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on   Form10-K, for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition   policies.
We have a customer loyalty   program which allows members to earn points for each purchase completed at   U.S. Best Buy stores or through our BestBuy.com Web site. Points earned   enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future   purchases at U.S. Best Buy stores. The value of points earned by our loyalty   program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a   reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the retail   value of points that are projected to be redeemed.
We offer rebates   that entitle our customers to receive a reduction in the price of a product   or service. Rebates are recorded as a reduction in revenue based on the   percentage of rebates that are projected to be redeemed.
Our revenue   recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires   management to make assumptions regarding and to apply judgment to estimate   the amount and timing of points projected to be redeemed by members of our   customer loyalty program and rebate offers projected to be redeemed by   customers. Our estimate of the amount and timing of points and rebates   projected to be redeemed is based primarily on historical transaction   experience.
We have not made any   material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize revenue for   our customer loyalty and rebate programs during the past three fiscal years.
We do not believe   there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the   future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue for our customer   loyalty and rebate programs. However, if actual results are not consistent   with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that   could be material.
A 10% change in our   customer loyalty and rebate program liabilities at February25, 2006,   would have affected net earnings by approximately $5 million and   $5million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended February25,   2006.
Costs Associated With Exit Activities We occasionally   vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related   lease. For vacated locations that are under long-term leases, we record   an expense for the difference between our future lease payments and related   costs (e.g., real estate taxes and common area maintenance) from the date of   closure through the end of the remaining lease term, net of expected future   sublease rental income.
Our estimate of   future cash flows is based on historical experience; our analysis of the   specific real estate market, including input from independent real estate   firms; and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Cash flows   are discounted using a risk-free interest rate that coincides with the   remaining lease term.
Our location closing   liability contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions   and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods, the   amount and timing of future settlement payments, and the amount and timing of   potential sublease rental income. When making these assumptions, management   considers a number of factors, including historical settlement experience,   the owner of the property, the location and condition of the property, the   terms of the underlying lease, the specific marketplace demand and general   economic conditions.
We have not made any   material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our location   closing liability during the past three fiscal years.
We do not believe   there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the   estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability.   However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or   assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
A 10% change in our   location closing liability at February25, 2006, would have affected net   earnings by approximately $3million for the fiscal year ended   February25, 2006.
47 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results    Differ From Assumptions Stock-Based Compensation We have a   stock-based compensation plan, which includes non-qualified stock options and   nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , and Note 5, Shareholders Equity , to the Notes to Consolidated   Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial   Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form10-K, for a   complete discussion of our stock-based compensation programs.
W e determine   the fair value of our non-qualified stock option awards at the date of grant   using option-pricing models. Non-qualified stock option awards granted prior   to fiscal 2006 were valued using a Black-Scholes model. Non-qualified stock   option awards granted in fiscal 2006 were primarily valued using a lattice   model.
We determine the   fair value of our market-based and performance-based nonvested share awards   at the date of grant using generally accepted valuation techniques and the   closing market price of our stock.
Management reviews   its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party   valuation advisors to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation   awards.
Option-pricing   models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make   assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards.   These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of   our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and   future employee stock option exercise behaviors. Changes in these assumptions   can materially affect the fair value estimate.
Performance-based   nonvested share awards require management to make assumptions regarding the   likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals.
We do not believe   there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the   future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock-based compensation   expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or   assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock-based compensation expense   that could be material.
If actual results   are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock-based compensation   expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the   actual economic cost of the stock-based compensation.
A 10% change in our   stock-based compensation expense for the year ended February25, 2006,   would have affected net earnings by approximately $9 million for the fiscal   year ended February25, 2006.
Self-Insured Liabilities We are self-insured   for certain losses related to health, workers compensation and general   liability claims. However, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to   limit our exposure to these claims.
When estimating our   self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including   historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and   valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries.
Periodically,   management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent   third-party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self-insured   liabilities.
Our self-insured   liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make   assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle   reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet   date.
We have not made any   material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insured   liabilities during the past three fiscal years.
We do not believe   there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the   estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self-insured   liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates   or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
A 10% change in our   self-insured liabilities at February25, 2006, would have affected   net earnings by approximately $6million for the fiscal year ended   February25, 2006.
48 New Accounting Standards In October2005, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP) No.FAS 13-1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period . FSP No.FAS 13-1 requires companies to expense rent payments for building or ground leases incurred during the construction period. FSP No.FAS 13-1 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2005. Retrospective application is permitted, but not required. We will adopt FSP No.FAS 13-1 on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption of this new standard will have a significant effect on operating income or net earnings.
Outlook for Fiscal 2007 Our outlook for fiscal 2007 is based on information presently available and contains certain assumptions regarding future economic conditions. Differences in actual economic conditions compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our fiscal 2007 results. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors , of this Annual Report on Form10-K for additional important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those contemplated by the following forward-looking statements.
Looking forward to fiscal 2007, we are projecting net earnings in a range of $2.65 to $2.80 per diluted share. We expect the earnings growth to be driven primarily by an increase in revenue of 10 percent to 13 percent, a slight improvement in our gross profit rate, and a decrease in our SG&A rate. This guidance includes anticipated severance and related reorganization costs of $0.03 to $0.05 per diluted share in the first half of fiscal 2007. These costs are directly related to our efforts to increase productivity and redeploy resources to implement a simple, customer-centric operating model. We estimate that our net interest income, as a percent of revenue, will remain relatively stable for fiscal 2007, compared with fiscal 2006. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2007 is projected to be approximately 35%.
We are forecasting revenue of $34.0 billion to $35.0 billion for fiscal 2007, compared with revenue of $30.8 billion for fiscal 2006. We expect the opening of nearly 90 new stores will drive the revenue growth. For the fiscal year, we are projecting an increase in comparable store sales of 3% to 5%. Additionally, our fiscal 2007 reporting period includes 53 weeks. We estimate an additional week of business adds, on average, approximately $0.05 per diluted share, which is reflected in the guidance above.
Our fiscal 2007 outlook assumes an improvement in our operating income rate of approximately 0.4% of revenue, due mainly to reducing our SG&A rate by 0.3% of revenue to 0.4% of revenue as we refine our operating model.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 are expected to be $675 to $725 million, excluding expenditures associated with acquiring Pacific Sales and any additional acquisitions. Of that total, we expect approximately $450 million will support our planned new-store openings and various store remodeling projects, including the costs of converting additional stores to our customer centricity model. Specifically, the capital expenditures are expected to support the opening of 75 to 80 new U.S. Best Buy stores, approximately three Canadian Best Buy stores and four to five Future Shop stores. We anticipate relocating 10 to 15 U.S. Best Buy stores and approximately four Future Shop stores, and expect to remodel and enhance existing stores as usual. As part of our customer centricity initiative, stores scheduled for updating typically receive new fixtures, expanded product assortments and changes in the staffing model. We also plan to enhance our home theater experience by expanding the assortment of digital TVs and continuing to add Magnolia Home Theater store-within-a-store concepts, which we view as a differentiated solution for customers. Finally, we plan to add elements of our Best Buy For Business experience to at least 120 U.S. Best Buy stores in fiscal 2007.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 also are expected to include approximately $250 million in technology investments intended to, among other things, improve our customer service capabilities and increase our operating efficiencies.
During fiscal 2007, we plan to continue with our quarterly cash dividend program. We will continue to evaluate the amount of our quarterly dividend based on our strong cash and short-term investments position at the end of fiscal 2006, and our cash flows generated during fiscal 2007.
We also expect to continue repurchasing our common stock during fiscal 2007 pursuant to a $1.5 billion share 49 repurchase program authorized by our Board in April2005. There is no stated expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases.
We are revising our earnings guidance practices and plan to continue providing annual guidance, including revenue and earnings per share expectations. We will no longer provide a specific forecast for quarterly earnings per share, which is consistent with managements focus on long-term revenue and earnings growth generation. We dont expect the quarterly seasonality of our business to change, and anticipate that on a separate basis, each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2007 will contribute 12% to 15% of the years earnings.
We intend to update our annual earnings guidance when we are reasonably confident that annual results are expected to change materially.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Our debt is not subject to material interest-rate volatility risk. The rates on a substantial portion of our debt may be reset, but not more than one percentage point higher than the current rates. If the rates on the debt were to be reset one percentage point higher, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $4 million. We do not manage our debt interest-rate volatility risk through the use of derivative instruments.
We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our operations in Canada. A 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rate would not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position. We do not manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of derivative instruments.
Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect interest income generated from our short-term and long-term investments in debt securities. If overall interest rates were one percentage point lower than current rates, our annual interest income would decline by approximately $32 million based on our short-term and long-term investments as of February25, 2006. We do not manage our investment interest-rate volatility risk through the use of derivative instruments.
Overall, there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year. We do not expect any material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks for the foreseeable future.
50 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Managements Report on the Financial Statements Our management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related financial information. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and necessarily include certain amounts that are based on estimates and informed judgments. Our management also prepared the related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form10-K and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Deloitte& Touche LLP for the year ended February25, 2006, and by Ernst& Young LLP for the years ended February26, 2005 and February28, 2004, independent registered public accounting firms who conducted their audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The independent registered public accounting firms responsibility is to express an opinion as to the fairness with which such financial statements present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15(f)under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include those policies and procedures that: (1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) Provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and Board of Directors; and (3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February25, 2006, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February25, 2006. During its assessment, management did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte& Touche LLP, the independent registered accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements for the year ended February25, 2006, included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form10-K, has issued an unqualified attestation report on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting.
Bradbury H.   Anderson Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) Darren R.   Jackson Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer) 51 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Shareholders and Board of Directors Best Buy Co.,Inc.
We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Best Buy Co.,Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February25, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February25, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February25, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended February25, 2006, of the Company and our report dated May5, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the Companys change effective February27, 2005, in its method of accounting for share-based payments.

An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

58 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements $ in millions, except per share amounts 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Best Buy Co.,Inc. is a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home-office products, entertainment software, appliances and related services, with fiscal 2006 revenue from continuing operations of $30.8billion.
We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations of U.S. Best Buy, Magnolia Audio Video and U.S. Geek Squad. U.S. Best Buy stores offer a wide variety of consumer electronics, home-office equipment, entertainment software, appliances and related services through 742 stores in 49 states and the District of Columbia at the end of fiscal 2006. Magnolia Audio Video stores offer high-end audio and video products and related services through 20 stores in California, Washington and Oregon at the end of fiscal 2006. U.S. Geek Squad offers computer repair, support and installation services in all U.S. Best Buy stores and at 12 stand-alone stores at the end of fiscal 2006.
The International segment was established in connection with our acquisition of Future Shop in fiscal 2002. At the end of fiscal 2006, the International segment operated 118 Future Shop stores throughout all Canadian provinces and 44 Canadian Best Buy stores in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The International segment offers products and services similar to those offered by the Domestic segment, although Canadian Best Buy stores do not sell appliances. Canadian Geek Squad offers computer repair, support and installation services in all Canadian Best Buy stores and five stand-alone stores at the end of fiscal 2006.
Effective March7, 2006, we acquired all of the common stock of Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath Centers,Inc. See Note 13, Subsequent Event, for further details.
In support of our retail store operations, we also maintain Web sites for each of our brands (BestBuy.com, BestBuyCanada.ca, FutureShop.ca, MagnoliaAV.com, GeekSquad.com, GeekSquad.ca and PacificSales.com).
In fiscal 2004, we sold our interest in Musicland Stores Corporation. As described in Note 2, Discontinued Operations , we have classified Musiclands financial results as discontinued operations for all periods presented. These Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, except where otherwise indicated, relate to continuing operations only.
Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Best Buy Co.,Inc. and its subsidiaries.
We have eliminated all intercompany accounts and transactions. All subsidiaries are wholly owned.
On June23, 2005, our Board of Directors (Board) approved a three-for-two stock split. Shareholders of record as of July13, 2005, received one additional share for every two shares owned, with fractional shares being redeemed for cash. The additional shares were distributed on August3, 2005. All share and per share information herein reflect this stock split.
Reclassifications To maintain consistency and comparability, certain amounts from previously reported consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on previously reported operating income or net earnings. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments , and Note 2, Discontinued Operations, for further details of the reclassifications.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Future results could be materially affected if actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions.
59 $ in millions, except per share amounts Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of February. Fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 each included 52 weeks. Fiscal 2007 will include 53 weeks.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash primarily consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market accounts and other highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased. We carry these investments at cost, which approximates market value. The amount of cash equivalents at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, was $350 and $39, respectively, and the weighted-average interest rates were 3.3% and 1.5%, respectively.
Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we classified variable-rate demand notes as cash equivalents. These securities are now classified as short-term investments. Prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current-year presentation. See Note 3, Investments , for further details.
Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit totaled $230 and $393 at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively, and are reflected as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of average cost or market. In-bound freight-related costs from our vendors are included as part of the net cost of merchandise inventories. Also included in the cost of inventory are certain vendor allowances that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs to promote a vendors products. Other costs associated with acquiring, storing and transporting merchandise inventories to our retail stores are expensed as incurred and included in cost of goods sold.
Our inventory loss reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) that have occurred since the last physical inventory date. Independent physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure that the inventory reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated. During the interim period between physical inventory counts, we reserve for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location-by-location basis.
Our markdown reserve represents the excess of the carrying value, typically average cost, over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory. Markdowns establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the restoration of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis.
Restricted Assets Included in other current assets were $178 and $158 in restricted cash balances at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively. Such balances are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for general liability insurance, workers compensation insurance and warranty programs.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period from the date the assets are placed in service to the end of the initial lease term. Leasehold improvements made significantly after the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term, including renewal periods, if reasonably assured. Accelerated depreciation methods are generally used for income tax purposes.
Repairs and maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated.
Costs associated with the acquisition or development of software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the software, from three to seven years. A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to 60 $ in millions, except per share amounts internal-use software is capitalized only to the extent that it enables the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. Capitalized software is included in fixtures and equipment. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period incurred.
Property under master and capital lease is comprised of retail locations under our master lease program, equipment used in our retail stores and other facilities. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we paid off our master lease obligation. Property under our master lease program had a carrying value of $41 at February26, 2005. The related depreciation for master and capital lease assets is included in depreciation expense. Accumulated depreciation for property under master and capital lease was $5 and $23 at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively.
Estimated useful lives by major asset category are as follows: Asset Life (inyears) Buildings 35 Leasehold improvements 525 Fixtures and equipment 320 Property under capital lease 620 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Costs Associated With Exit Activities We account for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , which requires long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, to be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or planned operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or significant changes in our business strategies. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset (if any) are less than the carrying value of the asset. When an impairment loss is recognized, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value based on quoted market prices or other valuation techniques.
We recorded pre-tax asset impairment charges of $4, $22 and $22, in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The impairment charges in fiscal 2006 related to technology and store assets that were taken out of service due to changes in our business. The impairment charges in fiscal 2005 related to technology assets that were taken out of service due to changes in our business and charges associated with the disposal of corporate facilities that had been vacated. The impairment charges in fiscal 2004 related to corporate technology assets that were taken out of service based on changes in our business. Impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) and relate to our Domestic segment operations.
The present value of costs associated with location closings, primarily future lease costs (net of expected sublease income), are charged to earnings when a location is vacated.
Leases We lease portions of our corporate facilities and conduct the majority of our retail and distribution operations from leased locations. The leases require payment of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance, in addition to rent. The terms of our lease agreements generally range from 10 to 20 years. Most of the leases contain renewal options and escalation clauses, and certain store leases require contingent rents based on factors such as specified percentages of revenue or the consumer price index. Other leases contain covenants related to the maintenance of financial ratios.
For leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis from the date we take possession of the property to the end of the initial lease term. We record any difference between the straight-line rent amounts and amounts payable under the leases as part of deferred rent, in accrued liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appropriate.
61 $ in millions, except per share amounts Cash or lease incentives (tenant allowances) received upon entering into certain store leases are recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction to rent from the date we take possession of the property through the end of the initial lease term. We record the unamortized portion of tenant allowances as a part of deferred rent, in accrued liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appropriate.
At February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, deferred rent included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets was $16 and $13, respectively, and deferred rent included in long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets was $211 and $193, respectively.
We capitalize straight-line rent amounts during the major construction phase of leased properties. Straight-line rent is expensed as incurred subsequent to the major construction phase, including the period prior to the store opening. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  New Accounting Standards, for discussion of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP) No.13-1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period, which we will adopt on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
Transaction costs associated with the sale and leaseback of properties and any related gain or loss are recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial period of the lease agreements. Receivables associated with the sale and leaseback of properties are included in other current assets. We do not have any retained or contingent interests in the properties nor do we provide any guarantees in connection with the sale and leaseback of properties, other than a corporate-level guarantee of lease payments.
We also lease certain equipment under noncancelable operating and capital leases. Assets acquired under capital leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term, including renewal periods, if reasonably assured.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method. We do not amortize goodwill but test it for impairment annually, or when indications of potential impairment exist, utilizing a fair value approach at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.
We determine fair values utilizing widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed our annual impairment testing of our goodwill and the Future Shop tradename, using the valuation techniques as described above, and determined there was no impairment.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for continuing operations were as follows: Domestic International Total Balances at March1, 2003 $ 3 $ 426 $ 429 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates  48 48 Balances at February28, 2004 3 474 477 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates  36 36 Balances at February26, 2005 3 510 513 Goodwill resulting from acquisitions 3 1 4 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates  40 40 Balances at February25, 2006 $ 6 $ 551 $ 557 62 $ in millions, except per share amounts Tradename We have an indefinite-lived intangible asset related to our Future Shop tradename that totaled $44 and $40 at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively, which is included in the International segment. The change in the indefinite-lived intangible asset balance from February26, 2005, was the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Lease Rights Lease rights represent costs incurred to acquire the lease of a specific commercial property. Lease rights are recorded at cost and are amortized to rent expense over the remaining lease term, including renewal periods, if reasonably assured. Amortization periods range up to 16 years, beginning with the date we take possession of the property.
The gross cost and accumulated amortization of lease rights were $29 and $27; and $10 and $9, respectively, at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively. Lease rights amortization was $3, $4 and $4 for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Current lease rights amortization is expected to be approximately $3 for each of the next five fiscal years.
Investments Short-term and long-term investments are comprised of municipal and United States government debt securities. In accordance with SFAS No.115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities , and based on our ability to market and sell these instruments, we classify auction-rate debt securities, variable-rate demand notes and other investments in debt securities as available-for-sale and carry them at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Auction-rate debt securities and variable-rate demand notes are bonds that are similar to short-term instruments because their interest rates are reset periodically. Investments in these securities can be sold for cash on the auction date. We classify auction-rate debt securities and variable-rate demand notes as short-term or long-term investments based on the reset dates.
In accordance with our investment policy, we place our investments in debt securities with issuers who have high-quality credit and limit the amount of investment exposure to any one issuer. We seek to preserve principal and minimize exposure to interest-rate fluctuations by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk.
We hold investments in marketable equity securities. We classify all marketable equity securities as available-for-sale. Investments in equity securities are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and reported at fair value, based on quoted market prices when available. All unrealized holding gains are reflected net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity.
We review the key characteristics of our debt and equity securities portfolio and their classification in accordance with GAAP on an annual basis, or when indications of potential impairment exist. If a decline in the fair value of a security is deemed by management to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in the determination of net earnings.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we reclassified variable-rate demand notes from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments for all periods presented. The amortized cost of the securities reclassified for fiscal 2005 was $116.
We also revised the presentation in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended February26, 2005, to reflect the gross purchases and sales of variable-rate demand notes as investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents, which is consistent with the presentation for the fiscal year ended February25, 2006. The amount reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to investing activities was $116 for fiscal 2005. We did not hold any variable-rate demand notes during fiscal 2004.
Insurance We are self-insured for certain losses related to health, workers compensation and general liability claims, although we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims. A portion of these self-insured 63 $ in millions, except per share amounts losses is managed through a wholly owned insurance captive. We estimate our self-insured liabilities using a number of factors including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries. Our self-insurance liability was $83 and $80, at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively, and is included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
Inventory Financing We have inventory financing facilities through which certain suppliers receive payments from a designated finance company on invoices we owe them. Amounts due under the facilities are collateralized by a security interest in certain merchandise inventories. The amounts extended bear interest, if we exceed certain terms, at rates specified in the agreements. We impute interest based on our borrowing rate where there is an average balance outstanding. Imputed interest is not significant. Certain agreements have provisions that entitle the lenders to a portion of the cash discounts provided by the suppliers.
At February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, $59 and $68, respectively, were outstanding and included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets; and $177 and $157, respectively, were available for use under these inventory financing facilities.
Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
In determining our provision for income taxes, we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. The effective income tax rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits. We adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.
Long-Term Liabilities The major components of long-term liabilities at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, included deferred compensation plan liabilities, long-term rent-related liabilities and advances received under vendor alliance programs.
Foreign Currency Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at our consolidated balance sheet date. Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, which are included in SG&A, have not been significant.
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured and the customer takes possession of the merchandise, or in the case of services, at the time the service is provided.
Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue. Revenue is reported net of estimated sales returns and excludes sales taxes.
64 $ in millions, except per share amounts We estimate our sales returns reserve based on historical return rates. We initially established our sales returns reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Our sales returns reserve was $78 and $65, at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively.
We sell extended service contracts on behalf of an unrelated third party. In jurisdictions where we are not deemed to be the obligor on the contract, commissions are recognized in revenue at the time of sale. In jurisdictions where we are deemed to be the obligor on the contract, commissions are recognized in revenue ratably over the term of the service contract.
For revenue transactions that involve multiple deliverables, we defer the revenue associated with any undelivered elements. The fair value of the undelivered elements is determined using the relative fair value of each element, which is generally based on each elements relative retail price.
Gift Cards We sell gift cards to our customers in our retail stores and through our Web sites. Our gift cards do not have an expiration date. We recognize income from gift cards when: (i)the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii)the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and we determine that we do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions. We determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns. Based on our historical information, the likelihood of a gift card remaining unredeemed can be determined 24 months after the gift card is issued. At that time, we recognize breakage income for those cards for which the likelihood of redemption is deemed to be remote. Gift card breakage income is included in revenue in our consolidated statements of earnings.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, based on the resolution of certain legal matters associated with gift card liabilities, we began recognizing gift card breakage income. During fiscal 2006, we recognized $43 of gift card breakage income, of which $27 relates to periods prior to fiscal 2006.
Sales Incentives We frequently offer sales incentives that entitle our customers to receive a reduction in the price of a product or service. Sales incentives include discounts, coupons and other offers that entitle a customer to receive a reduction in the price of a product or service by submitting a claim for a refund or rebate. For sales incentives issued to a customer in conjunction with a sale of merchandise or services, for which we are the obligor, the reduction in revenue is recognized at the time of sale, based on the retail value of the incentive expected to be redeemed.
We have a customer loyalty program which allows members to earn points for each purchase completed at U.S. Best Buy stores or through our BestBuy.com Web site. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases at U.S. Best Buy stores. We account for our customer loyalty program in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.00-22, Accounting for Points and Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based Sales Incentive Offers, and Offers for Free Products or Services to Be Delivered in the Future . The value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned, based on the retail value of points that are projected to be redeemed. Loyalty program membership fees are initially deferred and then recognized in revenue ratably over the membership period.
65 $ in millions, except per share amounts Cost of Goods Sold and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table illustrates the primary costs classified in each major expense category: Cost of Goods Sold SG&A  Total   cost of products sold including: Freight   expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from our vendors to   our distribution centers; Vendor   allowances that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and   identifiable costs to promote a vendors products; Cash   discounts on payments to vendors;  Cost of   services provided;  Physical   inventory losses;  Markdowns;  Customer   shipping and handling expenses;  Costs   associated with operating our distribution network, including payroll and   benefit costs, occupancy costs, and depreciation; and  Freight   expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from our distribution   centers to our retail stores.
Payroll   and benefit costs for retail and corporate employees;  Occupancy   costs of retail, services and corporate facilities;  Depreciation   related to retail, services and corporate assets;  Advertising;  Vendor allowances   that are a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs to   promote a vendors products;  Charitable   contributions;  Outside   service fees;  Long-lived   asset impairment charges; and  Other   administrative costs, such as credit card service fees, supplies, and travel   and lodging.
Vendor Allowances We receive vendor allowances for various programs, primarily volume incentives and reimbursements for specific costs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and sales incentives. Vendor allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an expense reduction when the cost is incurred. All other vendor allowances, including vendor allowances received in excess of our cost to promote a vendors product, are initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventories. The deferred amounts are then included as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related product is sold. Vendor allowances included in revenue for reimbursement of sales incentives were $141, $85 and $51, in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Vendor allowances included in SG&A were $138, $140 and $92, in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Advertising Costs Advertising costs, which are included in SG&A, are expensed the first time the advertisement runs. Advertising costs consist primarily of print and television advertisements as well as promotional events. Gross advertising expenses, before expense reimbursement from vendor allowances, for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $767, $712 and $675, respectively.
Pre-Opening Costs Non-capital expenditures associated with opening new stores are expensed as incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No.123(R) On February27, 2005, we early-adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (123(R)), requiring us to recognize 66 $ in millions, except per share amounts expense related to the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards. We elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS No.123(R). Under this transition method, stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended February25, 2006, includes: (i)compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of February26, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ; and (ii)compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted subsequent to February26, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.123(R). We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award (or to an employees eligible retirement date, if earlier). Total stock-based compensation expense included in our consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal 2006 was $132 ($87, net of tax). In accordance with the modified prospective transition method of SFAS No.123(R), financial results for prior periods have not been restated.
APB Opinion No.25 Prior to February27, 2005, we applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , and related Interpretations in accounting for stock-based compensation awards. Prior to fiscal 2006, no stock-based compensation expense was recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings for non-qualified stock options, as the exercise price was equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant. In addition, we did not recognize any stock-based compensation expense for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), as it was intended to be a plan that qualifies under Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. However, we did recognize stock-based compensation expense for share awards.
Compensation expense for time-based share awards was recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. Compensation expense for market-based share awards was recognized each reporting period based on the current stock price, the number of shares expected to ultimately vest and the vesting period. Outside valuation advisors assisted us in determining the number of shares expected to ultimately vest. If an award recipients relationship with us is terminated, all shares still subject to restrictions are forfeited and returned to the plan.
Stock-based compensation (income) expense recognized in fiscal 2005 and 2004 on a pre-tax basis, was $(1)and $8,respectively. The fiscal 2005 income reflects a change in vesting assumptions based on our total shareholder return relative to the performance of the Standard & Poors 500 Index (S&P 500) and an increase in our expected forfeiture rate.
Transition Prior to the adoption of SFAS No.123(R), we reported all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of non-qualified stock options as operating cash flows in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In accordance with SFAS No.123(R), our fiscal 2006 consolidated statement of cash flows includes the excess tax benefits from the exercise of non-qualified stock options as financing cash flows. For the fiscal year ended February25, 2006, $33 of excess tax benefits was reported as financing cash flows rather than operating cash flows.
In November2005, the FASB issued FSP No.FAS 123(R)-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards . FSP No.FAS 123(R)-3 provides an alternative method of calculating the excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No.123(R). The calculation of excess tax benefits reported as an operating cash outflow and a financing inflow in the statement of cash flows required by FSP No.FAS 123(R)-3 under the alternative method, differs from that required by SFAS No.123(R). We have until November2006 to make a one-time election to adopt the alternative method. We are currently evaluating FSP No.FAS 123(R)-3; however, the one-time election is not expected to affect operating income or net earnings.
67 $ in millions, except per share amounts The table below illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123 to stock-based compensation for fiscal 2005 and 2004.
2005 2004 Net earnings, as reported $ 984 $ 705 Add: Stock-based compensation expense   included in reported net earnings, net of tax (1) (1 ) 5 Deduct: Stock-based compensation   expense determined under fair value method for all awards, net of tax (2) (60 ) (101 ) Net earnings, pro forma $ 923 $ 609 Earnings per share: Basic as reported $ 2.01 $ 1.45 Basic pro forma $ 1.89 $ 1.25 Diluted as reported $ 1.96 $ 1.42 Diluted pro forma $ 1.87 $ 1.25 (1) Amounts represent the stock-based compensation costs, net of tax, recognized under APB Opinion No.25.
(2) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we increased our expected participant non-qualified stock option forfeiture rate as a result of transferring to a third-party provider certain corporate employees, and the departure of certain senior executives. This higher level of expected non-qualified stock option forfeitures reduced our fiscal 2005 pro forma stock-based compensation expense. Fiscal 2005 pro forma stock-based compensation expense may not be indicative of future stock-based compensation expense.
The weighted-average fair value of non-qualified stock options granted during fiscal 2005 and 2004 used in computing pro forma compensation expense was $14.18 and $20.62 per share, respectively.
The fair value of each non-qualified stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: 2005 2004 Risk-free interest rate (1) 3.4% 3.3% Expected dividend yield 0.9% 0.8% Expected stock price volatility (2) 40% 60% Expected life of non-qualified stock options (3) 5.5 years 5.5 years (1) Based on the five-year Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of our non-qualified stock options.
(2) Beginning in fiscal 2005, we used an outside valuation advisor to assist us in projecting the expected stock price volatility. We considered both historical data and observable market prices of similar equity instruments. Prior to fiscal 2005, expected stock price volatility was based primarily on historical experience.
(3) We estimated the expected life of non-qualified stock options based upon historical experience.
68 $ in millions, except per share amounts Derivative Financial Instruments Our only derivative financial instrument was an interest-rate swap with a fair value of $1 as of February26, 2005. On May2, 2005, we terminated the interest-rate swap. Our interest-rate swap was included in our consolidated balance sheet in the current portion of long-term debt.
New Accounting Standards In October2005, the FASB issued FSP No.FAS 13-1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period . FSP No.FAS 13-1 requires companies to expense rent payments for building or ground leases incurred during the construction period. FSP No.FAS 13-1 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2005. Retrospective application is permitted, but not required. We will adopt FSP No.FAS 13-1 on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption of this new standard will have a significant effect on operating income or net earnings.
2.
Discontinued Operations In fiscal 2004, we sold our interest in Musicland. The buyer assumed all of Musiclands liabilities, including approximately $500 in lease obligations, in exchange for all of the capital stock of Musicland and paid no cash consideration. The transaction also resulted in the transfer of all of Musiclands assets, other than a distribution center in Franklin, Indiana, and selected nonoperating assets. The loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2004 included a loss on the disposal of discontinued operations (which was primarily noncash) of $66, net of tax, related to the sale of Musicland. In connection with the sale, Musicland purchased transition support services from us for approximately one year from the date of the sale.
On March25, 2005, we received notification from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a favorable resolution of outstanding tax matters regarding the disposition of our interest in Musicland. Based on the agreement with the IRS,we reversed previously recorded valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to the disposition of our interest in Musicland and recognized a $50 tax benefit in fiscal 2005.
In accordance with SFAS No.144, Musiclands financial results are reported separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
No assets or liabilities of Musicland were included in our consolidated balance sheets at February25, 2006, or February26, 2005.
In fiscal 2006, we have separately disclosed the operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows attributable to our discontinued operations, which in prior periods were reported on a combined basis as a single amount.
The financial results of Musicland, included in discontinued operations, were as follows: FortheFiscalYearsEnded Feb.25, 2006 Feb.26, 2005 Feb.28, 2004 (1) Revenue $  $  $ 354 Loss before income taxes   (46 ) Loss before the disposal and the cumulative   effect of accounting changes, net of $17tax   (29 ) Gain (loss) on disposal of discontinued   operations (2)  50 (66 ) Gain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $  $ 50 $ (95 ) (1) Fiscal 2004 includes operating results from March2, 2003, through June16, 2003, the date we sold our interest in Musicland.
(2) The fiscal 2005 gain on disposal of discontinued operations represents the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets as described above. The fiscal 2004 loss on disposal of discontinued operations is net of $25 tax benefit offset by a $25 valuation allowance.
69 $ in millions, except per share amounts 3. Investments Debt Securities The following table presents the amortized principal amounts, related weighted-average interest rates, maturities and major security types for our investments in debt securities: Feb.25,2006 Feb.26,2005 Amortized Principal Amount Weighted- Average InterestRate Amortized Principal Amount Weighted- Average InterestRate Short-term investments (less than one   year) $ 3,051 4.76% $ 2,994 3.20% Long-term investments (one to three   years) 218 4.95% 148 3.73% Total $ 3,269 $ 3,142 Municipal debt securities $ 3,262 $ 3,135 Debt securities issued by U.S. Treasury and   other U.S.governmententities 7 7 Total $ 3,269 $ 3,142 The carrying value of our investments in debt securities approximated fair value at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, due to the rapid turnover of our portfolio and the highly liquid nature of these investments. Therefore, there were no significant realized or unrealized gains or losses.
Marketable Equity Securities The carrying value of our investments in marketable equity securities at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, was $28 and $8, respectively. Unrealized gains, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income were $12 and $2 at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively.
Prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2006, our investments included redeemable convertible preferred stock of Golf Galaxy,Inc., with a $5 carrying value. In August2005, Golf Galaxy completed an initial public offering (IPO) of its common stock. As part of the IPO, we received $4 of accumulated preferred dividends, which are included in net interest income for fiscal 2006. The convertible preferred stock was simultaneously converted into 1,492,000 shares of common stock. In August2005, we sold 216,000 shares of the common stock in the IPO and recognized a $2 gain on the sale, which is included in SG&A.
70 $ in millions, except per share amounts 4. Debt Long-term debt consists of the following: Feb.25, 2006 Feb.26, 2005 Convertible subordinated debentures,   unsecured, due 2022, initial interest rate 2.25% $ 402 $ 402 Financing lease obligations, due 2009 to   2026, interest rates ranging from 3.0% to 6.1% 157 107 Capital lease obligations, due 2007 to   2026, interest rates ranging from 1.8% to 8.9% 27 13 Other debt, due 2010, interest rates   ranging from 8.4% to 8.8% 10 23 Master lease obligations, due 2006,   interest rate 5.9%  55 Total debt 596 600 Less: current   portion (1) (418 ) (72 ) Total long-term debt $ 178 $ 528 (1) Since holders of our debentures due in 2022 may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January15, 2007, we have classified our debentures in the current portion of long-term debt at February25, 2006.
Lease obligations and other debt are secured by certain property and equipment with a net book value of $41 and $98 at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively.
Convertible Debentures In January2002, we sold convertible subordinated debentures having an aggregate principal amount of $402. The proceeds from the offering, net of $6 in offering expenses, were $396. The debentures mature in 2022 and are callable at par, at our option, for cash on or after January15, 2007.
Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January15, 2007; January15, 2012; and January15, 2017, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the date of purchase. We have the option to settle the purchase price in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. Since holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January15, 2007, we have classified our debentures in the current portion of long-term debt at February25, 2006.
The debentures will be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 21.7391 shares per $0.001 principal amount of debentures, equivalent to an initial conversion price of $46.00 per share, if the closing price of our common stock exceeds a specified price for 20 consecutive trading days in a 30-trading day period preceding the date of conversion, if our credit rating falls below specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur. At February25, 2006, none of the criteria for conversion had been met. Since March31, 2006, our closing stock price has exceeded the specified stock price for more than 20 days, therefore, holders currently have the option to convert their debentures into our common stock. As of May9, 2006, no debentures had been converted to shares of our common stock.
The debentures have an initial interest rate of 2.25% per annum. The interest rate may be reset, but not below 2.25% or above 3.25%, on July15, 2006; July15, 2011; and July15, 2016. One of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the convertible debentures.
Credit Facilities We have a $200 bank revolving credit facility which is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. The facility expires on December22, 2009. Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates specified in the credit agreement. We also pay certain facility and agent fees. The agreement contains covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios. This facility replaced a 71 $ in millions, except per share amounts $200 revolving credit facility that would have expired on March21, 2005. At February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, $199 and $139, respectively, were available under these facilities. There were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities for any period presented. However, amounts outstanding under letters of credit reduce amounts available under these facilities.
Our International segment has a $22 revolving demand facility, of which $17 is available from Februarythrough Julyand $22 is available from Augustthrough Januaryof each year. There is no set expiration date for this facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at February25, 2006, or February26, 2005. Outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee reduced the amount available under this facility to $17 and $15 at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively. All borrowings under this facility are made available at the sole discretion of the lender and are payable on demand. Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates specified in the agreement. The agreement for this facility contains certain reporting and operating covenants.
Other The fair value of long-term debt approximated $693 and $603 at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively, based on the ask prices quoted from external sources, compared with carrying values of $596 and $600, respectively.
We had a master lease program which was used to construct and lease new retail locations. At the end of fiscal 2005, $55 in leases for new stores was outstanding under the master lease program. At February26, 2005, the debt associated with the master lease program was included in the current portion of long-term debt based on the terms of the agreement. On May4, 2005, we repaid the outstanding balance of $54 on our master lease obligation.
The future maturities of long-term debt, including capitalized leases, consist of the following: FiscalYear 2007 (1) $ 418 2008 16 2009 16 2010 25 2011 17 Thereafter 104 $ 596 (1) Holders of our debentures due in 2022 may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January15, 2007. The table above assumes that all holders of our debentures exercise their redemption options.
5.
Shareholders Equity Stock Compensation Plans Our 2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (Omnibus Plan) authorizes us to grant or issue non-qualified stock options, nonvested share awards and other equity awards up to a total of 24 million shares. Under the terms of the Omnibus Plan, awards may be granted to our employees, officers, advisors, consultants and directors. Awards issued under the Omnibus Plan vest as determined by our Compensation and Human Resources Committee at the time of grant. At February25, 2006, a total of 11.4 million shares were available for future grants under the Omnibus Plan.
Upon shareholder approval of the Omnibus Plan, all of our previous stock compensation plans were terminated. However, existing awards under those plans will continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedule and will expire at the end of their original term.
Our outstanding non-qualified stock options have a 10-year term. Outstanding non-qualified stock options issued to employees generally vest over a four-year period, and outstanding non-qualified stock options issued to directors vest immediately upon grant. Share awards vest based either upon attainment of established goals or upon continued employment (time-based). Outstanding share awards that are not time-based vest at the end of a three-year incentive period based either upon our total 72 $ in millions, except per share amounts shareholder return (TSR) compared with the TSR of companies that comprise the S&P 500 (market-based), or upon the achievement of company or personal performance goals (performance-based). Time-based share awards vest over a period of at least three years, during which no more than 25% may vest at the time of the award, and no more than 25% may vest on each anniversary date thereafter. Stock-based compensation expense associated with our performance-based and time-based share awards is not significant.
We also have an employee stock purchase plan which permits employees to purchase stock at 85% of the market price of our common stock at the beginning or at the end of the semi-annual purchase period, whichever is less.
Non-Qualified Stock Options Non-qualified stock option activity for fiscal 2006 was as follows: Non-Qualified Stock Options Weighted- Average ExercisePrice perShare Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term(inyears) Aggregate IntrinsicValue Outstanding on February26, 2005 37,752,000 $ 28.43 Granted 5,752,000 46.04 Exercised (9,804,000 ) 26.42 Forfeited/Canceled (1,366,000 ) 34.22 Outstanding on February25, 2006 32,334,000 $ 31.93 6.57 $ 715 Exercisable on February25, 2006 19,576,000 $ 26.60 5.22 $ 537 The weighted-average grant-date fair value of non-qualified stock options granted during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $18.54, $14.18 and $20.62, respectively, per share. The aggregate intrinsic value of our non-qualified stock options (the amount by which the market price of the stock on the date of exercise exceeded the exercise price of the option) exercised during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, was $197, $156 and $111, respectively. At February25, 2006, there was $163 of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-qualified stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.
Prior to fiscal 2006, we used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of each non-qualified stock option. For grants subsequent to our adoption of SFAS No.123(R), we estimate the fair value of each non-qualified stock option using a lattice model. We believe the lattice model more accurately estimates stock-based compensation expense as it incorporates additional variables, including historical exercise behavior.
73 $ in millions, except per share amounts The fair value of each non-qualified stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice model in fiscal 2006 and the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in fiscal 2005 and 2004, with the following assumptions: ValuationAssumptions (1) Feb.25, 2006 Lattice Feb.26, 2005 Black-Scholes Feb.28, 2004 Black-Scholes Risk-free interest rate (2) 4.3% - 4.6% 3.4% 3.3% Expected dividend yield 0.8% 0.9% 0.8% Expected stock price volatility (3) 40% 40% 60% Expected life of non-qualified stock   options (in years) (4) 6.1 5.5 5.5 (1) Forfeitures are estimated using historical experience and projected employee turnover.
(2) Based on the Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of our non-qualified stock options.
(3) Beginning in fiscal 2005, we use an outside valuation advisor to assist us in projecting expected stock price volatility. We consider both the historical volatility of our stock price as well as implied volatilities from exchange-traded options on our stock. Prior to fiscal 2005, expected stock price volatility was based primarily on historical experience.
(4) We estimate the expected life of non-qualified stock options based upon historical experience.
Net cash proceeds from the exercise of non-qualified stock options were $257, $220 and $114 for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The actual income tax benefit realized from non-qualified stock option exercises totaled $53, $59 and $41, for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Market-Based Share Awards The fair value of market-based share awards is determined based on generally accepted valuation techniques and the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant. A summary of the status of our market-based nonvested share awards at February25, 2006, and changes during fiscal 2006, is as follows: Market-BasedNonvestedShareAwards Shares Fair Value Outstanding at February26, 2005 2,297,000 $ 29.20 Granted 654,000 34.12 Vested   Forfeited/Canceled (273,000 ) 29.57 Outstanding at February25, 2006 2,678,000 $ 30.36 Market-based share awards were first granted in fiscal 2004. No market-based share awards vested during fiscal 2006 or 2005. At February25, 2006, there was $33 of unrecognized compensation expense related to market-based nonvested share awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.
74 $ in millions, except per share amounts ESPP The fair value of stock-based compensation expense associated with our ESPP was estimated on the purchase date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model, with the following assumptions: ValuationAssumptions Feb.25, 2006 Feb.26, 2005 Feb.28, 2004 Risk-free interest rate (1) 3.5% 1.5% 1.0% Expected dividend yield 0.8% 0.8% 0.0% Expected stock price volatility (2) 32% 31% 39% Expected life of ESPP options (in months) (3) 6 6 6 (1) Based on the Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of ESPP shares.
(2) Beginning in fiscal 2005, we use an outside valuation advisor to assist us in projecting expected stock price volatility. We consider both the historical volatility of our stock price as well as implied volatilities from exchange-traded options on our stock. Prior to fiscal 2005, expected stock price volatility was based primarily on historical experience.
(3) Based on semi-annual purchase period.
In fiscal 2006 and 2005, 1.1 million and 1.2 million shares were purchased through the ESPP. The weighted-average purchase date fair value of ESPP shares purchased during fiscal 2006 and 2005, was $9.13 and $8.50, respectively. At February 25, 2006, and February 26, 2005, ESPP participants had accumulated approximately $18 and $13, respectively, to purchase our common stock. There were no shares purchased through the ESPP during fiscal 2004, since the initial purchase period ended on April 1, 2004.
Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding had the potentially dilutive common shares been issued. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock include non-qualified stock options, nonvested share awards and shares issuable under our ESPP, as well as common shares that would have resulted from the assumed conversion of our convertible debentures (see Note 4, Debt ). Since the potentially dilutive shares related to the convertible debentures are included in the calculation, the related interest expense, net of tax, is added back to earnings from continuing operations, as the interest would not have been paid if the convertible debentures were converted to common stock.
At February25, 2006, non-qualified stock options to purchase 32.3 million shares of common stock were outstanding as follows (shares in millions): Exercisable Unexercisable Total Shares % Price Shares % Price Shares % Price In-the-money 19.6 100 $ 26.60 7.4 58 $ 35.35 27.0 84 $ 29.00 Out-of-the-money   NA 5.3 42 46.75 5.3 16 46.75 Total non-qualified stock options outstanding 19.6 100 $ 26.60 12.7 100 $ 40.12 32.3 100 $ 31.93 The computation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes the out-of-the-money non-qualified stock options because such outstanding options exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive (i.e., including such options would result in higher earnings per share).
75 $ in millions, except per share amounts The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004: 2006 2005 2004 Numerator: Earnings from   continuing operations, basic $ 1,140 $ 934 $ 800 Adjustment   for assumed dilution: Interest on   convertible debentures due in 2022, net of tax 7 7 6 Earnings from   continuing operations, diluted $ 1,147 $ 941 $ 806 Denominator (in millions): Weighted-average   common shares outstanding 490.3 488.9 485.0 Effect of   dilutive securities: Shares from   assumed conversion of convertible debentures 8.8 8.8 8.8 Non-qualified   stock options and other 5.7 7.3 7.0 Weighted-average   common shares outstanding, assuming dilution 504.8 505.0 500.8 Basic earnings per share continuing   operations $ 2.33 $ 1.91 $ 1.65 Diluted earnings per share continuing operations $ 2.27 $ 1.86 $ 1.61 Repurchase of Common Stock Our Board authorized a $1,500 share repurchase program in April2005. The program, which became effective on April27, 2005, terminated and replaced a $500 share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June2004. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases under the $1,500 share repurchase program.
During fiscal 2006, we purchased and retired 16.5 million shares at a cost of $711 under the $1,500 share repurchase program, and 1.8 million shares at a cost of $61 under the $500 share repurchase program.
Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is computed as net earnings plus certain other items that are recorded directly to shareholders equity. The significant components of comprehensive income include foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains on available-for-sale marketable equity securities. Foreign currency translation adjustments do not include a provision for income tax expense because earnings from foreign operations are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States.
Comprehensive income was $1,252, $1,047 and $764 for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
6. Net Interest Income (Expense) Net interest income (expense) for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was comprised of the following: 2006 2005 2004 Interest expense (1) $ (30 ) $ (44 ) $ (32 ) Interest income 103 45 23 Dividend income 4   Capitalized interest   1 Net interest income (expense) from continuing operations $ 77 $ 1 $ (8 ) (1) The fiscal 2006 interest expense includes $8 of interest expense related to financing leases. The fiscal 2005 interest expense includes $21 of expense related to our lease accounting corrections. See Note 7, Leases , for additional information.
76 $ in millions, except per share amounts 7. Leases The composition of rental expense for all operating leases, including leases of property and equipment, during the past three fiscal years, was as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Minimum rentals $ 569 $ 516 $ 484 Contingent rentals 1 1 1 Total rent expense from continuing   operations 570 517 485 Less:   sublease income (18 ) (16 ) (17 ) Net rent expense from continuing operations $ 552 $ 501 $ 468 The future minimum lease payments under our capital, financing and operating leases by fiscal year (not including contingent rentals) at February25, 2006, are as follows: FiscalYear Capital Leases Financing Leases Operating Leases 2007 $ 5 $ 20 $ 602 2008 4 20 605 2009 4 20 582 2010 3 20 546 2011 3 20 513 Thereafter 20 113 3,080 Subtotal 39 213 $ 5,928 Less: imputed interest (12 ) (56 ) Present value of lease obligations $ 27 $ 157 Total minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rent income of approximately $88 due under future noncancelable subleases.
During fiscal 2006, we entered into a capital lease agreement totaling $16 for a distribution center. During fiscal 2005, we entered into a capital lease agreement totaling $10 for a corporate facility. During fiscal 2004, we entered into a capital lease agreement totaling $26 for certain equipment used in our stores. These leases were noncash transactions and have been eliminated from our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Fiscal 2005 Lease Accounting Correction We conducted an extensive review of our lease accounting practices during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 in light of the views expressed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its letter dated February7, 2005, to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Center for Public Company Audit Firms. In the letter, the SEC expressed its views regarding operating lease accounting matters and the related interpretation/ application of these matters under existing GAAP.
Following our review, we recorded a cumulative fourth-quarter charge of $36 pre-tax ($23 net of tax) to correct our accounting for certain operating lease matters. Of the $36 pre-tax charge, $15 was recorded as a charge to SG&A, while the remaining $21 was recorded as a charge to interest expense. We determined that no restatement was required due to the immaterial impact of the errors on fiscal 2005 and prior periods.
The $15 charge to SG&A was primarily related to rent holidays. Rent holidays are considered to be any period 77 $ in millions, except per share amounts during which a tenant has the right to control use of the leased property, but rent payments are not required.
Historically, we recognized rent expense beginning at the inception of the contractual lease term, which was generally when the store opened. Effective with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we now recognize rent expense beginning when we take possession of the property unless we are actively constructing the facility in which case straight-line rent amounts are capitalized. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies New Accounting Standards, for a discussion of FSP No.FAS 13-1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period , which we will adopt on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
The $21 charge to interest expense was related to the change in accounting for certain leases as financing leases rather than operating leases, as these leases did not qualify for sale-leaseback treatment in accordance with SFASNo.98, Accounting for Leases: Sale-Leaseback Transactions Involving Real Estate, Sales-Type Leases of Real Estate, Definition of the Lease Term, and Initial Direct Costs of Direct Financing Leases.
For financing leases, the gross cost of constructing the asset is included in property and equipment and amounts reimbursed from the landlord are recorded as financing obligations. In fiscal 2005, we made a $107 adjustment to increase property and equipment, and financing obligations. This adjustment was considered a noncash transaction and has been excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows. Financing obligations are included in our consolidated balance sheets in current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, as appropriate.
In addition, we reclassified certain tenant allowances in our consolidated balance sheet at February26, 2005, from a contra asset in property and equipment to accrued liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appropriate.
These adjustments had no affect on our historical or future cash flows, or the timing of our lease payments.
8. Benefit Plans We sponsor retirement savings plans for employees meeting certain age and service requirements. Participants may choose from various investment options including our company stock. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation annually as defined by the plan document, subject to IRS limitations. We currently match up to 50% of the first 5% of participating employees pre-tax earnings. Our matching contribution is subject to annual approval by our Board. The total matching contributions, net of forfeitures, were $19, $14 and $13 in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
We have a non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for certain management employees and our Board whose contributions are limited under qualified defined contribution plans. Amounts contributed and deferred under the deferred compensation plan are credited or charged with the performance of investment options offered under the plan and elected by the participants. In the event of bankruptcy, the assets of this plan are available to satisfy the claims of general creditors. The liability for compensation deferred under this plan was $74 and $64 at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively, and is included in long-term liabilities. We manage the risk of changes in the fair value of the liability for deferred compensation by electing to match our liability under the plan with investment vehicles that offset a substantial portion of our exposure. The cash value of the investment vehicles, which includes funding for future deferrals, was $78 and $73 at February25, 2006, and February26, 2005, respectively, and is included in other assets. Both the asset and the liability are carried at fair value.
78 $ in millions, except per share amounts 9. Income Taxes The following is a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to income tax expense from continuing operations for the past three fiscal years: 2006 2005 2004 Federal income tax at the statutory rate $ 603 $ 505 $ 454 State income taxes, net of federal benefit 34 29 27 Distributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries   13 Benefit from foreign operations (37 ) (7 ) (3 ) Non-taxable interest income (28 ) (22 ) (19 ) Other 9 4 24 Income tax expense $ 581 $ 509 $ 496 Effective   income tax rate 33.7% 35.3% 38.3% Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. We include our tax contingencies reserve, including accrued penalties and interest, in accrued income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of earnings.
During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we adjusted our tax contingencies reserve based on the resolution and clarification of certain federal and state income tax matters, including favorable rulings from the IRS and certain state jurisdictions. The IRS has completed its audits through fiscal 2002. All tax years since the acquisition of Future Shop in fiscal 2002 are still subject to audit with Revenue Canada.
Income tax expense was comprised of the following for the past three fiscal years: 2006 2005 2004 Current: Federal $ 640 $ 502 $ 456 State 78 36 49 Foreign 14 (1 ) 5 732 537 510 Deferred: Federal (131 ) (4 ) (9 ) State (14 ) (20 ) (1 ) Foreign (6 ) (4 ) (4 ) (151 ) (28 ) (14 ) Income tax expense $ 581 $ 509 $ 496 The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Act) allows U.S. multinational companies a one-time repatriation of accumulated income earned outside the U.S. at an effective income tax rate of 5.25% rather than the normal U.S. income tax rate of 35%, provided that certain criteria, including qualified U.S. reinvestment, are met.
FSP No.FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 , was issued in December2004. This Staff Position provides guidance on accounting for special reductions in taxes included in the Act. FSP No.FAS 109-2 clarifies that a companys consideration of the Act does not overruleits prior contention that the foreign earnings were permanently reinvested. Also, FSP No.FAS 109-2 indicates that companies should recognize tax expense when a decision is made to repatriate some or all foreign earnings, and provide disclosure about the possible range of repatriation if the analysis is not yet complete.
We did not repatriate any foreign income during fiscal 2006, and we do not expect to repatriate any income earned outside the U.S. during fiscal 2007 and, therefore, 79 $ in millions, except per share amounts we have not recorded any income tax expense as a result of the Acts provisions.
We have not provided deferred taxes on unremitted foreign earnings because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Such amounts were not significant.
Deferred taxes are the result of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the dates indicated were comprised of the following: Feb.25, 2006 Feb.26, 2005 Accrued   property expenses $ 87 $ 74 Other accrued   expenses 44 24 Deferred   revenue 139 48 Compensation   and benefits 47 51 Stock-based   compensation 45  Inventory 2 21 Net operating   loss carryforwards 57 47 Goodwill 17 19 Other 36 25 Total deferred tax assets 474 309 Property and   equipment (146 ) (158 ) Convertible   debt (36 ) (27 ) Other (24 ) (5 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (206 ) (190 ) Net deferred   tax assets $ 268 $ 119 Deferred tax assets and liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows: Feb.25, 2006 Feb.26, 2005 Other current assets $ 126 $ 80 Other assets 142 39 Net deferred tax assets $ 268 $ 119 Management believes that the realization of the deferred tax assets is more likely than not, based upon the expectation that we will generate the necessary taxable income in future periods and, accordingly, no valuation reserves have been provided. At February25, 2006, we had net operating loss carryforwards from our International operations of $164, which expire beginning in fiscal 2007 through 2016. We expect to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards and, therefore, no valuation allowances have been recorded.
10. Segments We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of U.S. Best Buy, Magnolia Audio Video and U.S. Geek Squad operations. The International segment is comprised of Future Shop, Best Buy and Geek Squad operations in Canada. Our segments are evaluated on an operating income basis, and a stand-alone tax provision is not calculated for each segment. The other accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
80 $ in millions, except per share amounts The following tables present our business segment information for continuing operations for each of the past three fiscal years: 2006 2005 2004 Revenue Domestic $ 27,380 $ 24,616 $ 22,225 International 3,468 2,817 2,323 Total revenue $ 30,848 $ 27,433 $ 24,548 Percentage of Revenue, by Product Group Domestic: Consumer electronics 43% 39% 38% Home-office 32% 34% 34% Entertainment   software 19% 21% 22% Appliances 6% 6% 6% Total 100% 100% 100% International: Consumer electronics 44% 41% 40% Home-office 38% 40% 40% Entertainment   software 14% 15% 15% Appliances 4% 4% 5% Total 100% 100% 100% Operating Income Domestic $ 1,588 $ 1,393 $ 1,267 International 56 49 37 Total operating income 1,644 1,442 1,304 Net interest income (expense) 77 1 (8 ) Earnings from continuing operations before   income tax expense $ 1,721 $ 1,443 $ 1,296 2006 2005 2004 Assets Domestic $ 9,722 $ 8,372 $ 7,547 International 2,142 1,922 1,105 Total assets $ 11,864 $ 10,294 $ 8,652 Capital Expenditures Domestic $ 541 $ 398 $ 452 International 107 104 93 Total capital expenditures $ 648 $ 502 $ 545 Depreciation Domestic $ 397 $ 413 $ 345 International 59 46 40 Total depreciation $ 456 $ 459 $ 385 81 $ in millions, except per share amounts 11.
Contingencies and Commitments Contingencies On December8, 2005, a purported class action lawsuit captioned, Jasmen Holloway, et. al. v Best Buy Co.,Inc.
, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging we discriminate against women and minority individuals on the basis of gender, race, color and/or national origin with respect to our employment policies and practices. The action seeks an end to discriminatory policies and practices, an award of back and front pay, punitive damages and injunctive relief, including rightful place relief for all class members. We believe the allegations are without merit and intend to defend this action vigorously.
We are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of conducting business. We believe the amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements, as prescribed by GAAP, are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. The resolution of those other proceedings is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
Commitments In 2004, we engaged Accenture LLP to assist us with improving our operational capabilities and reducing our costs in the Human Resources and Information Systems areas. Our future contractual obligations to Accenture are expected to range from $134 to $188 per year through 2011, the end of the contract period for our U.S. operations. Prior to our engagement of Accenture, a significant portion of these costs were incurred as part of normal operations.
We had outstanding letters of credit for purchase obligations with a fair value of $66 at February25, 2006.
At February25, 2006, we had commitments for the purchase and construction of facilities valued at approximately $110. Also, at February25, 2006, we had entered into lease commitments for land and buildings for 96 future locations. These lease commitments with real estate developers provide for minimum rentals ranging from 10 to 20 years, which if consummated based on current cost estimates, will approximate $63 annually over the initial lease terms.
We assumed a liability for certain extended service contracts when we acquired Future Shop in fiscal 2002. We established an accrued liability for the acquired extended service contracts based on historical trends in product failure rates and the expected material and labor costs necessary to provide the services. The remaining terms of these acquired extended service contracts vary by product and extend through fiscal 2007. The estimated remaining liability for acquired extended service contracts at February25, 2006, was $5. Subsequent to the acquisition, all new extended service contracts were sold on behalf of an unrelated third party, without recourse.
The following table reconciles the changes in our liability for our acquired extended service contracts for the years ended February25, 2006, and February26, 2005: Balance at February28, 2004 $ 18 Service charges (10 ) Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation 1 Balance at February26, 2005 9 Service charges (4 ) Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation  Balance February25, 2006 $ 5 12.
Related-Party Transactions Elliot S. Kaplan, a director, is a partner with the law firm of Robins, Kaplan, Miller& Ciresi L.L.P. (RKMC), which serves as our primary outside general counsel. Our Board periodically reviews the fees paid to RKMC to ensure that they are competitive with fees charged by other law firms comparable in size and expertise. We paid legal fees of $7, $6 and $4 to RKMC during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, RKMC earned a contingent fee of $6 in fiscal 2005 in connection with the settlement of our claims against two credit card companies, which we believe resulted in a significantly greater recovery for us than we would have received if we had not opted out of a related class action lawsuit against the same defendants. The Board has approved the transactions and our continued business dealings with RKMC.
We purchase certain store fixtures from Phoenix Fixtures,Inc. (Phoenix), a company owned by the brother of 82 $ in millions, except per share amounts Richard M. Schulze, our Chairman of the Board. The decision to conduct business with Phoenix was based on both qualitative and quantitative factors including product quality, pricing, customer service and design flexibility. Our Board reviewed our transactions with Phoenix and determined that the transactions were at arms-length and that Phoenix provides significant advantages with respect to service and delivery. Accordingly, the Board has approved the transactions and our continued business dealings with Phoenix. The total amount paid to Phoenix during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $18, $20 and $14, respectively.
An independent committee of our Board has responsibility for reviewing related-party transactions.

Subsequent Event Effective March7, 2006, we acquired all of the common stock of Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath Centers,Inc. (Pacific Sales) for $411, or $408, net of cash acquired, including transaction costs. We acquired Pacific Sales, a high-end home-improvement and appliance retailer, to further our expansion plans and increase shareholder value. The acquisition will be accounted for in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 using the purchase method in accordance with SFAS No.141, Business Combinations . Accordingly, the net assets will be recorded at their estimated fair values, and operating results will be included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition. The purchase price will be allocated on a preliminary basis using information currently available. Goodwill is projected to be approximately $390. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired will be finalized no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2008, as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the date of purchase.

Condensed Consolidating Financial Information Our convertible debentures, due in 2022, are guaranteed by our wholly owned indirect subsidiary Best Buy Stores, L.P. Investments in subsidiaries of Best Buy Stores, L.P., which have not guaranteed the convertible debentures, are accounted for under the equity method. We reclassified certain prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year presentation. The aggregate principal balance and carrying amount of our convertible debentures, which mature in 2022, is $402.
Since March31, 2006, our closing stock price has exceeded the specified stock price for more than 20days, therefore, holders currently have the option to convert their debentures into our common stock. As of May9, 2006, no debentures had been converted to shares of our common stock.
Additional information regarding the convertible debentures is included in Note 4, Debt .
In June2004, we redeemed our convertible debentures due in 2021 for $355. These debentures were guaranteed by Best Buy Stores, L.P. and certain of our other wholly owned subsidiaries.
In fiscal 2004, we sold our interest in Musicland. The consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended February28, 2004, includes a loss on disposal of discontinued operations (which was primarily noncash) of $66, net of tax, related to the sale of Musicland. In addition, approximately $198 of Musiclands intercompany indebtedness to Best Buy Co.,Inc. was eliminated in fiscal 2004. This resulted in a loss of $198 that was recorded in Best Buy Co.,Inc. with an offsetting $198 gain recorded in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, which included Musicland. The elimination of intercompany indebtedness had no impact on our consolidated net earnings, financial position or cash flows.
Best Buy Co.,Inc.s fiscal 2005 gain on disposal of discontinued operations includes a $50 tax benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of outstanding tax matters with the IRS regarding the disposition of our interest in Musicland. Additional information regarding Musicland is included in Note 2, Discontinued Operations .
We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Income taxes are allocated in accordance with our tax allocation agreement. U.S. affiliates receive no tax benefit for taxable losses, but are allocated taxes at the required effective income tax rate if they have taxable income.

(1) In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we early-adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123(R), requiring us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards. We elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS No.123(R)and, accordingly, financial results for fiscal years prior to 2006 have not been restated. Stock-based compensation expense for fiscal year 2006 was $132 ($87 net of tax). Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial results for fiscal year 2005 was not significant.
(2) All quarters presented reflect the classification of Musiclands financial results as discontinued operations. Refer to Note2, Discontinued Operations .

(4) The fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 includes a tax benefit of $50 due to the favorable resolution of outstanding tax matters.
(5) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we established a sales return liability which reduced gross profit by $15 pre-tax ($10 net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share). Additionally, following a review of our lease accounting practices, we recorded a cumulative charge of $36 pre-tax ($23 net of tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) to correct our accounting for certain operating lease matters. Of the $36 pre-tax charge, $15 was recorded as a charge to SG&A, while the remaining $21 was recorded as a charge to interest expense.
92 Item9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
On May10, 2005, contemporaneously with the conclusion of the audit for our fiscal year ended February26, 2005, Ernst& Young LLP (E&Y) was dismissed as our independent registered public accounting firm. The dismissal of E&Y was approved by the Audit Committee. The reports of E&Y on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended February26, 2005, and February28, 2004, and on internal control over financial reporting as of February26, 2005, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. In connection with the audits for the fiscal years ended February26, 2005, and February28, 2004, and through the date of dismissal, there were no disagreements with E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused E&Y to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such fiscal years. Also, during those years and through the date of dismissal, there were no reportable events, as such term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v)of Regulation S-K.
Effective February27, 2005, we engaged Deloitte& Touche LLP (D&T) as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2006. The engagement of D&T was approved by the Audit Committee and ratified by our shareholders.
