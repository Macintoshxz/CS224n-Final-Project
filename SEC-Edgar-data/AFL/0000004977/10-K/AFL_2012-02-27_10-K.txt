Aflac Incorporated qualifies as a large accelerated filer within the meaning of Exchange Act Rule12b-2. Our Internet address is aflac.com. The information on the Companys Web site is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form10-K. We make available, free of charge on our Web site, our annual report on Form10-K, quarterly reports on Form10-Q, current reports on Form8-K and amendments thereto as soon as reasonably practicable after those forms have been electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
General Description Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) was incorporated in 1973 under the laws of the state of Georgia. Aflac Incorporated is a general business holding company and acts as a management company, overseeing the operations of its subsidiaries by providing management services and making capital available. Its principal business is supplemental health and life insurance, which is marketed and administered through its subsidiary, American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflacs policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Additionally, Aflac U.S. markets and administers group products through Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC), referred to as Aflac Group Insurance. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business.
Aflac offers voluntary insurance policies in Japan and the United States that provide a layer of financial protection against income and asset loss. We continue to diversify our product offerings in both Japan and the United States. Aflac Japan sells voluntary supplemental insurance products, including cancer plans, general medical indemnity plans, medical/sickness riders, care plans, living benefit life plans, ordinary life insurance plans and annuities. Aflac U.S. sells voluntary supplemental insurance products including loss-of-income products (life and short-term disability plans) and products designed to protect individuals from depletion of assets (hospital indemnity, fixed-benefit dental, vision care, accident, cancer, critical illness/ critical care, and hospital intensive care plans).
We are authorized to conduct insurance business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, several U.S. territories and Japan. Aflac Japans revenues, including realized gains and losses on its investment portfolio, accounted for 75% of the Companys total revenues in 2011 and 2010, compared with 73% in 2009. The percentage of the Companys total assets attributable to Aflac Japan was 87% at December31, 2011, and 86% at December31, 2010.

Insurance Premiums The growth of earned premiums is directly affected by the change in premiums in force and by the change in weighted-average yen/dollar exchange rates. Consolidated earned premiums were $20.4 billion in 2011, $18.1 billion 1 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements in 2010, and $16.6 billion in 2009. For additional information on the composition of earned premiums by segment, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Insurance Products  Japan Aflac Japans insurance products are designed to help consumers pay for medical and nonmedical costs that are not reimbursed under Japans national health insurance system. Changes in Japans economy and an aging population have put increasing pressure on Japans national health care system. As a result, more costs are being shifted to Japanese consumers, who in turn have become increasingly interested in insurance products that help 2 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements them manage those costs. Aflac Japan has responded to this consumer need by enhancing existing products and developing new products.
Aflac Japans product portfolio has expanded beyond traditional health-related products to include more life products. Some of the life products that we offer in Japan provide death benefits and cash surrender values. These products are available as stand-alone policies and riders. Some plans, such as our WAYS product, have features that allow policyholders to convert a portion of their life insurance to medical, nursing care, or fixed annuity benefits at a predetermined age. Our child endowment product offers a death benefit until a child reaches age 18. It also pays a lump-sum benefit at the time of the childs entry into high school, as well as an educational annuity for each of the four years during his or her college education. We believe that life insurance products provide further opportunities for us to sell our third sector cancer and medical products.
Aflac Japans stand-alone medical product, EVER, offers a basic level of hospitalization coverage with an affordable premium. Since its initial introduction in 2002, we have expanded our suite of EVER product offerings to appeal to specific types of Japanese consumers and achieve greater market penetration. New EVER, introduced in 2009, offers enhanced surgical benefits and gender-specific premium rates. The most recent upgrade to our New EVER product, released in January 2012, includes more advanced medical treatment options than its predecessor. Gentle EVER, our non-standard medical product, is designed to meet the needs of certain consumers who cannot qualify for our base EVER plan. We continue to believe that the entire medical category will remain an important part of our product portfolio in Japan.
The cancer insurance plans we offer in Japan provide a lump-sum benefit upon initial diagnosis of internal cancer and a fixed daily benefit for hospitalization and outpatient services related to cancer as well as surgical, convalescent and terminal care benefits. In March 2011, we introduced a new base cancer policy, DAYS, and a bridge policy, DAYS PLUS, which upgrades older cancer policies. The enhancements in this new base policy are a response to the changes in cancer treatment. As the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan, we believe this new product will further strengthen our brand, and most importantly, provide valuable benefits to consumers who are looking for solutions to cancer-related costs. We are convinced that the affordable cancer products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio.
We also offer traditional fixed-income annuities and care policies. For additional information on Aflac Japans products and composition of sales, see the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of MD&A in this report.
Insurance Products  U.S.
We design our U.S. insurance products to provide supplemental coverage for people who already have major medical or primary insurance coverage. Most of our U.S. policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Additionally, we started to market and administer group insurance products in 2009.
Our individually issued policies are portable and pay regardless of other insurance. Benefits are paid in cash directly to policyholders; therefore, our customers have the opportunity to use this cash to help with expenses of their choosing. Our individually issued health insurance plans are guaranteed-renewable for the lifetime of the policyholder (to age 75 for short-term disability policies). Our group insurance policies are underwritten on a group basis and often have some element of guaranteed issue. This coverage is generally not portable, which means the insurance coverage may terminate upon separation from employment or affiliation with the entity holding the group contract or upon termination of the master policy group contract.
Aflac U.S. offers short-term disability benefits on both an individual and group basis.
Aflac U.S. also offers term and whole-life coverage sold through payroll deduction at the worksite on both an individual and group basis and various term and whole-life individual policies on a direct basis.
Aflac U.S. offers accident coverage on both an individual and group basis. These policies are designed to protect against losses resulting from accidents. The accident portion of the policy includes lump-sum benefits for accidental death, dismemberment and specific injuries as well as fixed benefits for hospital confinement. In addition, other benefits such as short-term disability are available as riders.
Aflac U.S. offers coverage for critical illnesses on both an individual and group basis. These policies are designed to protect against losses resulting from critical illnesses such as heart attack, stroke, or even cancer. We offer cancer coverage on an individually underwritten basis; critical illness/critical care policies on both an individual 3 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and group basis; critical care and recovery (formerly called specified health event) on an individual basis; and hospital intensive care plans on an individual basis.
Aflac U.S. offers hospital indemnity coverage on both an individual and group basis. Our hospital indemnity products may provide fixed daily benefits for hospitalization due to accident or sickness, or just sickness alone. Indemnity benefits for inpatient and outpatient surgeries, as well as various other diagnostic expenses, are also available.
Aflac U.S. offers fixed-benefit dental coverage on both an individual and group basis. Aflac U.S. also offers Vision Now SM , an individually issued policy which provides benefits for serious eye health conditions and loss of sight. Vision Now includes coverage for corrective eye materials and exam benefits.
For additional information on Aflacs U.S. products and composition of sales, see the Aflac U.S. Segment subsection of MD&A in this report.
Distribution  Japan The traditional channels through which we have sold our products are independent corporate agencies, individual agencies and affiliated corporate agencies. The independent corporate agencies and individual agencies that sell our products give us better access to workers at a vast number of small businesses in Japan. Agents activities are primarily focused on insurance sales, with customer service support provided by the Aflac Contact Center. Independent corporate agencies and individual agencies contributed 44% of new annualized premium sales in 2011, compared with 51% in 2010 and 55% in 2009. Affiliated corporate agencies are formed when companies establish subsidiary businesses to sell our insurance products to their employees, suppliers and customers. These agencies help us reach employees at large worksites. Affiliated corporate agencies contributed 25% of new annualized premium sales in 2011, compared with 31% in 2010 and 35% in 2009. During 2011, we recruited approximately 5,000 new sales agencies. As of December31, 2011, Aflac Japan was represented by more than 19,700 sales agencies, with more than 120,700 licensed sales associates employed by those agencies. We believe that new agencies will continue to be attracted to Aflac Japans high commissions, superior products, customer service and strong brand image.
We have sold our products to employees of banks since our entry into Japan in 1974. However, December 2007 marked the first time it was permissible for banks to sell our type of insurance products to their customers. By the end of 2011, we had agreements with 370 banks, approximately 90% of the total number of banks in Japan, to sell our products. We have significantly more banks selling our third sector insurance products than any of our competitors. We believe our long-standing and strong relationships within the Japanese banking sector, along with our strategic preparations, have proven to be an advantage as this channel opened up for our products. Banks contributed 29% of Aflac Japan new annualized premium sales in 2011, compared with 15% in 2010 and 6% in 2009.
We continue to reach consumers through our strategic marketing alliance with Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company (Dai-ichi Life). Since its launch in 2001, we have maintained a close relationship with Dai-ichi Life. Dai-ichi Life contributed 2% of Aflac Japan new annualized premium sales in 2011, compared with 3% in 2010 and 4% in 2009.
For additional information on Aflac Japans distribution, see the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of MD&A in this report.
Distribution  U.S.
Our U.S. sales force comprises sales associates and brokers who are independent contractors licensed to sell accident and health insurance. Many are also licensed to sell life insurance. Sales associates and brokers are paid commissions based on first-year and renewal premiums from their sales of insurance products. In addition to receiving commissions on personal production, district, regional and state sales coordinators may also receive override commissions and incentive bonuses. Administrative personnel in Georgia, New York, Nebraska, and South Carolina handle policyholder service functions, including issuance of policies, premium collection, payment notices and claims.
4 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We concentrate on marketing our insurance products at the worksite. This method offers policies to individuals through employment, trade and other associations. Historically, our policies have been individually underwritten with premiums generally paid by the employee. Additionally, Aflacs individual policies are portable, meaning that individuals may retain their full insurance coverage upon separation from employment or such affiliation, generally at the same premium. We collect a major portion of premiums on such sales through payroll deduction or other forms of centralized billing. With our brokerage sales expansion and the purchase of CAIC, branded as Aflac Group Insurance, we are now able to offer group voluntary insurance products desired by many large employers. These products are sold on a group basis and often have some element of guaranteed issue. This coverage is generally not portable, which means the insurance coverage may terminate upon separation from employment or affiliation with the entity holding the group contract. Worksite marketing enables sales associates and brokers to reach a greater number of prospective policyholders and lowers distribution costs, compared with individually marketed business.
During the past several years, we have enhanced and increased the size of our traditional distribution system. We recruited more than 24,400 new sales associates in 2011, a 10.5% increase compared with 2010, resulting in approximately 74,800 licensed sales associates at December31, 2011. To enhance our recruiting results, the bonus structure for our state and regional coordinators incorporates a people development component in addition to sales results. In 2011 and 2010, we held national recruiting contests to incentivize producer recruitment. In addition, we partnered with our field offices for recruiting workshops that focus on improving coordinator productivity by emphasizing candidate sourcing, interviewing, and contract acceptance. However, increasing our sales force means more than just recruiting people. We also focus on growing the number of average weekly producers, which measures high-quality, consistent, capable producers who make solid, consistent contributions to sales.
Insurance brokers have been a historically underleveraged sales channel for Aflac, but in the past several years, we have been developing relationships with brokers that complement our traditional distribution system.We have assembled a management team experienced in broker sales, and we are supporting this initiative with streamlined products, targeted broker-specific advertising campaigns, customized enrollment technology, and competitive compensation.We have more than 100 broker development coordinators who are single points of contact for brokers across the country. Broker development coordinators are responsible for building relationships with new brokers as well as strengthening relationships with our current brokers.These coordinators are assisted by a team of certified case managers whose role is to coordinate and manage the account enrollments for brokers. Aflac Group Insurance equips us with a platform for offering voluntary group insurance products for distribution by insurance brokers at the worksite. Expanding our product portfolio with group products also greatly enhances the sales opportunities for our traditional sales force of individual associates.

Competition  Japan In 1974, Aflac was granted an operating license to sell life insurance in Japan, making Aflac the second non-Japanese life insurance company to gain direct access to the Japanese insurance market. Through 1981, we faced limited competition for cancer insurance policy sales. However, Japan has experienced two periods of deregulation since we entered the market. The first came in the early 1980s, when nine mid-sized insurers, including domestic and foreign companies, were allowed to sell cancer insurance products for the first time. In 2001, all life and non-life insurers were allowed to sell stand-alone cancer and medical insurance products as well as other stand-alone health insurance products. As a result, the number of insurance companies offering stand-alone cancer and medical insurance has more than doubled since the market was deregulated in 2001. However, based on our growth of annualized premiums in force and agencies, we do not believe that our market-leading position has been significantly impacted by increased competition. Furthermore, we believe the continued development and maintenance of operating efficiencies will allow us to offer affordable products that appeal to consumers. Aflac is the largest life insurer in Japan in terms of individual policies in force. As of December31, 2011, we exceeded 21million individual policies in force in Japan.
Aflac has had substantial success selling cancer policies in Japan, with more than 14million cancer policies in force as of December31, 2011. Aflac continued to be the number one seller of cancer insurance policies in Japan 5 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements throughout 2011. We believe we will remain a leading provider of cancer insurance coverage in Japan, principally due to our experience in the market, low-cost operations, unique marketing system (see Distribution  Japan above) and product expertise.
We have also experienced substantial success selling medical insurance in Japan. While other companies have recognized the opportunities that we have seen in the medical insurance market and offered new products, we believe our products stand out for their value to consumers. Aflac Japan continued to be the number one seller of stand-alone medical insurance in the life insurance industry in terms of policy sales in 2011.
In addition to third sector products, Aflac Japan is showing steady progress in sales of life insurance products, such as WAYS which is described in the Products section of this report. The market for ordinary life products is highly competitive. Our current market share of ordinary life sales is relatively small; however, we will continue to pursue the development and marketing of specialty products that meet specific needs within the general life insurance market.
Competition  U.S.
We compete against several insurers on a national basis plus other insurers regionally. We believe our policies and premium rates, as well as the commissions paid to our sales associates and brokers, are competitive with those offered by other companies providing similar types of insurance. However, we believe our U.S. business is distinct from our competitors because of our product focus, distribution system, and brand awareness. For many of the other companies that sell voluntary supplemental insurance, it represents a secondary business. For us, it is our primary business. We also believe that our growing distribution system of independent sales associates and brokers expands our business opportunities, while our advertising campaigns have increased our name awareness and understanding by consumers and businesses of the value our products provide.
Private insurers and voluntary and cooperative plans, such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield, provide major medical insurance for hospitalization and medical expenses. Much of this insurance is sold on a group basis. The federal and state governments also pay substantial costs of medical treatment through various programs. Such major medical insurance generally covers a substantial amount of the medical expenses incurred by an insured as a result of accident and disability, cancer or other major illnesses. Aflacs policies are designed to provide coverage that supplements major medical insurance and may also be used to defray nonmedical expenses. Thus, we do not compete directly with major medical insurers. However, the scope of major medical coverage offered by other insurers does represent a potential limitation on the market for our products. Accordingly, expansion of coverage by other insurers or governmental programs could adversely affect our business opportunities. Conversely, any reduction of coverage, or increased deductibles and copayments, by other insurers or governmental programs could favorably affect our business opportunities.
Investments and Investment Results Net investment income was $3.3 billion in 2011, $3.0 billion in 2010 and $2.8 billion in 2009. In each of these three years, net investment income benefited from the strengthening of the yen/dollar exchange rate. The growth rate however has been negatively impacted by the low level of investment yields for new money in both Japan and the United States. In particular, Japans life insurance industry has contended with low investment yields for a number of years. For information on our investments and investment results, see the Insurance Operations and Analysis of Financial Condition sections of MD&A and Notes 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.
Regulation  Japan The financial and business affairs of Aflac Japan are subject to examination by Japans Financial Services Agency (FSA). Aflac Japan files annual reports and financial statements for the Japanese insurance operations based on a March31 fiscal year end, prepared in accordance with Japanese regulatory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the FSA. Japanese regulatory basis earnings are determined using accounting principles that differ materially from U.S. GAAP. Under Japanese regulatory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are charged off immediately; deferred income tax liabilities are recognized on a different basis; policy benefit and claim 6 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements reserving methods and assumptions are different; the carrying value of securities transferred to held-to-maturity is different; policyholder protection corporation obligations are not accrued; premium income is recognized on a cash basis; and different consolidation criteria apply to variable interest entities. Reconciliations of the net assets of the Japan branch on a U.S. GAAP basis to net assets determined on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis as of December31 were as follows: (In millions) 2011 2010 Aflac Japan net assets on GAAP basis $ 10,967 $ 8,852 Elimination of deferred policy acquisition cost asset (7,732 ) (6,964 ) Adjustment to income tax liabilities 4,186 3,602 Adjustment to policy liabilities (5,840 ) (4,265 ) Adjustment of unrealized gains and other adjustments to carrying value of debt securities 2,372 1,886 Elimination of policyholder protection corporation liability 71 108 Reduction in premiums receivable (98 ) (97 ) Difference in consolidation criteria for variable interest entities 21 41 Other, net (1,211 ) (815 ) Aflac Japan net assets on Japanese regulatory accounting basis $ 2,736 $ 2,348 The FSA maintains a solvency standard, which is used by Japanese regulators to monitor the financial strength of insurance companies. The FSA will apply a revised method of calculating the solvency margin ratio for life insurance companies as of fiscal year-end 2011 (March 31, 2012) and has encouraged the disclosure of the ratio as reference information as of fiscal year-end 2010 (March 31, 2011). The FSA has commented that the revision would generally reduce life insurance companies solvency margin ratios to approximately half the level of those reported under the current calculation method. As of December31, 2011, Aflac Japans solvency margin ratio was 985.8% using the current calculation method and, disclosed as reference information, was 547.3% under the new standards. As expected, based on the results of the calculation of the solvency margin ratio under the new standards, Aflac Japans relative position within the industry has not materially changed.
A portion of Aflac Japans annual earnings, as determined on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis, may be repatriated each year to Aflac U.S. These repatriated profits represent a portion of Aflac Japans after-tax earnings reported to the FSA on a March31 fiscal year basis. We may elect not to repatriate profits to Aflac U.S. or to repatriate a reduced amount to strengthen Aflac Japans solvency margin. In addition, the FSA may not allow profit repatriations to Aflac U.S. if the transfers would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of Japanese policyholders. In the near term, we do not expect these requirements to adversely affect the funds available for profit repatriations, nor do we expect these requirements to adversely affect the funds available for payments of allocated expenses to Aflac U.S. and management fees to the Parent Company.
The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. For additional information regarding the policyholder protection fund, see the Policyholder Protection Corporation subsection of MD&A and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.
As a branch of our principal insurance subsidiary, Aflac Japan is also subject to regulation and supervision in the United States (see Regulation  U.S.). For additional information regarding Aflac Japans operations and regulations, see the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of MD&A and Notes 2 and 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.
Regulation  U.S.
The Parent Company and its insurance subsidiaries, Aflac (a Nebraska-domiciled insurance company), American Family Life Assurance Company of New York (Aflac New York, a New York-domiciled insurance company) and CAIC (a South Carolina-domiciled insurance company) are subject to state regulations in the United States as an insurance holding company system. Such regulations generally provide that transactions between companies within the holding company system must be fair and equitable. In addition, transfers of assets among 7 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries, and material transactions between companies within the system, including management fees, loans and advances are subject to prior notice to, or approval by, state regulatory authorities. These laws generally require, among other things, the insurance holding company and each insurance company directly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance departments of their respective domiciliary states and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system.
Like all U.S. insurance companies, Aflac is subject to regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which it does business. In general, the insurance laws of the various jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to, among other things:  granting and revoking licenses to transact business  regulating trade and claims practices  licensing of insurance agents and brokers  approval of policy forms and premium rates  standards of solvency and maintenance of specified policy benefit reserves and minimum loss ratio requirements  capital requirements  limitations on dividends to shareholders  the nature of and limitations on investments  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  filing of financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory insurance accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities  periodic examinations of the market conduct, financial, and other affairs of insurance companies The insurance laws of Nebraska that govern Aflacs activities provide that the acquisition or change of control of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the Nebraska Department of Insurance. A person seeking to acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domestic insurance company or of any person controlling a domestic insurance company (in the case of Aflac, the Parent Company) must generally file with the Nebraska Department of Insurance an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy to Aflac. In Nebraska, control is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, acquires 10% or more of an insurance company or of any other person or entity controlling the insurance company. The 10% presumption is not conclusive and control may be found to exist at less than 10%. Similar laws apply in New York and South Carolina, the domiciliary jurisdictions of the Parent Companys other insurance subsidiaries, Aflac New York and CAIC.
Additionally, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) continually reviews regulatory matters and recommends changes and revisions for adoption by state legislators and insurance departments.
The NAIC uses a risk-based capital formula relating to insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk to facilitate identification by insurance regulators of inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mix of risk inherent in the insurers operations. The formulas for determining the amount of risk-based capital specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a companys regulatory total adjusted capital to its authorized control level risk-based capital as defined by the NAIC. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The levels are company action, regulatory action, authorized control, and mandatory control. Aflacs NAIC risk-based capital ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and surplus position. As of December31, 2011, based on year-end statutory accounting results, Aflacs company action level RBC ratio was 493%.
New federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including health care reform legislation, financial services reform legislation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation, can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. Various forms of federal oversight and regulation of insurance have been passed by Congress and signed into law by the President. For example, the 8 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, federal health care reform legislation, gives the U.S. federal government direct regulatory authority over the business of health insurance. The reform includes major changes to the U.S. health care insurance marketplace.Among other changes, the reform legislation includes an individual medical insurance coverage mandate, provides for penalties on certain employers for failing to provide adequate coverage, creates health insurance exchanges, and addresses coverage and exclusions as well as medical loss ratios. The legislation also includes changes in government reimbursements and tax credits for individuals and employers and alters federal and state regulation of health insurers. These changes will be phased in over the next several years and are directed toward major medical health insurance coverage, which Aflac does not offer. Accordingly, our products are not subject to or covered under the major provisions of the new legislation as enacted.
In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly known as the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, created a Financial Stability and Oversight Council. The Council may designate by a two-thirds vote whether certain insurance companies and insurance holding companies pose a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States, in which case such nonbank financial companies would become subject to prudential regulation by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve, including capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements and examinations. The Board may limit such companys ability to enter into merger transactions, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate one or more activities, or impose conditions on the manner in which it conducts activities. The Dodd-Frank Act also established a Federal Insurance Office under the U.S. Treasury Department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance. The director of the Federal Insurance Office will have the ability to recommend that an insurance company or an insurance holding company be subject to heightened prudential standards. The Dodd-Frank Act requires extensive rule-making and other future regulatory action, which in some cases will take a period of years to implement.

11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ITEM1A.
RISK FACTORS We face a wide range of risks, and our continued success depends on our ability to identify, prioritize and appropriately manage our enterprise risk exposures. Readers should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Form10-K. These risks and other factors may affect forward-looking statements, including those in this document or made by the Company elsewhere, such as in earnings release webcasts, investor conference presentations or press releases. The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, there could be a material impact on the Company.
Difficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy could have a material adverse effect on our investments, capital position, revenue, profitability, and liquidity and harm our business.
Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, in the United States, Japan and elsewhere. Financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia experienced extreme disruption during the latter part of 2008 and much of 2009. Concerns over the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, a declining real estate market in the United States, energy costs and geopolitical issues, among other factors, contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets. These factors, combined with volatile commodity prices, declining business and consumer confidence, increased unemployment, and the impact of the economy on businesses, in particular, precipitated an economic slowdown and fears of a sustained recession.
The volatility and heightened perception of risk that plagued fixed income markets during this period have diminished somewhat, and liquidity is greatly improved in many sectors of the market. However, beginning in early 2010, risk of sovereign defaults or restructurings, combined with decreased valuations and liquidity for certain entities in the European banking sector, have negatively impacted securities issued by these entities. These developments may have an adverse effect on our capital position, in part because we hold in our investment portfolio a significant amount of fixed maturity and perpetual securities, including a large portion issued by banks and financial institutions. Our revenues may decline in such circumstances and our profit margins may erode.
We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, dividends on our common stock, interest on our debt, and liabilities. For a further description of our liquidity needs, including maturing indebtedness, see Item7 of this Form 10-K  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Capital Resources and Liquidity. In the event our current resources do not meet our needs, we may need to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit to the financial services industry and our credit ratings, as well as the possibility that lenders or debt investors may develop a negative perception of us if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn or there are further adverse economic trends in the United States or Japan. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us.
Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, indirectly, the amount and profitability of our business. In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for financial and insurance products could be adversely affected. This adverse effect could be particularly significant for companies such as ours that distribute supplemental, discretionary insurance products primarily through the worksite in the event that economic conditions result in a decrease in the number of new hires and total employees. Adverse changes in the economy could potentially lead our customers to be less inclined to purchase supplemental insurance coverage or to decide to cancel or modify existing insurance coverage, which could adversely affect our premium revenue, results of operations and financial condition. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the United States, Japan and other countries, which may have an adverse effect on us, in part because we are dependent upon customer behavior and spending.
12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The effect that governmental actions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will have on such markets generally, or on us specifically, is difficult to determine at this time.
In response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and concern about financial institutions viability, numerous regulatory and governmental actions have been taken or proposed. As a result, numerous financial institutions have received capital both in the form of emergency loans and direct Treasury equity investments. Within the United States, the Federal Reserve has taken action through reduced federal funds rates and the expansion of acceptable collateral for its loans to provide additional liquidity. In February 2009, the U.S. Congress passed a $787 billion economic stimulus plan. The U.S. Federal Reserve has also engaged in several rounds of quantitative easing in the form of direct purchases of Treasury notes and bonds. The most recent was announced in November 2010 and ended by the third quarter of 2011. In addition to quantitative easing exercises, in the third and fourth quarters of 2011, the U.S. Federal Reserve performed a bond-swap program, called Operation Twist, whereby shorter maturity bonds were sold and longer maturity bonds were purchased in order to lower long-term interest rates.
Within the United Kingdom and Eurozone, similar actions including interest rate cuts and capital injections into financial institutions have been undertaken, including certain institutions that are obligors of the perpetual securities in our investment portfolio. In December 2011, the European Central Bank (ECB) introduced a long term refinancing operation (LTRO). The program provides collateralized three-year low interest loans to financial institutions. This program is anticipated to provide much needed liquidity to Eurozone financial institutions.
Several European governments have passed resolution regime legislation that provides regulators with expanded powers intended to limit the negative impact of large bank failures and protect depositors and taxpayers from further losses. Some of these powers enable the regulator to impose burden sharing upon all providers of capital, including senior unsecured lenders. Burden sharing imposes losses on investments in going-concern issuers as a result of an involuntary change in terms or a reduction in principal or interest. Currently, this legislation is in effect in a few Euro area countries, but it may be adopted across the Euro area in the coming years.
There can be no assurance as to the effect that these governmental actions or other governmental actions taken in the future will have on the financial markets generally or on our competitive position, business and financial condition.
Defaults, downgrades, widening credit spreads or other events impairing the value of the fixed maturity securities and perpetual securities in our investment portfolio may reduce our earnings.
We are subject to the risk that the issuers, guarantors, or counterparties of fixed maturity securities and perpetual securities we own may default on principal, interest and other payments they owe us. We are also subject to the risk that the underlying collateral within loan-backed securities, including collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and mortgage-backed securities, may default on principal and interest payments, causing an adverse change in cash flows from our investment portfolio. The credit rating agencies have been reviewing and modifying their rating criteria for fixed income securities and perpetual securities issued by financial institutions. As a result, many of these securities have been downgraded and may experience further downgrades. The credit rating agencies have also been reviewing and modifying their ratings of sovereigns, particularly the members of the Eurozone.As a result, our holdings of sovereign debt could be downgraded.In addition, the downgrade of a sovereign could also impact the rating and valuation of those corporations domiciled in the sovereign because securities issued by corporations, with even moderate links to their sovereign domiciles, will experience rating downgrades if their sovereign domicile is also downgraded. If burden sharing is imposed for investments in going-concern issuers, we would possibly realize losses as a result of an involuntary change in terms or a reduction in principal or interest. We are not currently required to recognize losses on securities as long as our intent remains not to sell them prior to their anticipated recovery in fair value. If we determine to reposition or realign portions of our investment portfolio so as not to hold certain securities in an unrealized loss position to recovery, we will incur a charge against net income for the unrealized loss in the period that the decision was made not to hold the security to recovery.
In addition to our credit exposure to various obligors and counterparties, we are also exposed to credit spreads, primarily relating to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. A widening of credit spreads will increase the net unrealized loss position of our fixed maturity investment portfolio, and if issuer credit spreads increase significantly or for an extended period of time, it would likely result in higher 13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements other-than-temporary impairment charges. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturity securities. In addition, market volatility has made it difficult to value certain of our securities, such as our perpetual securities and our investments in CDOs and variable interest entities, as trading of such securities has become less frequent. As such, our valuations of such securities may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period-to-period changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Ongoing challenges that may impact valuations include continued weakness in the U.S. real estate market and increased mortgage delinquencies, investor anxiety over the U.S. and global economy, including sovereign issuers, and rating agency downgrades of various structured products and financial issuers.
For more information regarding credit risk, see the Market Risks of Financial Instruments  Credit Risk subsection of MD&A in this report.
The impairment of other financial institutions creditworthiness could adversely affect us.
We have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks and other institutions. Additionally, one of our highest sector concentrations in our investment portfolio is banks and financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of the obligor or the counterparty. In addition, with respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan. Any losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. We have agreements with various financial institutions for the distribution of our insurance products. For example, at December31, 2011, we had agreements with 370 banks to market Aflacs products in Japan. Sales through these banks represented 29% of Aflac Japans new annualized premium sales in 2011. Any material adverse effect on these or other financial institutions could also have an adverse effect on our sales.
We are subject to certain risks as a result of our investments in perpetual securities.
We maintain investments in perpetual securities, which have no stated maturity. As of December31, 2011, we held $6.9 billion of perpetual securities, which represented 6.9% of our total debt and perpetual securities, at amortized cost. Our holdings of perpetual securities are in the following geographic areas: Europe, excluding the United Kingdom (69%); the United Kingdom (9%); Japan (15%); and others (7%).
Perpetual securities have characteristics of both debt and equity investments. The securities have stated interest coupons that were fixed at their time of issuance and subsequently change to a floating, short-term rate of interest of 125 to more than 300 basis points above a pre-determined market index, generally by the 25th year after issuance. While we generally believe that this interest step-up has the effect of creating an economic maturity date of the perpetual securities, no assurances can be given that the issuers of these securities will repay the principal at the time any interest step-up becomes effective.
Perpetual securities typically provide that the issuer is able to defer payment of interest on the securities for up to five years. The Upper Tier II securities that we own have cumulative deferrable payment provisions. However, the Tier I securities that we own do not have similar provisions. No assurance can be given that the issuers of these securities will not defer making interest payments.
There is also a risk that the accounting for these perpetual securities could change in a manner that would have an adverse impact on the reporting for these securities. At the date of filing this Form 10-K, the SEC does not object to the use of a debt impairment model for impairment recognition of these securities as long as there is no significant deterioration in the credit condition of the perpetual securities. The debt impairment model allows the holder to consider whether or not interest and principal payments will be received in accordance with contractual terms and the holders intent and ability to hold the perpetual security until there is a recovery in value. The equity impairment model, by contrast, looks at the length of time a securitys market value has been below its cost basis and the percentage decline to determine whether an impairment should be recorded, without consideration to the holders intent and ability to hold the security until recovery in value. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) currently has a comprehensive project on its agenda to consider changes in the recognition, measurement and impairment of all financial instruments. The outcome and timing of this project is uncertain but could result in 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements changes to the current accounting model for perpetual securities, including the possible recognition of some or all of unrealized losses through earnings rather than equity. Although this change would not affect total shareholders equity as the unrealized loss is already recorded in shareholders equity, it would reduce net income in the period the change occurred and in future periods. Statutory accounting principles account for these securities using the debt model. Additionally, these securities are carried at amortized cost for statutory reporting purposes, with the exception of any securities that are assigned the lowest NAIC rating (i.e. NAIC 6) or are determined to be impaired, i.e. the issuer will not be able to pay interest and principal as contractually due. Should the statutory accounting requirements change regarding the method of recognizing impairments or the values at which the securities should be carried in the financial statements, it could adversely affect our statutory capital, depending upon the changes adopted.
The valuation of our investments and derivatives includes methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
The vast majority of our financial instruments are subject to the fair value classification provisions under GAAP, which specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on observable or unobservable inputs to valuations, and relates to our investment securities classified as available for sale in our investment portfolio, which comprised $54.0 billion (52%)of our total cash and invested assets at December31, 2011. In accordance with GAAP, we have categorized these securities into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1). It gives the next priority to quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities and other inputs that can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities (Level 2). The lowest priority represents unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that reflect the reporting entitys understanding about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (Level 3). An asset or liabilitys classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation.
At December31, 2011, approximately 20%, 72% and 8% of our total available-for-sale securities represented Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 securities, respectively. Securities that are less liquid are more difficult to value and trade. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of the securities in our investment portfolio, if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment. In addition, prices provided by independent pricing services and independent broker quotes can vary widely even for the same security. In such cases, more securities may be transferred to Level 3 from Levels 1 and 2.
As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods which are more sophisticated, thereby resulting in values which may be greater or less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
For further discussion on investment and derivative valuations, see Notes 1, 3, 4, and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.
The determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments is based on significant valuation judgments and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.
The majority of our investments are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment using our debt impairment model. The determination of the amount of impairments under this model is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective securities. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairments in its income statement as such evaluations are revised. There can, 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements however, be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments reflected in our financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments.
An investment in a fixed maturity or a perpetual security is impaired if its fair value falls below its book value. We regularly review our entire investment portfolio for declines in value. Under our debt impairment model, if we believe that a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary, no impairment is taken. However, for our fixed maturity and perpetual securities reported in the available-for-sale portfolio, we report the investments at fair value in the statement of financial condition and record the decline or appreciation as an unrealized loss or gain in accumulated other comprehensive income. Managements assessment of a decline in value includes current judgment as to the financial position and future prospects of the entity that issued the investment security. In the course of our credit review process, we may determine that it is unlikely that we will recover our investment in an issuer due to factors specific to an individual issuer, as opposed to general changes in global credit spreads. In this event, we consider such a decline in the investments fair value, to the extent below the investments cost or amortized cost, to be an other-than-temporary impairment of the investment and write the investment down to its fair value and record a realized loss in our consolidated statements of earnings. The determination of whether an impairment is other than temporary is based on significant judgment and involves the consideration of various factors and circumstances, which includes but is not limited to the following:  issuer financial condition, including profitability and cash flows  credit status of the issuer  the issuers specific and general competitive environment  published reports  general economic environment  future prospects of the issuer  regulatory, legislative and political environment  the severity of the decline in fair value  the length of time the fair value is below cost  our intent or need to dispose of the security prior to recovery of its fair value to amortized cost  other factors as may become available from time to time Our investments in perpetual securities that are rated below investment grade are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment under our equity impairment model. Our equity impairment model focuses on the severity of a securitys decline in fair value coupled with the length of time the fair value of the security has been below amortized cost and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer.
Lack of availability of acceptable yen-denominated investments could adversely affect our profits.
We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. At December31, 2011, the average duration of Aflac Japans policy liabilities was approximately 14 years and the average duration of its yen-denominated debt and perpetual securities was approximately 13 years. The duration of the perpetual securities is based upon their economic maturity dates. Since the securities have no fixed maturity date, there is no assurance that the securities will be repaid on the dates assumed. When the principal of our debt securities or perpetual securities is repaid, there is a risk that the proceeds will be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy liabilities. Our net investment income has been negatively affected by the low level of investment yields in Japan in the last three years.
The concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular single-issuer or sector of the economy may have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
Negative events or developments affecting any particular single issuer, industry, group of related industries or geographic sector may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements concentrated rather than diversified. Therefore, the degree of concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular single issuer, industry, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and, consequently, on our results of operations and financial position. At December31, 2011, approximately 27% of our total portfolio of debt and perpetual securities, on an amortized cost basis, was in the bank and financial institution sector.In addition, at December31, 2011, with the exception of investments in Japanese government bonds (JGBs), we had four single-issuer investments that exceeded the upper bound of our investment risk exposure limits, which is considered to be 10% of total adjusted capital (TAC) on a U.S. statutory accounting basis.
Our concentration of business in Japan poses risks to our operations.
Our operations in Japan, including realized gains and losses on the Japan investment portfolio, accounted for 75% of our total revenues for 2011 and 2010, compared with 73% for 2009. The Japanese operations accounted for 87% of our total assets at December31, 2011, compared with 86% at December31, 2010. The Bank of Japans January 2012 Monthly Report of Recent Economic and Financial Developments stated that Japans economic activity as of the end of 2011 has been more or less flat, due to the effects of a slowdown in overseas economies and the appreciation of the yen. The report projected that Japans economy is expected to gradually return to a moderate recovery path as the pace of recovery in overseas economies improves and reconstruction demand related to the tsunami and earthquake disaster in 2011 gradually materializes. Exports and production are expected to remain more or less flat for the time being and increase moderately thereafter, housing investment and public investment are expected to increase gradually, and private consumption is expected to remain firm. A potential deterioration in Japans economic recovery could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We operate in an industry that is subject to ongoing changes.
We operate in a competitive environment and in an industry that is subject to ongoing changes from market pressures brought about by customer demands, legislative reform, marketing practices and changes to health care and health insurance delivery. These factors require us to anticipate market trends and make changes to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors. We also face the potential of competition from existing or new companies in the United States and Japan that have not historically been active in the supplemental health insurance industry. Failure to anticipate market trends and/or to differentiate our products and services can affect our ability to retain or grow profitable lines of business.
We are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and our net investment income can vary from period to period.
We are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in foreign currency, interest rates, real estate markets, market volatility, the performance of the economy in general, the performance of the specific obligors included in our investment portfolio and other factors outside our control.
Foreign Currency Risk Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported financial position and results of operations. Aflac Japans premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we primarily purchase yen-denominated assets to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen-denominated financial statement items are, however, translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported financial position and results of operations. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. Any unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As a result, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year. In addition, the weakening of the yen relative to the dollar will generally adversely affect the value of our yen-denominated investments in dollar terms. Foreign currency translation also impacts the computation of our risk-based capital ratio because Aflac Japan is consolidated in our U.S. statutory filings due to its status as a branch. Our required capital, as determined by the 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements application of risk factors to our assets and liabilities, is proportionately more sensitive to changes in the exchange rate than our total adjusted capital. As a result, when the yen strengthens relative to the dollar, our risk-based capital ratio is suppressed. We engage in certain foreign currency hedging activities for the purpose of hedging the yen exposure to our net investment in our branch operations in Japan. These hedging activities are limited in scope and we cannot provide assurance that these activities will be effective or that counterparties to these activities will perform their obligations.
Additionally, we are exposed to economic currency risk when yen cash flows are converted into dollars, resulting in an increase or decrease in our earnings when exchange gains or losses are realized. This primarily occurs when we repatriate funds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S., which is generally done on an annual basis. The exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation may differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned.
Interest Rate Risk We have substantial investment portfolios that support our policy liabilities. Low levels of interest rates on investments, such as those experienced in Japan and the United States during recent years, have reduced the level of investment income earned by the Company. Slower investment income growth will occur if a low-interest-rate environment persists. While we generally seek to maintain a diversified portfolio of fixed-income investments that reflects the cash flow and duration characteristics of the liabilities it supports, we may not be able to fully mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities. Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the ability to invest future cash flows to support the interest rate assumption made at the time our products were priced and the related reserving assumptions were established. A rise in interest rates would improve our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds that we reinvest. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would impair our ability to earn the returns assumed in the pricing and the reserving for our products at the time they were sold and issued.
We also have an exposure to interest rates related to the value of the substantial investment portfolios that support our policy liabilities. A rise in interest rates would increase the net unrealized loss position of our debt and perpetual securities. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would decrease the net unrealized loss position of our debt and perpetual securities. While we generally invest our assets to match the duration and cash flow characteristics of our policy liabilities, and therefore would not expect to realize most of these gains or losses, our risk is that unforeseen events or economic conditions, such as changes in interest rates resulting from governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control, reduce the effectiveness of this strategy and either cause us to dispose of some or all of these investments prior to their maturity, or cause the issuers of these securities to default, both of which would result in our having to recognize such gains or losses.
Rising interest rates also negatively impact the solvency margin ratio since unrealized losses on the available-for-sale investment portfolio are included in the calculation. While we closely monitor the solvency margin ratio and have taken steps to reduce the sensitivity of Aflac Japans available-for-sale portfolio to increases in interest rates, there is no assurance that these measures will be fully effective, particularly for sharp increases in interest rates.
Significant, continued volatility, the strengthening or weakening of the yen against the dollar, changes in interest rates, changes in credit spreads and defaults, market liquidity and declines in equity prices, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized positions.
For more information regarding foreign currency and interest rate risk, see the Currency Risk and Interest Rate Risk subsections within the Market Risks of Financial Instruments section of MD&A in this report.
If future policy benefits, claims or expenses exceed those anticipated in establishing premiums and reserves, our financial results would be adversely affected.
We establish and carry, as a liability, reserves based on estimates of how much will be required to pay for future benefits and claims. We calculate these reserves using various assumptions and estimates, including premiums we will receive over the assumed life of the policy; the timing, frequency and severity of the events covered by the insurance policy; and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with a portion of our net cash flow from 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements operations. These assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or claims. If our actual experience is different from our assumptions or estimates, our reserves may prove inadequate. As a result, we would incur a charge to earnings in the period in which we determine such a shortfall exists, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
As a holding company, the Parent Company depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to transfer funds to it to meet its debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock.
The Parent Company is a holding company and has no direct operations or significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. Aflac is domiciled in Nebraska and is subject to insurance regulations that impose certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by Aflac to the Parent Company. The Nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. In addition, the Nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. In addition, the FSA may not allow profit repatriations or other transfers from Aflac Japan if they would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders.
The ability of Aflac to pay dividends or make other payments to the Parent Company could also be constrained by our dependence on financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies. Our ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on Aflacs capitalization level. Any inability of Aflac to pay dividends or make other payments to the Parent Company could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There is no assurance that the earnings from, or other available assets of, our operating subsidiaries will be sufficient to make distributions to us to enable us to operate.
Extensive regulation and changes in legislation can impact profitability and growth.
Aflacs insurance subsidiaries are subject to complex laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, the SEC, the NAIC, the FSA and Ministry of Finance (MOF) in Japan, the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and the U.S. Treasury, including the Internal Revenue Service, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal or regulatory issue may not result in compliance with another regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. There is also a risk that any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal or regulatory issue may change over time to our detriment. In addition, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business.
The primary purpose of insurance company regulatory supervision is the protection of insurance policyholders, rather than investors. The extent of regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes in the United States and by the FSA and the MOF in Japan. These systems of supervision and regulation cover, among other things:  standards of establishing and setting premium rates and the approval thereof  standards of minimum capital requirements and solvency margins, including risk-based capital measures  restrictions on, limitations on and required approval of certain transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates, including management fee arrangements  restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our primary insurance operations 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay or foreign profits that can be repatriated  the existence and licensing status of a company under circumstances where it is not writing new or renewal business  certain required methods of accounting  reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes  assignment of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies  administrative practices requirements  imposition of fines and other sanctions Governmental authorities periodically re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
New federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including health care reform legislation, financial services reform legislation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation, can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. Various forms of federal oversight and regulation of insurance have been passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by the President. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, federal health care reform legislation, gives the U.S. federal government direct regulatory authority over the business of health insurance. The reform includes major changes to the U.S. health care insurance marketplace.Among other changes, the reform legislation includes an individual medical insurance coverage mandate, provides for penalties on certain employers for failing to provide adequate coverage, creates health insurance exchanges, and addresses coverage and exclusions as well as medical loss ratios. The legislation also includes changes in government reimbursements and tax credits for individuals and employers and alters federal and state regulation of health insurers. These changes will be phased in over the next several years andare directed toward major medical health insurance coverage, which Aflac does not offer. Accordingly, our products are not subject to or covered under the major provisions of the new legislation as enacted. However, indirect consequences of the legislation and yet-to-be implemented regulations could potentially have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly known as the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, created a Financial Stability and Oversight Council. The Council may designate by a two-thirds vote whether certain insurance companies and insurance holding companies pose a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States, in which case such nonbank financial companies would become subject to prudential regulation by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve, including capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements and examinations. The Board may limit such companys ability to enter into merger transactions, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate one or more activities, or impose conditions on the manner in which it conducts activities. The Dodd-Frank Act also established a Federal Insurance Office under the U.S. Treasury Department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance. The director of the Federal Insurance Office will have the ability to recommend that an insurance company or an insurance holding company be subject to heightened prudential standards. The Dodd-Frank Act requires extensive rule-making and other future regulatory action, which in some cases will take a period of years to implement.
It is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty whether any other proposed legislation or regulatory changes will be adopted in the United States or Japan or what impact, if any, such new laws, or any future regulation, will have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract, retain and support a network of qualified sales associates.
Our sales could be adversely affected if our sales networks deteriorate or if we do not adequately provide support, training and education for our existing network. Competition exists for sales associates with demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurers and financial institutions primarily on the basis of our products, compensation, support services and financial rating. An inability to attract and retain qualified sales associates could have a material adverse effect on sales and our results of operations and financial condition. Our sales associates are independent contractors and may sell products of our competitors. If our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours, or pay higher commissions than we do, these sales associates may concentrate their efforts on selling our competitors products instead of ours.
Any decrease in our financial strength or debt ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position.
Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on the business of insurance companies. On an ongoing basis, Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs) review the financial performance and condition of insurers and may downgrade or change the outlook on an insurers ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurers statutory capital; a change in a rating agencys determination of the amount of risk-adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating; an increase in the perceived risk of an insurers investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in management; or other considerations that may or may not be under the insurers control.
In addition to financial strength ratings, various NRSROs also publish ratings on our debt. These ratings are indicators of a debt issuers ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner and are important factors in our ability to access liquidity in the debt markets. Downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including adversely limiting our access to capital markets and potentially increasing the cost of debt.
In view of the difficulties experienced in the last several years by many financial institutions, including in the insurance industry, the NRSROs have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, increased the frequency and scope of their reviews, requested additional information from the companies that they rate, including additional information regarding the valuation of investment securities held, and, in certain cases, have increased the capital and other requirements employed in their models for maintenance of certain rating levels.
A downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on agent recruiting and retention, sales, competitiveness and the marketability of our products which could negatively impact our liquidity, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, sales through the bank channel could be adversely affected as a result of their reliance and sensitivity to ratings levels.
We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any NRSRO.
The success of our business depends in part on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology; certain significant multiyear strategic information technology projects are currently in process.
Our business depends in large part on our technology systems for interacting with employers, policyholders and sales associates, and our business strategy involves providing customers with easy-to-use products to meet their needs. Some of our information technology systems and software are older, legacy-type systems that are less efficient and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards (including adequate business continuity procedures). While we are in a continual state of upgrading and enhancing our business systems, changes are always challenging in a complex integrated environment. Our success is dependent in large part on maintaining or improving the effectiveness of existing systems and continuing to develop and enhance information systems that support our business processes in a cost-efficient manner.
21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.
Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in both the United States and Japan, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
The FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) have announced their commitment to achieving a single set of high-quality global accounting standards, and the SEC continues to encourage the convergence of U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in order to narrow the differences between the two sets of standards. In 2010, the SEC announced a Work Plan, the results of which would aid the Commission in its evaluation of the impact that the use of IFRS by U.S. companies would have on the U.S. securities market. Included in this Work Plan is consideration of IFRS, as it exists today and after the completion of various convergence projects currently underway between U.S. and international accounting standards-setters. In October 2010, the SEC issued its first progress report on the Work Plan, summarizing the objectives as well as the efforts and preliminary observations as of that time. In November 2011, the SEC released two staff papers. The papers help to address whether IFRS has developed sufficiently enough to be used in the United States. These papers will aid the SEC in determining whether or not to incorporate IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system. For the insurance industry, key components of the convergence between U. S. GAAP and IFRS have yet to be clarified. The FASB and IASB are currently working on a joint insurance contracts project that will change the way insurance liabilities are determined and reported. The FASB and IASB are also working jointly on revising the guidelines for recognizing impairments of financial instruments. The revisions will cause investment losses to be recognized sooner. These boards are targeting the second half of 2012 to issue exposure documents on both topics. The ultimate outcome and timing of these events is uncertain at this time. The adoption of IFRS and/or the effects of accounting standards convergence could significantly alter the presentation of our financial position and results of operations in our financial statements.
See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for a discussion of recent changes in accounting standards that are pending adoption.
If we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected.
The collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our businesses are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) and in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as such term is defined in the HIPAA regulations).
Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with business associates, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. In addition, despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. The U.S. Congress and many states are considering new privacy and security requirements that would apply to our business. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, requirements, and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, new limitations or constraints on our business models, the development of new administrative processes, and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also may impose further restrictions on our collection, disclosure and use of patient identifiable data that are housed in one or more of our administrative databases. Noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information, whether by us or by one of our vendors, could have a material adverse 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements effect on our business, reputation and results of operations, including: material fines and penalties; compensatory, special, punitive and statutory damages; consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices; adverse actions against our licenses to do business; and injunctive relief.
We face risks related to litigation.
We are a defendant in various lawsuits considered to be in the normal course of business. Members of our senior legal and financial management teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. The final results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. Although some of this litigation is pending in states where large punitive damages, bearing little relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs, have been awarded in recent years, we believe the outcome of pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, costs of settlement or judgments against us or because of changes in our operations that could result from litigation.
Managing key executive succession is critical to our success.
We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for succession of our senior management and other key executives. While we have succession plans and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these cannot guarantee that the services of these executives will be available to us, and our operations could be adversely affected if they are not.
The impact of the earthquake and tsunami natural disaster in March 2011 and related events at the nuclear plant in Japan and their aftermath could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
As of December31, 2011, based on our claims experience and our claims estimates, our initial provision regarding the earthquake and tsunami has proven to be adequate; however, our claims estimates are based on judgments that considered assumptions and projections which are subject to change to reflect future information. Although the impact of the natural disaster and its related events have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations, actual claims may vary from our estimates and may further negatively impact our financial results.
Our business operations in Japan have continued to be fully functional in the aftermath of the natural disaster. However, the recent events in Japan could impair the recovery of the Japanese economy, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We will continue to monitor the business and economic conditions in Japan in light of these events and will continue to update our assessment of the natural disaster impact on our results of operations.
Any event, including one external to our operations, could damage our reputation.
Because insurance products are intangible, we rely to a large extent on consumer trust in our business. The perception of financial weakness could create doubt regarding our ability to honor the commitments we have made to our policyholders. Maintaining our stature as a responsible corporate citizen, which helps support the strength of our unique brand, is critical to our reputation and the failure or perceived failure to do so could adversely affect us.
We also face other risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, which include:  any requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles  failure of our processes to prevent and detect unethical conduct of employees  a significant failure of internal controls over financial reporting  failure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal policies and regulatory requirements  failure of corporate governance policies and procedures 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ITEM1B.

As a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements and notes. This MD&A is divided into the following sections:  Our Business  Performance Highlights  Critical Accounting Estimates  Results of Operations, consolidated and by segment  Analysis of Financial Condition, including discussion of market risks of financial instruments  Capital Resources and Liquidity, including discussion of availability of capital and the sources and uses of cash OUR BUSINESS Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The Companys insurance business is marketed and administered through American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflacs policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Aflac U.S. markets and administers group products through Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC), branded as Aflac Group Insurance. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business.
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS Results for 2011 benefited from the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate. Total revenues rose 6.9% to $22.2 billion, compared with $20.7billion a year ago. Net earnings were $2.0billion, or $4.18 per diluted share, compared with $2.3 billion, or $4.95 per diluted share, in 2010.
Results for 2011 included pretax net realized investment losses of $1.6 billion ($1.0 billion after-tax), compared with net investment losses of $422 million ($274 million after-tax) in 2010. Net investment losses in 2011 consisted of $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after-tax) of other-than-temporary impairment losses; $594 million of net gains ($386 million after-tax) from the sale or redemption of securities; and $245 million of net losses ($159 million after-tax) from valuing derivatives. Shareholders equity at December31, 2011, included a net unrealized gain on investment securities (including derivatives) of $1.2 billion, compared with a net unrealized gain (including derivatives) of $64 million at December31, 2010.
In July 2011, we issued three series of Samurai notes totaling 50 billion yen through a public debt offering. In September 2011, we redeemed 35 billion yen (approximately $459 million using the exchange rate on the date of redemption) of our Uridashi notes upon their maturity. We repurchased 6.0million shares of our common stock in the open market during 2011.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These principles are established primarily by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). In this MD&A, references to GAAP issued by the FASB are derived from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification TM (ASC). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. The estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of Aflacs results of operations and financial condition are those related to the valuation of investments and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs, liabilities for future policy benefits and 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements unpaid policy claims, and income taxes. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from managements analyses and judgments. The application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 96% of our assets and 83% of our liabilities are reported as of December31, 2011, and thus has a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders equity. Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results.
Investments and Derivatives Aflacs investments in debt, perpetual and equity securities include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. For publicly issued securities, we determine the fair values from quoted market prices readily available from public exchange markets and price quotes and valuations from third party pricing vendors. For privately issued securities, we determine the majority of the fair values using a discounted cash flow pricing model and for the remaining securities, non-binding price quotes from outside brokers. We also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary. These reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The identification of distressed investments, the determination of fair value if not publicly traded, and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment and require evaluation of factors, including but not limited to:  issuer financial condition, including profitability and cash flows  credit status of the issuer  the issuers specific and general competitive environment  published reports  general economic environment  regulatory, legislative and political environment  the severity of the decline in fair value  the length of time the fair value is below cost  our intent, need, or both to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery in value  other factors as may become available from time to time Our derivatives are primarily interest rate, foreign currency and credit default swaps that are associated with investments in special-purpose entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) where we are the primary beneficiary. Inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currency forward and spot rates, and interest volatility. Prior to the third quarter of 2011, these interest rate swaps and certain foreign currency swaps were priced by broker quotations. For our credit default swaps and certain foreign currency swaps, there were limited or no observable valuation inputs. We estimated the fair value of these instruments by obtaining broker quotes from a limited number of brokers. These brokers based their quotes on a combination of their knowledge of the current pricing environment and market conditions. In the third quarter of 2011, we changed from receiving valuations from brokers to receiving valuations from a third party pricing vendor for our derivatives.
See Notes 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Policy Liabilities Aflacs products are generally long-duration fixed-benefit indemnity contracts. We make estimates of certain factors that affect the profitability of our business to match expected policy benefits and deferrable acquisition costs with expected policy premiums. These assumptions include persistency, morbidity, mortality, investment yields and expenses. If actual results match the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs, profits will emerge as a level percentage of earned premiums. However, because actual results will vary from the assumptions, profits as a percentage of earned premiums will vary from year to year.
We measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business. Our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are adequate and that our DAC is recoverable.
32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the policys premium payment period in proportion to anticipated premium income. Future amortization of DAC is based upon our estimates of persistency, interest and future premium revenue generally established at the time of policy issuance. However, the unamortized balance of DAC reflects actual persistency. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the New Accounting Pronouncements discussion in this section of MD&A for information on changes to the accounting policy for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts effective January1, 2012.
As presented in the following table, the ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force for Japan decreased in 2011 after having an upward trend for the previous two years. This decrease was due to the lower expense ratio of the first sector products that generated high volumes of sales in Japan. The upward trend in the ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force in Japan in 2010 and 2009 was a result of a greater proportion of our annualized premiums being under the alternative commission schedule, which pays a higher commission on first-year premiums and lower commissions on renewal premiums. This schedule is very popular with our new agents as it helps them with cash flow for personal and business needs as they build their business. While this resulted in a higher unamortized DAC balance, the overall cost to the Company was reduced.
The ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has increased for Aflac U.S. for the last three years. The increase has been primarily driven by a greater proportion of our annualized premiums being under an accelerated commission schedule for new associates and was also impacted by the loss of a large payroll account in 2010 which had a lower ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force.

Policy Liabilities (In millions) 2011 2010 Japan segment: Future policy benefits $ 72,792 $ 66,023 Unpaid policy claims 2,786 2,592 Other policy liabilities 10,944 6,257 Total Japan policy liabilities $ 86,522 $ 74,872 U.S. segment: Future policy benefits $ 6,484 $ 6,078 Unpaid policy claims 1,195 1,126 Other policy liabilities 390 377 Total U.S. policy liabilities $ 8,069 $ 7,581 Consolidated: Future policy benefits $ 79,278 $ 72,103 Unpaid policy claims 3,981 3,719 Other policy liabilities 11,334 6,634 Total consolidated policy liabilities $ 94,593 $ 82,456 Our policy liabilities, which are determined in accordance with applicable guidelines as defined under GAAP and Actuarial Standards of Practice, include two components that involve analysis and judgment: future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, which accounted for 84% and 4% of total policy liabilities as of December31, 2011, respectively.
Future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums. We calculate future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality, persistency and interest. These assumptions are generally established at the time a policy is issued. The assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing the gross premiums for a policy. As required by GAAP, we also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience.
Unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us. We compute unpaid policy claims on a non-discounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments, adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. We update the assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporate our historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our outstanding liability.
Our insurance products provide fixed-benefit amounts per occurrence that are not subject to medical-cost inflation. Furthermore, our business is widely dispersed in both the United States and Japan. This geographic dispersion and the nature of our benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature. Claims incurred under Aflacs policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short time frame. The unpaid claims liability is sensitive to morbidity assumptions, in particular, severity and frequency of claims. Severity is the ultimate size of a claim, and frequency is the number of claims incurred. Our claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of our policyholders.
As a part of our established financial reporting and accounting practices and controls, we perform actuarial reviews of our policyholder liabilities on an ongoing basis and reflect the results of those reviews in our results of operations and financial condition as required by GAAP.
34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our fourth quarter 2011 review indicated that we needed to strengthen the liability associated primarily with a closed block of cancer policies and a block of care policies in Japan, primarily due to low investment yields. We strengthened our future policy benefits liability by $123 million in 2011 as a result of this review. Our fourth quarter 2010 review indicated that we needed to strengthen the liability for a closed block of dementia policies in Japan, primarily due to low investment yields. We strengthened our future policy benefits liability by $93 million in 2010 for this closed block of policies.
In computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, we consider many factors, including the benefits and amounts available under the policy; the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims; and internal business practices, such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices. We monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges. Claim levels are generally stable from period to period; however, fluctuations in claim levels may occur. In calculating the unpaid policy claim liability, we do not calculate a range of estimates. The following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid policy claims liability as of December31, 2011, to changes in severity and frequency of claims. For the years 2009 through 2011, our assumptions changed on average by approximately 1% in total, and we believe that a variation in assumptions in a range of plus or minus 1% in total is reasonably likely to occur.

The growth of the future policy benefits liability in yen for Aflac Japan and in dollars for Aflac U.S. has been due to the aging of our in-force block of business and the addition of new business.
Other policy liabilities, which accounted for 12% of total policy liabilities as of December31, 2011, consisted primarily of discounted advance premiums on deposit from policyholders in conjunction with their purchase of certain Aflac Japan insurance products. See the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of this MD&A for further information.
35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Taxes Income tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing our income tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with GAAP is a two-step process. Under the first step, the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The second step is measurement, whereby a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized.
See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
New Accounting Pronouncements During the last three years, various accounting standard-setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements, interpretations and exposure drafts. We will adopt amended accounting guidance on accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts effective January1, 2012. Under the amended accounting guidance, only incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal contracts may be capitalized, and direct-response advertising costs may be capitalized under certain conditions. The guidance is effective on a prospective or retrospective basis. As of the date of adoption, approximately 70% of our deferred acquisition cost balance was related to compensation paid to third party agents for successful sales and remains deferrable under the amended accounting guidance. The remaining 30% of our deferred acquisition costs balance was evaluated for deferral under the amended accounting guidance. We estimate that the retrospective adoption of this accounting standard effective January1, 2012, will result in an after-tax cumulative reduction to opening retained earnings of $400 million to $500 million, or 3.6% to 4.5% of shareholders equity, as of December31, 2010. We also estimate the adoption will result in an immaterial impact on net income in 2011 and 2012 and for all preceding years.
For additional information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table is a presentation of items impacting net earnings and net earnings per diluted share for the years ended December31.
Items Impacting Net Earnings In Millions Per Diluted Share 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Net earnings $ 1,964 $ 2,344 $ 1,497 $ 4.18 $ 4.95 $ 3.19 Items impacting net earnings, net of tax: Realized investment gains (losses): Securities transactions and impairments (850 ) (273 ) (788 ) (1.81 ) (.58 ) (1.67 ) Impact of derivative and hedging activities (159 ) (1 ) 0 (.34 ) .00 .00 Gain on extinguishment of debt 0 0 11 .00 .00 .02 Other 0 0 (3 ) .00 .00 (.01 ) 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Realized Investment Gains and Losses Our investment strategy is to invest in fixed-income securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the Companys profitability. This investment strategy aligns our assets with our liability structure, which our assets support. We do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses. However, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and/or general portfolio maintenance and rebalancing. The realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products, which are the principal drivers of our profitability.
Securities Transactions and Impairments During 2011, we realized pretax investment losses of $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after-tax) as a result of the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses on certain securities. We realized pretax investment gains, net of losses, of $594 million ($386 million after-tax) from the sale of securities. The impairments and many of the sales were the result of an implemented plan to reduce the risk exposure in our investment portfolio coupled with the continued decline in the credit worthiness of certain issuers. Gains were primarily driven by the sale of U.S. Treasury strips and Japanese Government bonds (JGBs) that were part of a bond-swap program.
In 2010, we realized pretax investment losses of $459 million ($298 million after-tax) as a result of the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses. We realized pretax investment gains, net of losses, of $38 million ($25 million after-tax) from securities sold or redeemed in the normal course of business.
In 2009, we realized pretax investment losses of $1.4 billion ($884 million after-tax) as a result of the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses. We realized pretax investment losses of $101 million ($66 million after-tax) from the exchange of certain perpetual security investments into fixed-maturity securities. The losses were partially offset by pretax investment gains of $250 million ($162 million after-tax) that were generated primarily from a bond-swap program that took advantage of tax loss carryforwards.
See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on these investment activities.
The following table details our pretax impairment losses by investment category for the years ended December31.
(In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Perpetual securities $ 565 $ 160 $ 729 Corporate bonds 1,316 285 458 Collateralized debt obligations 0 0 148 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 17 12 24 Municipalities 2 0 0 Equity securities 1 2 2 Total other-than-temporary impairment losses realized $ 1,901 (1) $ 459 (2) $ 1,361 (2) (1) Includes $1.3 billion for credit-related impairments and $615 million from change in intent to sell securities (2) Consisted completely of credit-related impairments Impact of Derivative and Hedging Activities Effective January1, 2010, we adopted updated accounting guidance which resulted in the consolidation of certain VIEs in which we have an investment. Upon consolidation, the beneficial interest in these VIEs was derecognized and the underlying collateral assets (fixed-maturity securities and perpetual securities) and corresponding foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps were recognized. The change in value of the swaps is recorded through current period earnings, and the change in value of the available-for-sale fixed-maturity and perpetual securities associated with these swaps is recorded through other comprehensive income. We realized pretax investment losses, net of gains, of $245 million ($159 million after-tax) in 2011 and $1 million ($.7 million 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements after-tax) in 2010 from valuing foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps related to our consolidated VIEs. For a description of other items that could be included in the Impact of Derivative and Hedging Activities, see the Hedging Activities subsection of MD&A and Note 4 of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
For additional information regarding realized investment gains and losses, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Debt Extinguishment We did not early extinguish any debt during 2011 or 2010. During 2009, we extinguished portions of our yen-denominated Uridashi and Samurai debt by buying the notes on the open market. We realized a total gain from extinguishment of debt of 1.6 billion yen, or $17 million ($11 million after-tax), which we included in other income.
Foreign Currency Translation Aflac Japans premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we primarily purchase yen-denominated assets to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen-denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. We translate Aflac Japans yen-denominated income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate its yen-denominated balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars.
Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not an economic event to our Company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, management evaluates Aflacs financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.
Income Taxes Our combined U.S. and Japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was 34.4% in 2011, 34.6% in 2010 and 33.0% in 2009. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 primarily reflected the settlement of an examination by the Internal Revenue Service that reduced the tax liability by $24 million. Total income taxes were $1.0 billion in 2011, compared with $1.2 billion in 2010 and $738 million in 2009. Japanese income taxes on Aflac Japans results account for most of our consolidated income tax expense. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Earnings Guidance We communicate earnings guidance in this report based on the growth in net earnings per diluted share. However, certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside of managements control may have a significant impact on actual results. Therefore, our comparison of net earnings includes certain assumptions to reflect the limitations that are inherent in projections of net earnings. In comparing period-over-period results, we exclude the effect of realized investment gains and losses (securities transactions, impairments, and the impact of derivatives and hedging activities) and nonrecurring items. We also assume no impact from foreign currency translation on the Aflac Japan segment and the Parent Companys yen-denominated interest expense for a given year in relation to the prior year.
Subject to the preceding assumptions, our objective for 2011 was to increase net earnings per diluted share by 8% over 2010. We reported 2011 net earnings per diluted share of $4.18. Adjusting that number for after-tax realized investment losses ($2.15 per diluted share) and foreign currency translation (a gain of $.36 per diluted share), we met our objective for the year.
38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our objective for 2012 is to increase net earnings per diluted share by 2% to 5% over 2011, excluding the effect of realized investment gains and losses (securities transactions, impairments, and the impact of derivative and hedging activities), nonrecurring items, and foreign currency translation. This range reflects the impact of portfolio derisking and investing significant cash flows at low interest rates. Once the effects of our investment derisking activities and low interest rate yields on investments have been integrated into our financial results, we expect the rate of earnings growth in 2013 to improve over 2012. If we achieve our objective, the following table shows the likely results for 2012 net earnings per diluted share, including the impact of foreign currency translation using various yen/dollar exchange rate scenarios.
2012 Net Earnings Per Share (EPS) Scenarios (1) Weighted-Average Yen/Dollar Exchange Rate Net Earnings Per Diluted Share % Growth Over 2011 Yen Impact on EPS 70.00 $7.02 - 7.21 10.9 - 13.9% $.56 75.00 6.71 - 6.90 6.0 - 9.0 .25 79.73 (2) 6.46 - 6.65 2.1 - 5.1 .00 80.00 6.45 - 6.64 1.9 - 4.9 (.01) 85.00 6.21 - 6.41 (1.9) - 1.1 (.25) (1) Excludes realized investment gains/losses (securities transactions, impairments, and the impact of derivative and hedging activities) and nonrecurring items in 2012 and 2011 (2) Actual 2011 weighted-average exchange rate INSURANCE OPERATIONS Aflacs insurance business consists of two segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. Aflac Japan, which operates as a branch of Aflac, is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings. GAAP financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual financial statements. Furthermore, we are required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets.
We measure and evaluate our insurance segments financial performance using operating earnings on a pretax basis. We define segment operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses (securities transactions, impairments, and the impact of derivative and hedging activities) and nonrecurring items. We believe that an analysis of segment pretax operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is conducted in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact of translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars.
We evaluate our sales efforts using new annualized premium sales, an industry operating measure. New annualized premium sales, which include both new sales and the incremental increase in premiums due to conversions, represent the premiums that we would collect over a 12-month period, assuming the policies remain in force. For Aflac Japan, new annualized premium sales are determined by applications submitted during the reporting period. For Aflac U.S., new annualized premium sales are determined by applications that are issued during the reporting period. Premium income, or earned premiums, is a financial performance measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period.
39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements AFLAC JAPAN SEGMENT Aflac Japan Pretax Operating Earnings Changes in Aflac Japans pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac Japan for the years ended December31.
Aflac Japan Summary of Operating Results (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Premium income $ 15,619 $ 13,487 $ 12,178 Net investment income: Yen-denominated investment income 1,799 1,645 1,510 Dollar-denominated investment income 889 808 755 Net investment income 2,688 2,453 2,265 Other income (loss) 46 37 43 Total operating revenues 18,353 15,977 14,486 Benefits and claims 11,037 9,553 8,746 Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 686 597 523 Insurance commissions 1,179 1,103 1,060 Insurance and other expenses 1,593 1,441 1,357 Total operating expenses 3,458 3,141 2,940 Total benefits and expenses 14,495 12,694 11,686 Pretax operating earnings (1) $ 3,858 $ 3,283 $ 2,800 Weighted-average yen/dollar exchange rate 79.73 87.69 93.49 In Dollars In Yen Percentage change over previous year: 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Premium income 15.8 % 10.8 % 14.1 % 5.4 % 3.8 % 3.3 % Net investment income 9.6 8.3 10.3 (.4 ) 1.6 (.1 ) Total operating revenues 14.9 10.3 13.7 4.5 3.4 3.0 Pretax operating earnings (1) 17.5 17.3 24.4 6.8 10.0 12.4 (1) See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings.
The percentage increases in premium income in yen reflect the growth of premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of 7.0% in 2011, 4.6% in 2010 and 3.3% in 2009 reflect the high persistency of Aflac Japans business and the sales of new policies. Annualized premiums in force at December31, 2011, were 1.34 trillion yen, compared with 1.26 trillion yen in 2010 and 1.20 trillion yen in 2009. Annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year-end exchange rates, were $17.3 billion in 2011, $15.4 billion in 2010, and $13.0 billion in 2009.
Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar-denominated and reverse-dual currency securities (yen-denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). Dollar-denominated investment income from these assets accounted for approximately 33% of Aflac Japans investment income in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In years when the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar, translating Aflac Japans dollar-denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. In years when the yen weakens, translating dollar-denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. Excluding foreign currency changes from the respective prior year, dollar-denominated investment income accounted for approximately 35% of Aflac Japans investment income during 2011, compared with 34% in 2010 and 36% in 2009.
40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table illustrates the effect of translating Aflac Japans dollar-denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had yen/dollar exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year.

Aflac Japans financial results for 2011 reflected a provision of 3.0 billion yen, or $37 million, for claims related to the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan on March11, 2011. These claims were offset by reserve releases and reinsurance of 2.0 billion yen, or $25 million, resulting in a net income statement impact of 1.0 billion yen, or $12 million, in 2011. The financial results also reflected .7billion yen, or $8million, of operating expenses in the first quarter of 2011 resulting from the earthquake and tsunami. Based on our claims experience to date and our claims estimates, we believe that our initial provision is adequate. The natural disaster and its related events have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In the past several years, the benefit ratio for our health products has been positively impacted by favorable claim trends, primarily in our cancer product line.We expect this downward claim trend to continue.However, for several years, the rate of decline in Aflac Japans benefit ratio has moderated, due primarily to strong sales results in our ordinary products including WAYS and child endowment.These products have higher benefit ratios and lower expense ratios than our third sector products.The benefit ratio has also been impacted by the effect of low investment yields and portfolio derisking, both of which impact our profit margin by reducing the spread between investment yields and required interest on policy reserves (see table and discussion in the Interest Rate Risk subsection of this MD&A). Despite a slight increase in the benefit ratio in 2011, the decrease in the operating expense ratio resulted in an increase in the pretax operating profit margin, compared with 2010. In 2012, we expect to achieve our profit objectives through better-than-average premium growth associated with the life products and somewhat lower profit margins due to the change in business mix discussed above.
41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Aflac Japan Sales In 2011, Aflac Japan generated its largest annual production in its 36-year history. Our upwardly revised objective for 2011 was for sales to be flat to up 5% in yen. New annualized premium sales significantly exceeded our expectations during 2011 and rose to 161.0 billion yen, an 18.6% increase compared with 2010. The following table presents Aflac Japans new annualized premium sales for the years ended December31.
In Dollars In Yen (In millions of dollars and billions of yen) 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 New annualized premium sales $ 2,027 $ 1,554 $ 1,310 161.0 135.8 122.3 Increase (decrease) over prior year 30.5 % 18.6 % 17.5 % 18.6 % 11.0 % 6.7 % The following table details the contributions to new annualized premium sales by major insurance product for the years ended December31.

Bank channel sales generated 29% of new annualized premium sales for Aflac Japan in 2011, compared with 15% in 2010 and 6% in 2009. As the bank channel has become a larger contributor to sales, Aflac Japan has enhanced its product portfolio to better meet the needs of banks. These products include our child endowment product and WAYS, a product that we first introduced in 2006 and introduced to the bank channel in 2009. WAYS has been a primary driver of Aflac Japans sales increase in 2011. The average premium for WAYS sold through the bank channel, the primary distribution outlet for this product, is about ten times the average premium for cancer and medical products, making it a strong contributor to revenue growth. Sales of WAYS were 42.1 billion yen during 2011, an increase of 248.0% over 2010. Our profit margin on WAYS is significantly enhanced when policyholders elect to pay premiums upfront using the discounted advance premium option. Approximately 90% of customers at banks choose this payment option.
Cancer insurance sales increased 5.8% during 2011, compared with 2010. The increase primarily reflected sales of the new base cancer policy, DAYS, which was introduced at the end of March 2011, and DAYS PLUS, which upgrades older cancer policies. The enhancements in this new base policy are a response to the changes in cancer treatment as well as our commitment to being the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan. We are convinced that the affordable cancer products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio.
Medical insurance sales decreased 22.7% during 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to our traditional sales channels being focused on selling our DAYS and DAYS PLUS cancer policies. Despite the comparative sales decrease, we maintained our position as the number one seller of medical insurance policies in Japan. With continued cost pressure on Japans health care system, we expect the need for medical products will continue to rise in the future, and we remain encouraged about the outlook for the medical insurance market.
Sales of our child endowment product increased 8.3% in 2011, compared with 2010, however on a quarterly basis subsequent to the first quarter of 2011, sales of this product have either declined or remained flat compared to the comparable period in 2010. Having sold the child endowment product for more than two years, we have already made a first attempt at selling this product to the eligible target market of families with young children. We expect 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements child endowment sales to decline in 2012 as our distribution channels remain focused on selling WAYS and our new cancer product DAYS.
At December31, 2011, we had agreements to sell our products at 370 banks, or more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. We have seen sales steadily improve at many of these bank branches as training has taken place and as many banks expand their offerings of Aflac products. We believe we have significantly more banks selling our third sector insurance products than any other insurer operating in Japan. We believe our long-standing and strong relationships within the Japanese banking sector, along with our strategic preparations, have proven to be an advantage as this channel opened up for our types of products.
We remain committed to selling through our traditional channels. These channels include affiliated corporate agencies, independent corporate agencies and individual agencies. In 2011, we recruited approximately 5,000 new sales agencies, an increase of 3.8% over 2010. At December31, 2011, Aflac Japan was represented by more than 19,700 sales agencies and more than 120,700 licensed sales associates employed by those agencies.
We believe that there is still a continued need for our products in Japan. We expect that our strong sales results in 2011 will create difficult comparisons in 2012. Following strong sales growth in 2010 and 2011, our objective for 2012 is for new annualized premium sales to be in the range of down 2% to down 5% in Japan.
Aflac Japan Investments Growth of investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations, the timing of investing the cash flow, yields on new investments, and the effect of yen/dollar exchange rates on dollar-denominated investment income. Aflac Japan has invested in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than those available on Japanese government or other public corporate bonds, while still adhering to prudent standards for credit quality. All of our privately issued securities are rated investment grade at the time of purchase. These securities are generally issued with documentation consistent with standard medium-term note programs. In addition, many of these investments have protective covenants appropriate to the specific issuer, industry and country. These covenants often require the issuer to adhere to specific financial ratios and give priority to repayment of our investment under certain circumstances.
The following table presents the results of Aflac Japans investment yields for the years ended December31.
2011 2010 2009 New money yield  yen only 2.39 % 2.39 % 2.80 % New money yield  blended 2.48 2.63 3.03 Return on average invested assets, net of investment expenses 3.18 3.48 3.65 The decrease in the Aflac Japans blended new money yield reflects the low level of interest rates. At December31, 2011, the yield on Aflac Japans investment portfolio, including dollar-denominated investments, was 3.29%, compared with 3.56% a year ago. In order to address our challenge of investing in Japans low-interest-rate environment, in 2011 and 2010, we increased the amount Aflac Japan invested in higher-yielding dollar-denominated securities, including U.S. Treasury strips. We sold these U.S. Treasury strips at the end of 2011, when U.S. Treasury yields decreased, in order to realize investment gains.
43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table presents the composition of total investments by sector, at amortized cost, and cash for Aflac Japan ($91.9 billion in 2011 and $78.4 billion in 2010) as of December31.
Composition of Portfolio by Sector 2011 2010 Debt and perpetual securities, at amortized cost: Banks/financial institutions (1) 26.8 % 34.9 % Government and agencies 32.5 21.6 Municipalities .9 .8 Public utilities 11.8 12.8 Collateralized debt obligations .0 .1 Sovereign and supranational 6.8 7.7 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 1.4 1.9 Other corporate (2) 18.0 18.9 Total debt and perpetual securities 98.2 98.7 Equity securities and other .2 .2 Cash and cash equivalents 1.6 1.1 Total investments and cash 100.0 % 100.0 % (1) Includes 6.9% and 9.3% of perpetual securities at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
(2) Includes .4% of perpetual securities at December31, 2011 and 2010.
Our highest sector concentrations are in government and agencies and banks and financial institution securities. In regards to banks and financial institutions, our investment discipline begins with a top-down approach. We first approve each country we invest in, and within those countries, we primarily invest in financial institutions that are strategically crucial to each countrys economy. The banks and financial institutions sector is a highly regulated industry and plays a strategic role in the global economy. While this is our second largest sector concentration, we achieve some degree of diversification through a geographically diverse universe of credit exposures. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Market Risks of Financial Instruments  Credit Risk subsection of MD&A for more information regarding the sector concentrations of our investments.
Yen-denominated debt and perpetual securities accounted for 91% of Aflac Japans total debt and perpetual securities at December31, 2011 and 2010, at amortized cost.
Funds available for investment include cash flows from operations, investment income, and funds generated from bond swaps, maturities and redemptions. Aflac Japan purchased debt security investments at aggregate acquisition cost of approximately 2,012.0 billion yen in 2011 (approximately $25.5 billion), 790.4 billion yen in 2010 (approximately $9.1 billion), and 955.6 billion yen in 2009 (approximately $10.1 billion). The purchases in 2011 were largely related to a bond-swap program as discussed further below. During the three-year period ended December31, 2011, there were no purchases of perpetual securities, and equity security purchases were immaterial.
44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table presents the composition of debt security purchases for Aflac Japan by sector, as a percentage of acquisition cost, for the years ended December31.
Composition of Purchases by Sector 2011 2010 2009 Debt security purchases, at cost: Banks/financial institutions 3.9 % 8.5 % 4.6 % Government and agencies 83.7 55.1 49.3 Municipalities .7 2.5 3.3 Public utilities 2.4 11.4 14.4 Sovereign and supranational .5 5.8 11.2 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities .0 2.3 1.9 Other corporate 8.8 14.4 15.3 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The change in allocation of purchases from year to year is based on diversification objectives, relative value and availability of investment opportunities. The increase in purchases of securities in the government and agencies sector in 2011 was due to the investment in Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) as part of a bond-swap program and as reinvestment of proceeds from sales of other securities. In addition, we purchased U.S. Treasury strips which were subsequently sold before the end of the year.
We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. Furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and internal credit analysis. The ratings referenced in the two tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P)) or, if not rated, are assigned based on our internal analysis of such securities. For investment grade securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, we use the highest rating that is assigned. For a description of the ratings methodology that we use when a security is split-rated (one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade), see Market Risks of Financial Instruments - Below-Investment-Grade and Split-Rated Securities in the Analysis of Financial Condition section of this MD&A.
The distributions by credit rating of Aflac Japans purchases of debt securities for the years ended December31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows: Composition of Purchases by Credit Rating 2011 2010 2009 AAA 7.0 % .8 % 7.9 % AA 79.5 68.9 62.9 A 7.5 18.5 28.5 BBB 5.4 11.8 .7 BB or lower .6 .0 .0 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Our purchases of securities are determined through an evaluation of attractive relative value that securities present while still meeting our investment policy guidelines for liquidity, safety and quality. The increase in purchases of AAA rated securities during 2011 was due to purchases of U.S. Treasury strips that were subsequently sold prior to the end of the year. The increase in purchases of AA rated securities during 2011 was primarily due to the purchase of JGBs as discussed above. The purchases of BB or lower rated securities during 2011 was due to a limited program that we initiated in May 2011 to invest in senior secured bank loans to U.S. and Canadian corporate borrowers, most of which have below-investment-grade ratings. The program is managed externally by a third party firm specializing in this asset class. Its mandate requires a minimum average credit quality of BB-/Ba3, no loans rated below B/B2, and no exposure to any individual credit greater than 3% of the programs assets. The objectives of this program include enhancing the yield on invested assets, achieving further diversification of credit risk, and mitigating the risk of rising interest rates through the acquisition of floating rate assets.
45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The distributions of debt and perpetual securities owned by Aflac Japan, by credit rating, as of December31 were as follows: Composition of Portfolio by Credit Rating 2011 2010 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value AAA 2.4 % 2.5 % 3.1 % 3.4 % AA 44.3 45.5 38.3 39.4 A 29.3 29.7 34.6 35.2 BBB 18.2 17.2 17.6 17.4 BB or lower 5.8 5.1 6.4 4.6 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The overall credit quality of Aflac Japans investments remained high.

See Notes 3 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Analysis of Financial Condition section of this MD&A for additional information on our investments.
Japanese Economy Japans economy experienced downward pressure in 2011 due to the effects of the earthquake and tsunami that occurred on March11, 2011. However, according to monthly reports published by the Bank of Japan in 2011, the economy showed signs of the improvement in the months following the natural disaster. Production and exports increased at a moderate pace after declining sharply following the earthquake. In addition, both housing investment and private consumption showed signs of improvement. However, The Bank of Japans January 2012 Monthly Report of Recent Economic and Financial Developments stated that, due to effects of the slowdown in overseas economies and the appreciation of the yen, economic activity and production exports have been more or less flat as of the end of 2011. Signs of improvement are still present, as housing investment has generally increased, public investment has stopped declining, and private consumption has remained firm. The report projected that Japans economy is expected to gradually return to a moderate recovery path as the pace of recovery in overseas economies improves and reconstruction demand related to the tsunami and earthquake disaster gradually materializes. Exports and production are expected to remain more or less flat for the time being and increase moderately thereafter, housing investment and public investment are expected to increase gradually, and private consumption is expected to remain firm.
Japanese Regulatory Environment Japans Financial Services Agency (FSA) maintains a solvency standard, which is used by Japanese regulators to monitor the financial strength of insurance companies. The FSA will apply a revised method of calculating the solvency margin ratio for life insurance companies as of fiscal year-end 2011 (March 31, 2012) and has encouraged the disclosure of the ratio as reference information as of fiscal year-end 2010 (March 31, 2011). The FSA had commented that the revision would generally reduce life insurance companies solvency margin ratios to approximately half the level of those reported under the current calculation method. As of December31, 2011, Aflac Japans solvency margin ratio was 985.8% using the current calculation method and, disclosed as reference information, was 547.3% under the new standards. As expected, based on the results of the calculation of the solvency margin ratio under the new standards, Aflac Japans relative position within the industry has not materially changed.
In 2005, legislation aimed at privatizing Japans postal system (Japan Post) was enacted into law. The privatization laws split Japan Post into four entities that began operating in October 2007. In 2007, one of these entities selected Aflac Japan as its provider of cancer insurance to be sold through its post offices, and, in 2008, we began selling cancer insurance through these post offices. Japan Post has historically been a popular place for consumers to purchase insurance products. Currently, our products are being offered in approximately 1,000 post 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements offices. The ruling coalition is currently in discussions with the major opposition parties regarding the direction of postal reform going forward. Regardless, we believe that the Diet debate on postal reform is unlikely to change Aflac Japans relationship with the post office company.

Ratios to total revenues: 2011 2010 2009 Benefits and claims 50.8 % 49.6 % 51.7 % Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 7.8 8.4 8.5 Insurance commissions 10.2 10.4 10.3 Insurance and other expenses 14.0 13.6 13.8 Total operating expenses 32.0 32.4 32.6 Pretax operating earnings (1) 17.2 18.0 15.7 (1) See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings.
In 2010, the pretax operating profit margin and benefit ratio were positively impacted by the loss of a large payroll account, which resulted in the release of the future policy benefit reserves and amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs for policies associated with the account.As expected, our benefit ratio increased in 2011 toward more normal levels, compared with 2010.The expense ratio decreased in 2011; however, the offsetting 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements increase in the benefit ratio resulted in a decline in the pretax operating profit margin, compared with 2010. In 2012, we expect the benefit and expense ratios and pretax operating profit margin to be similar to those experienced in 2011.
Aflac U.S. Sales In 2011, Aflac U.S. generated new annualized premium sales growth of 6.8%, compared with prior year, exceeding our annual sales expectation of flat to 5% sales growth. We believe this sales improvement reflects our intense focus on supporting our field force with enhanced products, including group products, and other resources that help our sales force approach selling in the current economic environment more effectively. The following table presents Aflacs U.S. new annualized premium sales for the years ended December31.
(In millions) 2011 2010 2009 New annualized premium sales $ 1,476 $ 1,382 $ 1,453 Increase (decrease) over prior year 6.8 % (4.9 )% (6.4 )% The following table details the contributions to new annualized premium sales by major insurance product category for the years ended December31.
2011 2010 2009 Income-loss protection: Short-term disability 18 % 17 % 18 % Life 6 6 6 Asset-loss protection: Accident 30 30 30 Critical care (1) 24 23 23 Supplemental medical: Hospital indemnity 16 18 17 Dental/vision 6 6 6 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes cancer, critical illness and hospital intensive care products New annualized premium sales for accident insurance, our leading product category, increased 5%, short-term disability sales increased 13%, critical care insurance sales (including cancer insurance) increased 11%, and hospital indemnity insurance sales decreased 6% in 2011, compared with 2010.
Our sales and marketing areas have synchronized their efforts by creating strategies that continue to benefit our sales results. In 2011, we pursued sales through Smart Launches, which are product-specific coordinated sales marketing efforts geared toward existing accounts. These efforts, which included strategic product pushes of enhanced products including dental and short-term disability, contributed to sales for our veteran agents selling to existing accounts.
As part of our U.S. sales strategy, we continue to focus on growing and enhancing the effectiveness of our U.S. sales force. Field force recruiting continued to benefit from targeted national advertising campaigns that we began in January 2011. These campaigns contributed significantly to our 10.5% increase in recruits during 2011, compared with 2010. We recruited more than 24,400 new sales associates during 2011, resulting in approximately 74,800 licensed sales associates as of December31, 2011.
In addition to expanding the size and capabilities of our traditional sales force, we are encouraged about the opportunities to broaden our distribution by pursuing and strengthening relationships with insurance brokers. Insurance brokers have been a historically underleveraged sales channel for Aflac, so we have been developing relationships with brokers the past several years that complement our traditional distribution system. We have a management team experienced in broker sales, and we are supporting this initiative with streamlined products, targeted broker-specific advertising campaigns, customized enrollment technology, and competitive compensation.
Our group products sold through Aflac Group Insurance have enhanced sales opportunities not only for brokers but also for our traditional sales force of individual associates, especially when they pursue larger payroll accounts.
48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In 2011, sales from Aflac Group Insurance increased 118.1%, compared with the prior year, to $181 million, representing 12% of new annualized premium sales for Aflac U.S.
Although we remain somewhat cautious in our short-term sales outlook for Aflac U.S., our longer-term view has not changed. We believe the need for the products we sell remains strong, and that the United States provides a vast and accessible market for our products. We are taking measures to better reach potential customers through our product and distribution strategy, which includes broadening our product portfolio to include group products in addition to our traditional individually issued products. The addition of the group product platform and our growing broker initiative only serve to enhance our ability to leverage the Aflac brand to reach employees at more companies, large and small, across the United States. Following the passage of health care reform in 2010, we believe employers and consumers will increasingly come to understand the need for the products we offer, just as they have in Japan. For 2012, our objective is for Aflac U.S. new annualized premium sales to increase in the range of 3% to 8%.
Aflac U.S. Investments The following table presents the results of Aflacs U.S. investment yields for the years ended December31.
2011 2010 2009 New money yield 5.75 % 5.82 % 7.26 % Return on average invested assets, net of investment expenses 6.41 6.37 6.66 The decrease in the U.S. new money yield in 2011 reflects a low level of interest rates and tightening credit spreads. At December31, 2011, the portfolio yield on Aflacs U.S. portfolio was 6.72%, compared with 6.92% a year ago. We have investments that support $200 million of variable interest rate funding agreements issued by Aflac U.S. Because these investments do not support our core policyholder benefit obligations, the yield on these investments is not included in the Aflac U.S. portfolio yield or in the yields listed in the above table.
The following table presents the composition of total investments by sector, at amortized cost, and cash for Aflac U.S. ($9.2 billion in 2011 and $9.1billion in 2010) as of December31.

49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Funds available for investment include cash flows from operations, investment income, and funds generated from bond swaps, maturities and redemptions. Aflac U.S. purchased debt security investments at an aggregate acquisition cost of approximately $1.5 billion in 2011, $1.9 billion in 2010 and $1.0 billion in 2009. We purchased no perpetual or equity securities during the three-year period ended December31, 2011. The following table presents the composition of debt security purchases for Aflac U.S. by sector, as a percentage of acquisition cost, for the years ended December31.

We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. Furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and internal credit analysis. The ratings referenced in the two tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by the major credit rating agencies (Fitch, Moodys and S&P) or, if not rated, are assigned based on our internal analysis of such securities. For investment grade securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, we use the highest rating that is assigned. For a description of the ratings methodology that we use when a security is split-rated, see Market Risks of Financial Instruments - Below-Investment-Grade and Split-Rated Securities in the Analysis of Financial Condition section of this MD&A.
The distributions by credit rating of Aflacs U.S. purchases of debt securities for the years ended December31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows: Composition of Purchases by Credit Rating 2011 2010 2009 AAA .1 % 1.6 % 4.9 % AA 12.1 21.5 17.8 A 50.5 53.6 61.4 BBB 37.3 23.3 15.9 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Our purchases of securities are determined through an evaluation of attractive relative value that securities present while still meeting our investment policy guidelines for liquidity, safety and quality.
The distributions of debt and perpetual securities owned by Aflac U.S., by credit rating, as of December31 were as follows: Composition of Portfolio by Credit Rating 2011 2010 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value AAA 1.4 % 1.4 % 5.2 % 5.0 % AA 11.4 11.8 12.6 12.8 A 50.7 52.5 47.4 48.0 BBB 33.1 31.5 30.5 30.1 BB or lower 3.4 2.8 4.3 4.1 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The overall credit quality of Aflac U.S. investments remained high. At the end of 2011, 96.6% of Aflac U.S. debt and perpetual securities were rated investment grade, on an amortized cost basis. See Notes 3 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Analysis of Financial Condition section of this MD&A for additional information on our investments.
U.S. Economy Operating in the U.S. economy continues to be challenging.We generated sales growth that exceeded our expectations for 2011, but even so, ongoing low confidence levels from consumers and small businesses coupled with fewer employees at the worksite continue to pose sales challenges. Our group products and growing relationships with insurance brokers that handle the larger-case market are helping us as we expand our reach to do business with larger businesses. However, most of our business continues to revolve around small business owners and accounts with fewer than 100 employees. Small businesses, in particular, have proven to be especially vulnerable to ongoing economic weakness, and both small-business owners and their workers are anxious about the future.Workers at small businesses are holding back on increasing their spending for voluntary insurance products. Although we believe that the weakened U.S. economy has dampened our sales growth, we also believe our products remain affordable to the average American consumer.We believe that consumers underlying need for our U.S. product line remains strong, and that the United States remains a sizeable and attractive market for our products.
U.S. Regulatory Environment In March 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to give Americans of all ages and income levels access to comprehensive major medical health insurance. The primary subject of the new legislation is major medical insurance; therefore, the PPACA, as enacted, does not directly affect the design of our insurance products or our sales model. Our experience with Japans national health care environment leads us to believe that the need for our products will only increase over the coming years.
In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly known as the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, created a Financial Stability and Oversight Council. The Council may designate by a two-thirds vote whether certain insurance companies and insurance holding companies pose a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States, in which case such nonbank financial companies would become subject to prudential regulation by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Board), including capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements and examinations. The Board may limit such companys ability to enter into merger transactions, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate one or more activities, or impose conditions on the manner in which it conducts activities. The Dodd-Frank Act also established a Federal Insurance Office under the U.S. Treasury Department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance. Traditionally, U.S. insurance companies have been regulated primarily by state insurance departments. The Dodd-Frank Act requires extensive rule-making and other future regulatory action, which in some cases will take a period of years to implement. We believe that Aflac would not likely be considered a company that would pose a systemic risk to the financial stability of the United States. However, at the current time, it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty what impact, if any, the Dodd-Frank Act will have on our U.S. business, financial condition, or results of operations.
OTHER OPERATIONS Corporate operating expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation, benefits, and facilities expenses. Corporate expenses, excluding investment income, were $74 million in 2011, $67 million in 2010 and $77 million in 2009. Investment income included in reported corporate expenses was $10 million in 2011, $11million in 2010 and $9 million in 2009.
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION Our financial condition has remained strong in the functional currencies of our operations. The yen/dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to translate yen-denominated balance sheet items to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.
51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table demonstrates the effect of the change in the yen/dollar exchange rate by comparing select balance sheet items as reported at December31, 2011, with the amounts that would have been reported had the exchange rate remained unchanged from December31, 2010.

Market Risks of Financial Instruments Our investment philosophy is to maximize investment income while emphasizing liquidity, safety and quality. Our investment objective, subject to appropriate risk constraints, is to fund policyholder obligations and other liabilities in a manner that enhances shareholders equity. We seek to achieve this objective through a diversified portfolio of fixed-income investments that reflects the characteristics of the liabilities it supports. Aflac invests primarily within the fixed income securities markets.
The following table details investment securities by segment as of December31.
Investment Securities by Segment Aflac Japan Aflac U.S.

Because we invest in fixed-income securities, our financial instruments are exposed primarily to three types of market risks: currency risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
Currency Risk The functional currency of Aflac Japans insurance operation is the Japanese yen. All of Aflac Japans premiums, claims and commissions are received or paid in yen, as are most of its investment income and other expenses. While we have been investing a portion of our yen cash flow in dollar-denominated securities, most of 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Aflac Japans investments, cash and liabilities are yen-denominated. When yen-denominated securities mature or are sold, the proceeds are generally reinvested in yen-denominated securities. Aflac Japan holds these yen-denominated assets to fund its yen-denominated policy obligations. In addition, Aflac Incorporated has yen-denominated debt obligations.
Although we generally do not convert yen into dollars, we do translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, reported amounts are affected by foreign currency fluctuations. We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of reverse-dual currency securities (yen-denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments), which exposes Aflac to changes in foreign exchange rates. This foreign currency effect is accounted for as a component of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities in accumulated other comprehensive income. When the yen strengthens against the dollar, shareholders equity is negatively impacted and, conversely, when the yen weakens against the dollar, shareholders equity is positively impacted. Aflac Japan invests a portion of its assets in reverse-dual currency securities to provide a higher yield than those available on Japanese government or other public corporate bonds, while still adhering to prudent standards of credit quality. The yen/dollar exchange rate would have to strengthen to approximately 46 before the yield on these instruments would equal that of a comparable yen-denominated instrument.
On a consolidated basis, we attempt to minimize the exposure of shareholders equity to foreign currency translation fluctuations. We accomplish this by investing a portion of Aflac Japans investment portfolio in dollar-denominated securities and by the Parent Companys issuance of yen-denominated debt (for additional information, see the discussion under the Hedging Activities subsection of MD&A). As a result, the effect of currency fluctuations on our net assets is reduced.
53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table demonstrates the effect of foreign currency fluctuations by presenting the dollar values of our yen-denominated assets and liabilities, and our consolidated yen-denominated net asset exposure at selected exchange rates as of December31.

Prior to the adoption of this new accounting guidance, our beneficial interest in certain VIEs was a yen-denominated available-for-sale fixed maturity security.Upon consolidation on January1, 2010, the original yen-denominated investment was derecognized and the underlying U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-maturity or perpetual securities and cross-currency swaps were recognized. While the combination of a U.S. dollar-denominated investment and cross-currency swap economically creates a yen-denominated investment, these investments will create foreign currency fluctuations but have no impact on our net investment hedge position. For additional information, see the Hedging Activities subsection of MD&A.
Some of the consolidated VIEs in our Aflac Japan portfolio use foreign currency swaps to convert foreign denominated cash flows to yen, the functional currency of Aflac Japan, in order to minimize cash flow fluctuations. Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be periodic exchanges of payments at specified intervals based on the agreed upon rates and notional amounts.
54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We are exposed to economic currency risk only when yen funds are actually converted into dollars. This primarily occurs when we repatriate yen-denominated funds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S., which is generally done annually. The exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation will differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. A portion of the repatriation may be used to service Aflac Incorporateds yen-denominated notes payable with the remainder converted into dollars.
Interest Rate Risk Our primary interest rate exposure is to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt and perpetual securities. We use a modified duration analysis modeling approach, which measures price percentage volatility, to estimate the sensitivity of the fair values of our investments to interest rate changes on the debt and perpetual securities we own. For example, if the current duration of a debt security or perpetual security is 10, then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately 10% if market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. Likewise, the fair value of the debt security or perpetual security will decrease by approximately 10% if market interest rates increase by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant.
The estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on the fair values of debt and perpetual securities we own, interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, notes payable, and our obligation to the Japanese policyholder protection corporation as of December31 follows: Sensitivity of Fair Values of Financial Instruments to Interest Rate Changes 2011 2010 (In millions) Fair Value +100 Basis Points Fair Value +100 Basis Points Assets: Debt and perpetual securities: Fixed-maturity securities: Yen-denominated $ 74,474 $ 65,219 $ 62,733 $ 55,518 Dollar-denominated 19,481 17,600 16,091 14,764 Perpetual securities: Yen-denominated 6,129 5,669 7,062 6,444 Dollar-denominated 310 291 450 411 Total debt and perpetual securities $ 100,394 $ 88,779 $ 86,336 $ 77,137 Interest rate and foreign currency swaps $ 375 $ 212 $ 564 $ (251 ) Liabilities: Notes payable (1) $ (3,536 ) $ (3,334 ) $ (3,248 ) $ (3,060 ) Interest rate and foreign currency swaps (401 ) (563 ) (398 ) (8 ) Japanese policyholder protection corporation (71 ) (71 ) (108 ) (108 ) (1) Excludes capitalized lease obligations There are various factors that affect the fair value of our investment in debt and perpetual securities. Included in those factors are changes in the prevailing interest rate environment, which directly affect the balance of unrealized gains or losses for a given period in relation to a prior period. Decreases in market yields generally improve the fair value of debt and perpetual securities, while increases in market yields generally have a negative impact on the fair value of our debt and perpetual securities. However, we do not expect to realize a majority of any unrealized gains or losses because we generally have the intent and ability to hold such securities until a recovery of value, which may be maturity. For additional information on unrealized losses on debt and perpetual securities, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. The following table presents the approximate duration of Aflac Japans yen-denominated assets and liabilities, along with premiums, as of December31.

The decline in Aflac Japans required interest rates on policy reserves from 2010 to 2011 was the result of strengthening of future policy benefit reserves primarily for a closed block of cancer policies and a block of care policies. Over the next two years, we have yen-denominated securities that will mature with yields in excess of Aflac Japans current net investment yield of 3.02%. These securities total $3.9 billion at amortized cost and have an average yield of 4.84%. Currently, when debt and perpetual securities we own mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, adding riders to our older policies has helped offset negative investment spreads on these policies. Overall, adequate profit margins exist in Aflac Japans aggregate block of business because of changes in the mix of business and favorable experience from mortality, morbidity and expenses.
We entered into interest rate swap agreements related to our 5.5 billion yen variable interest rate Samurai notes that we issued in July 2011, and we had interest rate swap agreements related to our 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes that matured in September 2011. These agreements effectively converted the variable interest rate notes to fixed rate notes to eliminate the volatility in our interest expense. We also have interest rate swaps related to some of our consolidated VIEs. These interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts on floating-rate fixed-maturity securities contracts to fixed rates. For further information, see Notes 4 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Credit Risk Our investment activities expose us to credit risk, which is a consequence of extending credit and/or carrying investment positions. However, we continue to adhere to prudent standards for credit quality. We accomplish this by considering our product needs and overall corporate objectives, in addition to credit risk. In evaluating the initial rating, we look at the overall senior issuer rating, the explicit rating for the actual issue or the rating for the security class, and, where applicable, the appropriate designation from the Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). All of our securities have ratings from either a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, the SVO of the NAIC, or are assigned ratings by us based on NAIC rules. In addition, we perform extensive internal credit reviews to ensure that we are consistent in applying rating criteria for all of our securities.
We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. Furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and internal credit analysis. The ratings referenced in the two tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by the major credit rating agencies (Fitch, Moodys and S&P) or, if not rated, are assigned based on our internal analysis of such securities. For investment grade securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, we use the highest rating that is assigned. For a description of the ratings methodology that we use when a security is split-rated, see Market Risks of Financial Instruments - Below-Investment-Grade and Split-Rated Securities in the Analysis of Financial Condition section of this MD&A.
The distributions by credit rating of our purchases of debt securities for the years ended December31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows: Composition of Purchases by Credit Rating 2011 2010 2009 AAA 6.6 % 1.0 % 7.6 % AA 75.8 60.7 58.9 A 9.9 24.5 31.4 BBB 7.2 13.8 2.1 BB or lower .5 0.0 0.0 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Purchases of securities from year to year are determined based on diversification objectives, relative value and availability of investment opportunities, while meeting our investment policy guidelines for liquidity, safety and quality. We did not purchase any perpetual securities during the periods presented in the table above. The increase in purchases of AAA rated securities during 2011 was due to an increase in purchases of U.S. Treasury strips that were subsequently sold prior to the end of the year to generate investment gains. The increase in purchases of AA rated securities during 2011 was primarily due to purchases of JGBs as part of a bond-swap program and for asset liability management purposes. The purchases of BB or lower rated securities during 2011 was due to a limited program that we initiated in May 2011 to invest in senior secured bank loans to U.S. and Canadian corporate borrowers, most of which have below-investment-grade ratings. The program is managed externally by a third party firm specializing in this asset class. Its mandate requires a minimum average credit quality of BB-/Ba3, no loans rated below B/B2, and no exposure to any individual credit greater than 3% of the programs assets. The objectives of this program include enhancing the yield on invested assets, achieving further diversification of credit risk, and mitigating the risk of rising interest rates through the acquisition of floating rate assets.
The distributions of debt and perpetual securities we own, by credit rating, as of December31 were as follows: Composition of Portfolio by Credit Rating 2011 2010 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value AAA 2.3 % 2.3 % 3.3 % 3.6 % AA 41.3 42.0 35.7 36.5 A 31.3 32.1 36.0 36.6 BBB 19.5 18.7 18.8 18.7 BB or lower 5.6 4.9 6.2 4.6 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As of December31, 2011, our direct and indirect exposure to securities in our investment portfolio that were guaranteed by third parties was immaterial both individually and in the aggregate.
Subordination Distribution The majority of our total investments in debt and perpetual securities was senior debt at December31, 2011 and 2010. We also maintained investments in subordinated financial instruments that primarily consisted of Lower Tier II, Upper Tier II, and Tier I securities, listed in order of seniority. The Lower Tier II (LTII) securities are debt instruments with fixed maturities. Our Upper Tier II (UTII) and Tier I investments consisted of debt instruments with fixed maturities and perpetual securities, which have an economic maturity as opposed to a stated maturity.
The following table shows the subordination distribution of our debt and perpetual securities as of December31.

See the Investment Concentrations section below for more information on these derisking activities.
Portfolio Composition For information regarding the amortized cost for our investments in debt and perpetual securities, the cost for equity securities and the fair values of these investments, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Investment Concentrations As of December31, 2011, one of our largest investment industry sector concentrations was banks and financial institutions. Throughout 2008 and during the first half of 2009, concerns related to troubled residential mortgages in 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the United States, United Kingdom and Europe spread to structured investment securities.As a result, banks and financial institutions suffered significant write-downs of asset values, which pressured banks and financial institutions to seek capital and liquidity support.National governments responded with various forms of support, ranging from guarantees on new and existing debt to significant injections of capital.In the second half of 2009, asset valuations generally improved, and banks and other institutions continued to use exchanges and tender offers to enhance their core capital. However, 2010 brought new concerns about the fiscal integrity of peripheral European sovereign nations, and in 2011, concerns about the fiscal integrity of peripheral European sovereigns persisted due to the inability of Eurozone leaders to establish an effective solution. As a result, most financial institutions in the Euro area have faced both liquidity and asset valuation pressures. Greece, Ireland, and, most recently, Portugal were forced to accept external funding aid in various forms to meet their financial obligations, as public markets were not accessible. Nationalization and/or recapitalization, along with loss-sharing among bondholders, all remain distinct risks for financial institutions. While European politicians have become increasingly hesitant to put taxpayers at risk, with few exceptions, we believe nationalizations and burden-sharing among debt holders remain options of last resort.

Included in our largest global investment holdings are positions that date back many years. Additionally, the concentration of certain of our holdings of individual credit exposures has grown over time through merger and consolidation activity. Beginning in 2005, we have generally limited our investment exposures to individual issuers to no more than 5% of total adjusted capital (TAC) on a statutory accounting basis, with the exception of obligations of the Japanese and U.S. governments. However, existing investment exposures that exceeded 5% of TAC at the time this guidance was adopted, or exposures that may exceed this threshold from time to time through merger and consolidation activity, are not automatically reduced through sales of the issuers securities but rather are reduced over time consistent with our investment policy.
In January and February 2012, Mizuho Financial Group Inc. announced the redemption of a total of 20billion yen ($257million using the yen/dollar exchange rate at December31, 2011), on an amortized cost basis, of our perpetual security holdings; 10billion yen will be redeemed on February27, 2012, and 10billion yen will be redeemed on March27, 2012. These securities are being redeemed on their first economic maturity date.
Investments in Certain European Countries With the periphery of Europe garnering the attention of markets, we are disclosing our exposure to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. These countries are at the epicenter of the European debt crisis, and the developments affecting these countries in turn affect the other 12 countries inextricably linked to these five countries through their collective membership in the Economic and Monetary Union and resultant adoption of a single common currency  the euro.
The primary factor considered when determining domicile is the legal domicile of the issuer. However, other factors such as the location of a parent guarantor, the location of the companys headquarters or major business operations (including location of major assets), location of primary market (including location of revenue generation) and specific country risk publicly recognized by rating agencies can influence the assignment of the country (or geographic) risk location. When the issuer is a special financing vehicle or a branch or subsidiary of a global company, then we consider any guarantees and/or legal, regulatory and corporate relationships of the issuer relative to its ultimate parent in determining the proper assignment of country risk.

The banks and financial institutions investments in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain represented 5% and 12% of total investments in the banks and financial institutions sector at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 1% and 4% of total investments in debt and perpetual securities at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Any increases in amortized cost for these peripheral Eurozone investments in 2011 were due to the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar.
63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Greece During the second quarter of 2010, our investments in Greek financial institutions, Alpha Bank, EFG Eurobank Ergasias, and National Bank of Greece (NBG), all of which were Lower Tier II subordinated debt, were downgraded to below investment grade. As a result of the downgrades, we reclassified these investments from held to maturity to available for sale. At that time, we believed the downgrade of the Greek banks was largely related to the problems of the Greek government and its poor fiscal management, rather than the banks specific credit profiles. The three Greek bank issuers that comprised our Greek financial institution holdings had, on average, Tier I capital ratios higher than their peers in other troubled European sovereigns. Their capital was at a level that we felt could sustain deterioration in assets and operations that accompany economic conditions, such as those that the Greek economy was encountering in 2010 and those expected in the next few years. All three Greek banks had sufficient capital under the stress testing applied by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) in July 2010. However, the problems of the Greek government and related ratings downgrades have caused a decline in the confidence of depositors and capital market participants in the Greek banking system. As a result, the banks have significantly relied upon the European Central Bank (ECB) for liquidity via posting of collateral, which tends to be in the form of Greek Government Bonds (GGBs) or debt guaranteed by the sovereign. As of December31, 2010, all of the Greek banks were current on their obligations to us. While these financial institutions had significant investments in GGBs, as of December31, 2010, we believed that these institutions would be solvent even if there were a future restructuring of GGBs and they would have the ability to meet their obligations to us. In addition, as of December31, 2010, we had the intent to hold these investments to recovery in value. As a result, we did not recognize an other-than-temporary impairment for these investments as of December31, 2010.
Subsequent to December31, 2010, Greece remained under pressure, which also continued to weigh on the Greek banks. Skepticism over the rigor of the capital stress test applied by the CEBS in July 2010 grew, as did fears of contagion as Ireland accepted a European Union  International Monetary Fund (EU-IMF) bailout program. On February18, 2011, NBG announced its proposal for a friendly merger with Alpha Bank, but Alpha Bank rejected this proposal. However, this proposal highlighted risks that accompany consolidation among the top three banks in Greece. While the proposal could have created a national champion in Greek banking, it also would have concentrated ownership of GGBs in the combined entity and formed a very low-rated entity among our top ten largest investment holdings. Two rating agencies downgraded the Greek banks subsequent to downgrading the sovereign during the first quarter of 2011 (on January17, 2011, and March9, 2011). In the latter action, the rating agency lowered the ratings indicative of the banks intrinsic financial strength due to the persistent pressure on liquidity, asset quality and material exposure to GGBs. In light of the above increased risks and, in particular, the March9, 2011 downgrade, we no longer supported our previous intent to hold our Greek bank investments to recovery in value. In March 2011, we sold our investment in Alpha Bank and recognized an investment loss of $177 million ($115 million after-tax), and we recognized other-than-temporary impairment losses of $397 million ($258 million after-tax) for the remaining two Greek bank holdings. In the second quarter of 2011, we sold our investment in EFG Eurobank Ergasias for $2 million more than its recorded impaired value, and we sold our remaining Greek bank investment, NBG, for $47 million less than its recorded impaired value. At the end of 2011, we had no direct exposure to Greece.
Ireland During the second quarter of 2011, we sold our holdings in Irish Life and Permanent PLC, which were below-investment-grade perpetual securities that had previously been impaired, at a pretax loss of $74 million ($48 million after-tax). This followed the sale of another of our impaired below-investment-grade Irish financial institution securities in the first quarter of 2011 at a $2 million pretax gain.
As of December31, 2011, our total direct exposure to Ireland was $544 million at amortized cost, comprised of senior unsecured obligations. Senior securities issued by the Bank of Ireland with amortized costs and fair values totaling $257 million and $140 million, respectively, were rated below investment grade. We believe that these unrealized losses were more closely linked to the Irish governments aggressive approach to addressing its debt burden, which included at one point potentially imposing losses on senior debt holders of certain non-viable Irish banks. While the political risk of burden-sharing remains, it significantly subsided during the second half of 2011, as the government has shifted its focus to reducing its debt burden related to the EU/IMF program rather than disrupt the progress made in restoring stability to the Irish banking sector. This Irish bank is current on its obligation to us, and we believe it has the ability to meet its obligations to us. In addition, as of December31, 2011, we had the intent 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements to hold this investment to recovery in value. As a result, we did not recognize an other-than-temporary impairment for this investment as of December31, 2011. The other senior security holdings in Ireland were issued by DEPFA Bank PLC and had an amortized cost of $287 million as of December31, 2011. DEPFA is an Irish-domiciled and licensed financial institution that is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hypo Real Estate Holding, a Germany licensed and regulated financial institution.Due to this ownership by a German parent, DEPFA has not been included in the Republic of Irelands bank re-structuring and capitalization plan.DEPFA has been current on its obligation to us and was rated investment grade at Baa3/BBB/BBB+ by Moodys, S&P and Fitch, respectively, as of December31, 2011.
There have been no additional ratings actions by Moodys since it downgraded Irelands foreign currency long-term debt rating from Baa3 to Ba1 on July12, 2011. Moodys affirmed its rating of Ireland on February13, 2012.S&P placed Irelands foreign currency long-term debt rating of BBB+ on negative watch on December5, 2011 and subsequently removed the watch on January13, 2012. On December16, 2011, Fitch placed its foreign currency long-term debt rating of BBB+ for Ireland on negative watch. Fitch affirmed its rating of Ireland on January27, 2012.
Italy During the second half of 2011, the European sovereign crisis shifted focus from Greece and moved to other periphery European sovereigns, including Italy. We believe the focus on Italy has been driven by a combination of factors which, separately in a normal market environment, would have a limited impact on the fiscal profile and financing capabilities of a developed market government, like Italys. The factors include the EU leaderships inability to solve the Greece fiscal problem, weak economic growth, a high overall debt profile, and a lack of political will to address the governments budget.
As of December31, 2011, our total direct exposure to Italy was $2.6 billion, at amortized cost. This exposure comprised $322 million of direct investment in the sovereign of Italy; a senior unsecured obligation of $193 million; and several utility and industrial companies of $967 million and $1.1 billion, respectively.
We expect the operating environment will be difficult in 2012 as Italys government implements austerity measures to reduce deficits. Meaningful economic growth will be difficult due to the aforementioned austerity measures and a contraction of bank credit. Although there has been substantial improvement in the political environment and the fiscal outlook has improved recently, Italys economic and ratings profile is expected to remain under pressure in the short-term.
Corporates, especially utilities, domiciled in Italy will continue to carry sovereign rating risk, but we expect they will continue to meet obligations due to factors including high barriers to entry, necessity of product/service, good operating cash flow, leading market positions and well-diversified product and market mix.
Italys foreign currency long-term debt rating was downgraded by Moodys from Aa2 to A2 on October4, 2011 and was further downgraded one notch by Moodys to A3 on February13, 2012. S&P placed Italys long-term debt rating of A on negative watch on December5, 2011 and subsequently downgraded the rating to BBB+ on January13, 2012. Italys foreign currency long-term debt rating was downgraded by Fitch from AA- to A+ on October7, 2011. Italys rating was again placed on negative watch by Fitch on December16, 2011, and was subsequently downgraded to A- on January27, 2012.
As of December31, 2011, all of our Italian exposures were rated investment-grade and have been current on their obligations to us and we believe they have the ability to meet their obligations to us.
Portugal As of December31, 2010 and the end of first quarter 2011, the issuers of our Portuguese bank and financial investments, Banco BPI S.A., Caixa Geral de Depositos S.A., and Banco Espirito Santo S.A., were current on their obligations to us, were profitable and had adequate Tier I capital ratios. During the first quarter of 2011, these investments were downgraded to below-investment-grade. However, at that time we believed that these ratings and the unrealized loss position of the investments were the result of the fiscal problems in the Eurozone region rather than the banks specific credit profiles. We believed that Portugals financial institutions were stronger than their other Eurozone peers and had not required much state support. It was challenging to separate the difficulties of the sovereign from the banks since the banks sources of liquidity are limited due to the financial situation of the 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements sovereign. We believed the government of Portugal had exercised more prudent fiscal policies and was in a better financial situation than some of its other Eurozone peers. However, on May16, 2011 when the European Union officially announced a fiscal support package for Portugal, there was an increase in risk that Portugal could experience a stressed economic environment similar to that experienced in Greece and Ireland. We believed the terms of this fiscal support package could result in liquidity constraints on the banks and there could be a need for the banks to improve their liquidity and core capital. Such a situation could negatively impact our Lower Tier II securities and our ability to recover full principal and interest. Due to the reasonably possible risk that our Portuguese bank holdings could suffer further negative declines, we no longer supported our previous intent to hold our Portuguese bank investments to recovery in value and concluded that we would take steps to reduce our exposure in the region. In the second quarter of 2011, we sold our investment in Banco BPI, S.A. at a loss of $99 million ($64 million after-tax), and we recognized other-than-temporary impairment losses of $112 million ($73 million after-tax) and $163 million ($106 million after-tax) on our investments in Caixa Geral de Depositos S.A. and Banco Espirito Santo S.A., respectively. In the third quarter of 2011, we sold our investments in Caixa Geral de Depositos S.A. and Banco Espirito Santo S.A., our remaining Portuguese bank investments, at gains of $52 million ($34 million after-tax) and $54 million ($35 million after-tax), respectively.
As of December31, 2011, our total direct exposure to Portugal was $308 million, at amortized cost. All of this exposure is to electric utility issuers domiciled in Portugal, Redes Energeticas Nacionas SGPS, S.A. (REN) and Energias de Portugal SA (EDP). Our exposure to REN and EDP was $129 million and $179 million, respectively, at amortized cost.
REN, an electric transmission operator, is currently rated Ba1/BBB-. As of December31, 2011, our investment in REN was classified as below investment grade, although S&P maintains an investment grade rating. As of December31, 2011, REN has been current on its obligations to us and we believe it has the ability to meet its obligations to us.
EDP, an integrated electric utility, is currently rated Ba1/BB+/BBB+. As of December 31, 2011, our investment in EDP was classified as investment grade and was current on all its obligations to us. In December 2011, a Chinese utility company, China Three Gorges, announced the acquisition of a majority stake in EDP as part of Portugals sale of strategic asset holdings. EDPs debt rating from Moodys had been Baa3 since July 8, 2011, however following Moodys downgrade of Portugal to Ba3 on February 13, 2012, EDPs debt rating was downgraded to Ba1 on February 16, 2012. S&P placed EDPs foreign issuer credit rating on credit watch negative on December 8, 2011 and subsequently downgraded it from BBB to BB+ on February 1, 2012. Fitch downgraded EDP to BBB+ on April 4, 2011 and affirmed the ratings on December 23, 2011. Due to the downgrade by Moodys on February 16, 2012, we will classify our investment in EDP as below investment grade effective February 2012.
Utilities domiciled in Portugal will continue to carry sovereign rating risk and could experience difficulty in accessing capital markets because of that risk. However, we expect they will continue to meet debt obligations as a result of factors including high barriers to entry, necessity of product/service, good operating cash flow, market leading positions and well-diversified markets.
Spain During 2011, the Euro area sovereign crisis shifted to other periphery European sovereigns, including Spain. The factors influencing the crisis in Spain include the EU leaderships inability to solve the Greece fiscal problem, high unemployment and other social burdens, the rapid decline of its real estate/construction sector, a high fiscal deficit and a difficulty at both the federal and regional level to address the governments fiscal budget.
We expect the operating environment will be difficult in 2012 as Spains government implements austerity measures to reduce deficits at both the federal and regional level. In addition, meaningful economic growth will be difficult due to the aforementioned austerity measures and a contraction of bank credit. Greater uncertainty over their fiscal profiles could make it difficult for most regional governments in Spain to obtain reasonable financing for existing and new debt facilities. Therefore, Spains and its regional governments economic and ratings profile is expected to remain under pressure in the short-term.
As of December31, 2011, our total direct exposure to Spain was $2.6 billion, at amortized cost. This exposure comprised $637 million of investments in sub-sovereign (i.e. regional governments) issuers; senior unsecured 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements obligations of $193 million; several Lower Tier II obligations of $336 million; and Spain-domiciled utilities and industrials of $926 million and $534 million, respectively.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, one of our sub-sovereign investments in Spain, which had an amortized cost and fair value of $123 million and $135 million at December31, 2010, respectively, was downgraded to below investment grade due to a decline in creditworthiness of the issuer. Prior to the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, we exercised our option to put this investment to the issuer at par due to the below-investment grade rating.
Corporates, especially utilities, domiciled in Spain will continue to carry sovereign rating risk, but we expect they will continue to meet obligations due to some or all of the following factors including high barriers to entry, necessity of product/service, good operating cash flow, market leading positions and well-diversified product and market mix.
Spains foreign currency long-term debt rating was downgraded by Moodys from Aa2 to A1 on October18, 2011 and was further downgraded two notches by Moodys to A3 on February13, 2012. S&P placed Spains foreign currency long-term rating of AA- on negative watch on December5, 2011 and subsequently downgraded the rating to A on January13, 2012. Spains foreign currency long-term debt rating of AA- was placed on negative watch on December16, 2011 and was subsequently downgraded to A on January27, 2012.
As of December31, 2011, all of our Spain-domiciled exposures were rated investment grade and were current on their obligations to us, and we believe they have the ability to meet their obligations to us.
Monitoring and mitigating exposure During most of 2011, we saw the Euro area sovereign crisis persist and escalate.As a result, we saw contagion risk expand from periphery Eurozone sovereign credits to also include core Eurozone sovereign credits.Apart from our direct investments in sovereign debt, we view our European financial holdings as our largest indirect exposure due to the high correlation between financials and the sovereign from both a ratings and economics perspective.Our other significant source of indirect exposure is via our investment in fixed income securities issued by integrated electric utilities and industrials domiciled in periphery Eurozone sovereigns.As of December31, 2011, we had investments of $10.1 billion in European financials, $4.3 billion in periphery Eurozone utilities and $7.4 billion in periphery Eurozone industrials, at amortized cost.Our large and diversified exposure requires a considerable allocation of resources.In order to maintain up-to-date knowledge of conditions, we use a number of tools and resources including news reports, rating agency commentary and reports, company reports, third party research, and academic and regulator commentary. In addition, we regularly conduct teleconference and on-site interviews with executives of companies in which we have invested in Europe, rating agency analysts and Euro area regulatory officials to assist us in the monitoring and evaluation of conditions in the Euro area.
Due to the persistency of this crisis and the opportunity to obtain better financial data from the European Banking Authority (EBA) stress tests performed during the year, we performed a more intense and comprehensive stress test on all our financial institutional holdings.Our stress test incorporated the development of several negative events, including the restructuring of European periphery sovereigns and an overall deterioration in various capital ratios.The results of the test assisted us in identifying those credits more likely to experience a serious credit event resulting from a large restructuring event and considering implementing risk mitigation strategies, including, but not limited to, redemption, impairment, sale, or use of credit derivatives. It should be noted that the majority of our holdings are structured as private placements and therefore, other than impairment, there can be no assurance that these risk mitigation strategies would be effective or could be easily executed.
Additionally, in the second half of 2011, we performed a general stress test of our entire investment portfolio based on the recurrence of conditions similar to those experienced in 2008.These conditions incorporated several events, including default of one or more of the Euro area sovereign credits, strengthening of the yen, recession in Japan, Europe and the United States, and a general contraction in available credit.The test contemplated both direct and indirect exposures.The results assisted us in identifying those credits more likely to experience a serious credit event in the coming quarters and possibly implementing risk mitigation strategies, including, but not limited to, redemption, impairment, sale, or use of credit derivatives. It should be noted that the majority of our holdings are structured as private placements and therefore, other than impairment, there can be no assurance that these risk mitigation strategies would be effective or could be easily executed.
67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition, several of our fixed income investments issued by periphery European sub-sovereigns and periphery Eurozone domiciled utilities contain covenants that enable us to seek an early redemption of our security.The covenants contained in these instruments vary from put options that vest should the issuer be downgraded to below investment grade by a rating agency, obligations to maintain leverage below a certain level, obligations to maintain interest coverage ratios above a certain level or a combination of the above.On an amortized cost basis, as of December31, 2011, we had $1.4 billion in securities issued by periphery sub-sovereigns and corporates containing below-investment-grade put options, of which $405 million were issued by sub-sovereign entities and $952 million were issued by corporate and utility companies.As of December31, 2011, we had $862 million in securities issued by periphery corporate and utility companies that contained a leverage covenant, an interest coverage covenant, or a combination of both.
In February 2012, Moodys announced that it will be reviewing several European banks for possible downgrades. The review is expected to be completed within 90 days. While the results of the review are not known at this time, early indications are that as much as $4.8 billion of amortized cost of our holdings are subject to these possible ratings actions.
Derisking During 2011, we pursued strategic investment activities to lower the risk profile of our investment portfolio. Our primary focus was reducing our exposure to peripheral Eurozone banks and financial institutions and sovereign investments and perpetual securities. Our derisking activities in these categories, consisting of sales, redemptions, and impairments, are summarized as follows: Investment Derisking Activities Year Ended December31, 2011 Balance, BeginningofPeriod Realized Investment Gains (Losses) Balance, End of Period (In millions) Par Value Amortized Cost Sales and Redemptions Impairments Par Value Amortized Cost Peripheral Eurozone banks/financial institutions, by country: Ireland (1) $ 1,220 $ 710 $ (72 ) $ 0 $ 544 $ 544 Greece 1,154 1,152 (222 ) (397 ) 0 0 Portugal 859 859 7 (275 ) 0 0 Peripheral Eurozone sovereign investments, by country: Spain 730 730 0 0 637 637 Perpetual securities: Dexia SA (includes Dexia Bank Belgium & Dexia Overseas) $ 552 $ 448 $ 0 $ (273 ) $ 579 $ 190 Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC 58 19 28 0 0 0 Lloyds Banking Group PLC (2) 33 7 18 0 0 0 Swedbank 356 299 2 0 244 185 HSBC Holdings PLC 166 155 4 (21 ) 136 99 BAWAG Capital Finance Jersey 172 120 0 (50 ) 180 77 Hypo Vorarlberg Capital Finance 135 108 0 (31 ) 141 83 KBL European Private Bankers S.A.

As a result of our investment derisking activities, we have experienced significant reductions in peripheral Eurozone, perpetual, and financial exposures on an amortized cost basis. At the start of 2008, sovereign and financial investments in peripheral Eurozone countries comprised 5.9% of total investments and cash, declining to 2.2% by the end of 2011. At the start of 2008, investments in perpetual securities comprised 14.7% of total investments and cash, declining to 6.8% by the end of 2011. At the start of 2008, investments in financial securities comprised 41.9% of total investments and cash, declining to 26.2% by the end of 2011. As a result of these derisking activities, we have no direct sovereign or financial investment exposure to Greece or Portugal, and we have only senior indebtedness in Ireland. As we pursue opportunistic investment transactions, we will continue to take actions to reduce our exposure to European debt.
We also focused on reducing our exposure to large concentrated positions that exceeded 10% of total adjusted capital (TAC) on a statutory accounting basis. During 2011, we reduced our exposure to Israel Electric by $125 million, the Republic of Tunisia by $107 million, HSBC by $108 million, Commerzbank by $283 million, and Bank of America Corp. by $97 million, on an amortized cost basis, through sales and impairments, resulting in a pretax net loss of $240 million ($156 million after-tax). In addition, maturities of certain securities further reduced our exposure to the Republic of Tunisia by $18 million and to Commerzbank by $125 million.
See the Investment Concentrations section of Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our investment derisking activities.
We have investments in both publicly and privately issued securities. The outstanding amount of a particular issuance, as well as the level of activity in a particular issuance and market conditions, including credit events and the interest rate environment, affect liquidity regardless of whether it is publicly or privately issued.
The following table details investment securities by type of issuance as of December31.

Aflac Japan has invested in privately issued securities to better match liability characteristics and secure higher yields than those available on Japanese government or other public corporate bonds. Aflac Japans investments in yen-denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non-Japanese issuers and have longer maturities, thereby allowing us to improve our asset/liability matching and our overall investment returns. Most of our privately issued securities are issued under medium-term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings of the issuer, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and/or event-risk covenants are required.
Below-Investment-Grade and Split-Rated Securities Below-investment-grade debt and perpetual securities represented 5.5% of total debt and perpetual securities at December31, 2011, compared with 6.2% of total debt and perpetual securities at December31, 2010, at amortized cost. Debt and perpetual securities classified as below investment grade at December31, 2011 and 2010 were generally reported as available for sale and carried at fair value.

The program is managed externally by a third party firm specializing in this asset class. Its mandate requires a minimum average credit quality of BB-/Ba3, no loans rated below B/B2, and no exposure to any individual credit greater than 3% of the programs assets. The objectives of this program include enhancing the yield on invested assets, achieving further diversification of credit risk, and mitigating the risk of rising interest rates through the acquisition of floating rate assets. As of December31, 2011, our investments in this program totaled $124 million at amortized cost.
Occasionally, a debt or perpetual security will be split rated. This occurs when one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade. Our policy is to review each issue on a case-by-case basis to determine if a split-rated security should be classified as investment grade or below investment grade, and to assign a credit rating based on such internal analysis. Our review includes evaluating the issuers credit position as well as current market pricing and other factors, such as the issuers or securitys inclusion on a credit rating downgrade watch list. Split-rated securities totaled $2.7 billion as of December31, 2011 and $2.4 billion as of December31, 2010, and represented 3% of total debt and perpetual securities, at amortized cost, at December31, 2011 and 2010.

However, we believe it would be inappropriate to recognize impairment charges because we believe the changes in fair value are temporary. See the Investment Concentrations and Unrealized Investment Gains and Losses sections in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of unrealized losses related to Ireland, financial institutions including perpetual securities, and other corporate investments.
Investment Valuation and Cash We estimate the fair values of our securities available for sale on a monthly basis. We monitor the estimated fair values derived from our discounted cash flow pricing model and those obtained from our custodian, pricing vendors and brokers for consistency from month to month, while considering current market conditions. We also periodically discuss with our custodian and pricing brokers and vendors the pricing techniques they use to monitor the consistency of their approach and periodically assess the appropriateness of the valuation level assigned to the values obtained from them.
Due to our reliance on third-party pricing services to provide valuations on 49% of our Level 2 portfolio, we regularly discuss and review pricing methodologies with the investment custodian. We also review the custodians Service Organization Control (SOC 1) report for the period covering the current year to gain satisfaction with the controls and control environment of the custodian.
See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fair value hierarchy classification of our securities available for sale as of December31, 2011.
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.2 billion, or 2.2% of total investments and cash, as of December31, 2011, compared with $2.1 billion, or 2.4%, at December31, 2010. For a discussion of the factors affecting our cash balance, see the Operating Activities, Investing Activities and Financing Activities sections of this MD&A.

The increase in policy liabilities was primarily the result of growth and aging of our in-force business and the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our policy liabilities.
Notes Payable Notes payable totaled $3.3 billion at December31, 2011, compared with $3.0 billion at December31, 2010. In September 2011, the Parent Company redeemed 35 billion yen (approximately $459 million using the exchange rate on the date of redemption) of Uridashi notes upon their maturity. In July 2011, the Parent Company issued 50 billion yen of yen-denominated Samurai notes (approximately $643 million using the December31, 2011, exchange rate). The ratio of debt to total capitalization (debt plus shareholders equity, excluding the unrealized gains and losses on investment securities and derivatives) was 21.0% as of December31, 2011, compared with 21.7% as of December31, 2010.
In February 2012, the Parent Company issued $750 million of senior notes through a U.S. public debt offering. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our notes payable.
Benefit Plans Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. have various benefit plans. For additional information on our Japanese and U.S. plans, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Policyholder Protection Corporation The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. Legislation enacted regarding the framework of the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC) includes government fiscal measures supporting the LIPPC through March 2012. On December27, 2011, Japans FSA announced plans to enhance the stability of the LIPPC by extending the governments fiscal support of the LIPPC through March 2017. Accordingly, the FSA submitted legislation to the Diet on January27, 2012, to extend the governments fiscal support framework.
Hedging Activities Net Investment Hedge Our primary exposure to be hedged is our investment in Aflac Japan, which is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. To mitigate this exposure, we have taken the following courses of action. First, Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar-denominated securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. The foreign exchange gains and losses related to this portfolio are taxable in Japan and the U.S. when the securities mature or are sold. Until maturity or sale, deferred tax expense or benefit associated with the foreign exchange gains or losses are recognized in other comprehensive income.
Second, we have designated the majority of the Parent Companys yen-denominated liabilities (Samurai and Uridashi notes and yen-denominated loans) as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. At the beginning of each quarter, we make our net investment hedge designation. If the total of our designated yen-denominated liabilities is equal to or less than 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements our net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective and the related exchange effect on the liabilities is reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. Should these designated yen-denominated liabilities exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, the foreign exchange effect on the portion of the liabilities that exceeds our investment in Aflac Japan would be recognized in net earnings. We estimate that if our yen-denominated liabilities exceeded our investment in Aflac Japan by 10 billion yen, we would report a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $1 million for every 1% yen weakening/strengthening in the end-of-period yen/dollar exchange rate. Our net investment hedge was effective during the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. We recognized an immaterial amount in net earnings for the negative foreign exchange effect on the Parent Company yen-denominated liabilities that exceeded our yen net asset position in Aflac Japan in certain quarters of 2011 and 2009.
As mentioned in the Notes Payable section in this MD&A, the Parent Company issued $750 million of senior notes in February 2012. We have entered into cross-currency swaps to convert the dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes into yen-denominated obligations and will designate this debt obligation as part of our net investment hedge.
Effective January1, 2010, the yen net asset figure calculated for hedging purposes differs from the yen-denominated net asset position as discussed in the Currency Risk subsection of MD&A. As disclosed in that subsection, the consolidation of the underlying assets in certain VIEs on January1, 2010, required that we derecognize our yen-denominated investment in the VIE and recognize the underlying U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-maturity or perpetual securities and cross-currency swaps. While these U.S. dollar investments will create foreign currency fluctuations, the combination of the U.S. dollar-denominated investment and the cross-currency swap economically creates a yen-denominated investment that qualifies for inclusion as a component of our investment in Aflac Japan.
The dollar values of our yen-denominated net assets, including certain VIEs as yen-denominated investments for net investment hedging purposes as discussed above, are summarized as follows (translated at end-of-period exchange rates) for the years ended December31: (In millions) 2011 2010 Aflac Japan yen-denominated net assets $ 3,657 $ 3,282 Parent Company yen-denominated net liabilities (1,258 ) (1,041 ) Consolidated yen-denominated net assets (liabilities) subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations $ 2,399 $ 2,241 Cash Flow Hedges Effective January1, 2010, as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance and the corresponding consolidation of additional VIEs, we have freestanding derivative instruments that are reported in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and are reported in other assets and other liabilities. During 2011, we de-designated certain of the derivatives used in cash flow hedging strategies as a result of determining that these swaps would no longer be highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item. The $7 million after-tax gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for these swaps is being amortized into earnings over the expected life of the respective hedged item. The amount amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings related to these swaps was immaterial during 2011. As of December31, 2011, a couple of the freestanding foreign currency swaps that are used within VIEs to hedge the risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates still qualified for hedge accounting. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
We entered into interest rate swap agreements related to our 5.5 billion yen variable interest rate Samurai notes that we issued in July 2011, and we had interest rate swap agreements related to our 20billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes that matured in September 2011. By entering into these contracts, we swapped the variable interest rates to a fixed interest rate of 1.475% for the Samurai notes and 1.52% for the Uridashi notes. We designated these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with the respective variable interest rate notes. These hedges were effective during the three-year period ended December31, 2011. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December31, 2011, we had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on material unconditional purchase obligations that are not recorded on our balance sheet.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the Parent Company through dividends and management fees. The following table presents the amounts provided for the years ended December31: Liquidity Provided by Aflac to Parent Company (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Dividends declared or paid by Aflac $ 282 $ 370 $ 464 Management fees paid by Aflac 230 205 124 The primary uses of cash by the Parent Company are shareholder dividends, the repurchase of its common stock and interest on its outstanding indebtedness. The Parent Companys sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and are not expected to change materially in the future. For additional information, see the Financing Activities subsection of this MD&A.
The Parent Company also accesses debt security markets to provide additional sources of capital. In May 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue an indefinite amount of senior and subordinated debt, in one or more series, from time to time through May 2012. As of December31, 2011, we had issued $2.0 billion of senior notes under this registration statement, and in February 2012, we issued an additional $750 million of senior notes. In November 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement with Japanese regulatory authorities that allowed us to issue up to 100billion yen of yen-denominated Samurai notes in Japan through November 2011. In July 2011, the Parent Company issued 50 billion yen of yen-denominated Samurai notes under this registration statement. In December 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement with Japanese regulatory authorities that allows us to issue up to 100 billion yen of yen-denominated Samurai notes in Japan through January 2014. If issued, these yen-denominated Samurai notes would not be available to U.S.persons. We believe outside sources for additional debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available. For additional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The principal sources of cash for our insurance operations are premiums and investment income. The primary uses of cash by our insurance operations are investments, policy claims, commissions, operating expenses, income taxes and payments to the Parent Company for management fees and dividends. Both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable.
When making an investment decision, our first consideration is based on product needs. Our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the purchase of investment-grade debt securities. These objectives also take into account duration matching, and because of the long-term nature of our business, we have adequate time to react to changing cash flow needs.
As a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. Therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. We expect our future cash flows from premiums and our investment portfolio to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for benefits and expenses.
Our financial statements adequately convey our financing arrangements during the periods presented. We have not engaged in material intra-period short-term financings during the periods presented that are not otherwise reported in our balance sheet. We do not have any restrictive financial covenants related to our notes payable, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable at December31, 2011. We have not entered into transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase financial assets that have 77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements been accounted for as a sale under applicable accounting standards, including securities lending transactions. See Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our securities lending activity. We do not have a known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that would reasonably result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing by a material amount. Our cash and cash equivalents include unrestricted cash on hand, money market instruments, and other debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased, all of which has minimal market, settlement or other risk exposure.
The following table presents the estimated payments by period of our major contractual obligations as of December31, 2011. We translated our yen-denominated obligations using the December31, 2011, exchange rate. Actual future payments as reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate.
Distribution of Payments by Period (In millions) Total Liability (1) Total Payments Less Than OneYear One to ThreeYears Four to FiveYears After FiveYears Future policy benefits liability (Note 7) $ 79,278 $ 342,337 $ 11,022 $ 21,728 $ 21,223 $ 288,364 Unpaid policy claims liability (Note 7) 3,981 3,969 2,983 605 224 157 Long-term debt -principal (Note 8) 3,275 3,281 342 440 799 1,700 Long-term debt -interest (Note 8) 33 2,245 161 313 278 1,493 Policyholder protection corporation (Note 2) 71 71 45 26 0 0 Operating service agreements (Note 14) N/A (2) 631 160 418 53 0 Operating lease obligations (Note 14) N/A (2) 168 62 62 29 15 Capitalized lease obligations (Note 8) 10 10 3 5 1 1 Total contractual obligations $ 86,648 $ 352,712 $ 14,778 $ 23,597 $ 22,607 $ 291,730 Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $21 have been excluded from the tabular disclosure above because the timing of cash payment is not reasonably estimable.
(1) Liability amounts are those reported on the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2011.
(2) Not applicable The distribution of payments for future policy benefits is an estimate of all future benefit payments for policies in force as of December31, 2011. These projected values contain assumptions for future policy persistency, mortality and morbidity. The distribution of payments for unpaid policy claims includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims. Actual amounts and timing of both future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims payments may differ significantly from the estimates above. We anticipate that the future policy benefit liability of $79.3 billion at December31, 2011, along with future net premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund future policy benefit payments.
The distribution of payments due in less than one year for long-term debt consists of 26.6 billion yen for our Samurai notes (approximately $342 million using the December31, 2011, exchange rate) that are due in June 2012. We issued $750 million of senior notes in February 2012 and plan to use the proceeds to redeem these Samurai notes upon their maturity.
For more information on our major contractual obligations, see the applicable Note in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as indicated in the line items in the table above.
Consolidated Cash Flows We translate cash flows for Aflac Japans yen-denominated items into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. In years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported.
78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table summarizes consolidated cash flows by activity for the years ended December31.
(In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Operating activities $ 10,842 $ 6,989 $ 6,161 Investing activities (10,829 ) (7,432 ) (5,476 ) Financing activities 64 161 699 Exchange effect on cash and cash equivalents 51 80 (2 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 128 $ (202 ) $ 1,382 Operating Activities Consolidated cash flow from operations increased 55% in 2011, compared with 2010. The following table summarizes operating cash flows by source for the years ended December31.
(In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Aflac Japan $ 10,246 $ 6,327 $ 5,177 Aflac U.S. and other operations 596 662 984 Total $ 10,842 $ 6,989 $ 6,161 The increase in Aflac Japan operating cash flows during 2011 was largely due to the receipt of discounted advance premiums from policyholders in conjunction with their purchase of certain Aflac Japan insurance products and due to the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar. Aflac U.S. operating cash flows have been reduced by the payout of lump-sum return-of-premium benefits to policyholders on a closed block of U.S. cancer insurance business. These benefit payouts began in 2008 and will significantly decline in 2012 and beyond. We paid out $72 million in 2011, $104 million in 2010, and $152 million in 2009, and we anticipate paying out an additional $25 million over the next year.
Investing Activities Operating cash flow is primarily used to purchase debt securities to meet future policy obligations. The following table summarizes investing cash flows by source for the years ended December31.
(In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Aflac Japan $ (10,246 ) $ (6,221 ) $ (5,156 ) Aflac U.S. and other operations (583 ) (1,211 ) (320 ) Total $ (10,829 ) $ (7,432 ) $ (5,476 ) Prudent portfolio management dictates that we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. Currently, when our debt and perpetual securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, the long-term nature of our business and our strong cash flows provide us with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and/or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. When market opportunities arise, we dispose of selected debt and perpetual securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities, improve future investment yields, and/or rebalance our portfolio. As a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year. Dispositions before maturity were approximately 27% of the annual average investment portfolio of debt and perpetual securities available for sale during the year ended December31, 2011, compared with 7% in 2010 and 12% in 2009. The relatively higher dispositions before maturity in 2011 were due to a bond-swap program that generated investment gains and were also the result of an asset liability management strategy.
79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Financing Activities Consolidated cash provided by financing activities was $64 million in 2011, $161 million in 2010, and $699 million in 2009. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends and treasury stock purchases was $860 million in 2011 and $656 million in 2010, compared with $524 million of dividends in 2009.
In September 2011, we redeemed 35 billion yen of our Uridashi notes upon their maturity. In July 2011, the Parent Company issued 50 billion yen of yen-denominated Samurai notes (approximately $643 million using the December31, 2011, exchange rate). See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this debt issuance.
In August 2010, the Parent Company issued $450 million and $300 million in senior notes that are due in August 2040 and August 2015, respectively. In July 2010, we paid $447 million to redeem 39.4 billion yen of our Samurai notes upon their maturity.
In December 2009, the Parent Company issued $400 million in senior notes that are due in December 2039, and in May 2009, issued $850 million in senior notes that are due in May 2019. In April 2009, we redeemed our $450 million senior notes and settled the related cross-currency, interest rate swaps that were used to convert the original dollar-denominated debt obligation into yen. In August 2009, the Parent Company executed a 5 billion yen loan that is due in August 2015. In July 2009, the Parent Company executed a 10 billion yen loan that is due in July 2015.
During 2009, we extinguished portions of our yen-denominated Uridashi and Samurai debt by buying the notes on the open market. We paid 4.4 billion yen to extinguish 6.0 billion yen of debt, yielding a realized gain from extinguishment of debt of 1.6 billion yen, or $17 million ($11 million after-tax), which we included in other income.
In February 2012, the Parent Company issued $400 million and $350 million of senior notes that are due in February 2017 and February 2022, respectively. We plan to use proceeds from this debt offering to redeem 26.6 billion yen (approximately $342 million using the December 31, 2011, exchange rate) of Samurai notes when they mature in June 2012.
We have no restrictive financial covenants related to our notes payable. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable at December31, 2011.
The following tables present a summary of treasury stock activity during the years ended December31.
Treasury Stock Purchased (In millions of dollars and thousands of shares) 2011 2010 2009 Treasury stock purchases $ 308 $ 121 $ 10 Number of shares purchased: Open market 6,000 2,000 0 Other 182 192 264 Total shares purchased 6,182 2,192 264 Treasury Stock Issued (In millions of dollars and thousands of shares) 2011 2010 2009 Stock issued from treasury: Cash financing $ 26 $ 45 $ 17 Noncash financing 57 2 11 Total stock issued from treasury $ 83 $ 47 $ 28 Number of shares issued 1,852 1,834 1,043 80 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Beginning in February 2009 when the market value of our stock fell below our weighted-average cost of treasury shares, we discontinued issuing shares from treasury and all shares purchased with dividends, as well as those shares used for internal stock award plans, were all purchased on the open market.Beginning again in 2011, these types of stock issuances, considered non-cash, were once again issued using treasury shares.
Under share repurchase authorizations from our board of directors, we purchased 6.0million shares of our common stock in the open market in 2011, compared with 2.0million shares in 2010. During 2009, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. As of December31, 2011, a remaining balance of 24.4million shares of our common stock was available for purchase under a share repurchase authorization by our board of directors in 2008.
Cash dividends paid to shareholders in 2011 of $1.23 per share increased 7.9% over 2010. The 2010 dividend paid of $1.14 per share increased 1.8% over 2009. The following table presents the dividend activity for the years ended December31.
(In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Dividends paid in cash $ 552 $ 535 $ 524 Dividends declared but not paid 0 0 (131 ) Dividends through issuance of treasury shares 23 0 0 Total dividends to shareholders $ 575 $ 535 $ 393 In January 2012, the board of directors declared the first quarter 2012 cash dividend of $.33 per share. The dividend is payable on March1, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February15, 2012.
Regulatory Restrictions Aflac is domiciled in Nebraska and is subject to its regulations. The Nebraska insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by Aflac to the Parent Company. The Nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. In addition, the Nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. These regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by Aflac to the Parent Company. A life insurance companys statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rulesprescribed by the NAIC, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance companys state of domicile. Statutory accounting rulesare different from GAAP and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency.
The continued long-term growth of our business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations. Aflacs insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by the Parent Company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings. The NAICs risk-based capital (RBC) formula is used by insurance regulators to help identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies. The RBC formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurers operations. Aflacs company action level RBC ratio was 493% as of December31, 2011. Aflacs RBC ratio remains high and reflects a strong capital and surplus position. As of December31, 2011, Aflacs total adjusted capital exceeded the amounts to achieve a company action level RBC of 400% and 350% by $1.2billion and $1.9billion, respectively. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the impact of permitted practices by the Nebraska Department of Insurance on our statutory capital and surplus. Currently, the NAIC has an ongoing Solvency Modernization Initiative (SMI) relating to updating the U.S. insurance solvency regulation framework. The SMI will focus on key issues such as capital requirements, governance and risk management, actuarial, and accounting matters.
In addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by U.S. insurance regulators, Japans FSA may not allow profit repatriations from Aflac Japan if the transfers would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders. The FSA maintains its own solvency standard. See the Japanese Regulatory 81 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Environment subsection of this MD&A for a discussion of changes to the calculation of the solvency margin ratio. As of December31, 2011, Aflac Japans solvency margin ratio was 985.8% using the current calculation method, which significantly exceeded regulatory minimums, and was 547.3% under the new standards, disclosed as reference information. As expected, based on the results of the calculation of the solvency margin ratio under the new standards, our relative position within the industry has not materially changed. Given the sensitivity of the solvency margin ratio and the low interest rate environment, we increased our allocation of JGBs classified as held to maturity during the third and fourth quarters of 2011. We continue to evaluate other alternatives for reducing the sensitivity of the solvency margin ratio against interest rate changes.
Payments are made from Aflac Japan to the Parent Company for management fees and to Aflac U.S. for allocated expenses and remittances of earnings. The following table details Aflac Japan remittances for the years ended December31.
Aflac Japan Remittances (In millions of dollars and billions of yen) 2011 2010 2009 Aflac Japan management fees paid to Parent Company $ 28 $ 30 $ 26 Expenses allocated to Aflac Japan 43 37 37 Aflac Japan profit remittances to Aflac U.S. in dollars 143 317 230 Aflac Japan profit remittances to Aflac U.S. in yen 11.0 28.7 20.0 The total amount of profit remittances in 2011 was lower than that in 2010 due to realized investment losses.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under this framework, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011.
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, which is included herein.
83 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Aflac Incorporated: We have audited Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Aflac Incorporateds management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income (loss) for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011, and our report dated February24, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Atlanta, Georgia February24, 2012 84 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Aflac Incorporated: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income (loss) for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of evaluating consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) and qualified special purpose entities (QSPEs) due to the adoption of new accounting requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), effective January1, 2010. Also as discussed in Note 1, the Company changed its method of evaluating other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities due to the adoption of new accounting requirements issued by the FASB, effective January1, 2009.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February24, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

91 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Aflac Incorporated and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The Companys insurance business is marketed and administered through American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflacs policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Additionally, Aflac U.S. markets and administers group products through Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC), branded as Aflac Group Insurance. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business. Aflac Japans revenues, including realized gains and losses on its investment portfolio, accounted for 75% of the Companys total revenues in 2011 and 2010, compared with 73% in 2009. The percentage of the Companys total assets attributable to Aflac Japan was 87% at December31, 2011, and 86% at December31, 2010.
Basis of Presentation We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These principles are established primarily by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). In these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, references to GAAP issued by the FASB are derived from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification TM (ASC). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates when recording transactions resulting from business operations based on currently available information. The most significant items on our balance sheet that involve a greater degree of accounting estimates and actuarial determinations subject to changes in the future are the valuation of investments, deferred policy acquisition costs, liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, and income taxes. These accounting estimates and actuarial determinations are sensitive to market conditions, investment yields, mortality, morbidity, commission and other acquisition expenses, and terminations by policyholders. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates will be revised and reflected in operating results. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, we believe the amounts provided are adequate.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company, its subsidiaries and those entities required to be consolidated under applicable accounting standards. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Significant Accounting Policies Translation of Foreign Currencies : The functional currency of Aflac Japans insurance operations is the Japanese yen. We translate our yen-denominated financial statement accounts into U.S. dollars as follows. Assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period exchange rates. Realized gains and losses on security transactions are translated at the exchange rate on the trade date of each transaction. Other revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated using average exchange rates for the period. The resulting currency translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. We include in earnings the realized currency exchange gains and losses resulting from transactions.
Aflac Japan maintains an investment portfolio of dollar-denominated securities on behalf of Aflac U.S., which serves as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. The functional currency for these investments is the U.S. dollar. The related investment income and realized/unrealized investment gains and losses are also denominated in U.S. dollars. Since the functional currency of this portfolio is the U.S. dollar, there is no translation adjustment to record in other comprehensive income for these investments when the yen/dollar exchange rate changes. However, the foreign exchange gains and losses related to this portfolio are taxable in Japan and the U.S. when the securities mature or are sold. Until maturity or sale, deferred tax expense or benefit associated with the foreign exchange gains or losses is recognized in income tax expense on other comprehensive income.
We have designated a majority of the yen-denominated Uridashi and Samurai notes and yen-denominated loans issued by the Parent Company as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. Outstanding principal and related 92 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements accrued interest on these items are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Currency translation adjustments are recorded through other comprehensive income and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Insurance Revenue and Expense Recognition : The supplemental health and life insurance policies we issue are classified as long-duration contracts. The contract provisions generally cannot be changed or canceled during the contract period; however, we may adjust premiums for supplemental health policies issued in the United States within prescribed guidelines and with the approval of state insurance regulatory authorities.
Insurance premiums for health and life policies are recognized ratably as earned income over the premium payment periods of the policies. When revenues are reported, the related amounts of benefits and expenses are charged against such revenues, so that profits are recognized in proportion to premium revenues during the period the policies are expected to remain in force. This association is accomplished by means of annual additions to the liability for future policy benefits and the deferral and subsequent amortization of policy acquisition costs.
The calculation of deferred policy acquisition costs and the liability for future policy benefits requires the use of estimates based on sound actuarial valuation techniques. For new policy issues, we review our actuarial assumptions and deferrable acquisition costs each year and revise them when necessary to more closely reflect recent experience and studies of actual acquisition costs. For policies in force, we evaluate deferred policy acquisition costs by major product groupings to determine that they are recoverable from future revenues. Any resulting adjustment is charged against net earnings.
Advertising expense is reported as incurred in insurance expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.
Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, money market instruments and other debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased.
Investments : Our debt securities consist of fixed-maturity securities, which are classified as either held to maturity or available for sale. Securities classified as held to maturity are securities that we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity or redemption and are carried at amortized cost. All other fixed-maturity debt securities, our perpetual securities and our equity securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value. If the fair value is higher than the amortized cost for debt and perpetual securities, or the purchase cost for equity securities, the excess is an unrealized gain, and if lower than cost, the difference is an unrealized loss.
The net unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, plus the unamortized unrealized gains and losses on debt securities transferred to the held-to-maturity portfolio, less related deferred income taxes, are recorded through other comprehensive income and included in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Amortized cost of debt and perpetual securities is based on our purchase price adjusted for accrual of discount, or amortization of premium, and recognition of impairment charges, if any. The amortized cost of debt and perpetual securities we purchase at a discount or premium will equal the face or par value at maturity or the call date, if applicable. Interest is reported as income when earned and is adjusted for amortization of any premium or discount.
We have investments in variable interest entities (VIEs). In periods prior to 2010, qualified special purpose entities (QSPEs), a type of VIE, were exempt from consolidation; however, other VIEs were evaluated for consolidation based on the variable interest created by the VIE. Our investments in VIEs and QSPEs were accounted for as fixed-maturity or perpetual securities. The majority of our investments in VIEs and QSPEs were held in our available-for-sale portfolio.
Subsequent to the adoption of updated accounting guidance on VIEs and QSPEs on January1, 2010, our accounting treatment for these investments changed. The concept of QSPEs and their exemption from consolidation was eliminated, therefore, the former QSPEs are now VIEs which are evaluated for consolidation. We adopted the new criteria for evaluating VIEs for consolidation, which, instead of focusing on a quantitative approach, focuses on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (1)the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or (2)the right to receive benefits from the entity. As a result of the application of this new guidance, we are the primary beneficiary of certain VIEs. While the VIEs generally operate within a defined set of documents, there are certain powers that are retained by us that are considered significant in our conclusion that we are the primary beneficiary. These powers 93 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements vary by structure but generally include the initial selection of the underlying collateral or, for collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), the reference credits to include in the structure; the ability to obtain the underlying collateral in the event of default; and the ability to appoint or dismiss key parties in the structure. In particular, our powers surrounding the underlying collateral were the most significant powers since those most significantly impact the economics of the VIE. We have no obligation to provide any continuing financial support to any of the entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. Our maximum loss is limited to our original investment. Neither we nor any of our creditors have the ability to obtain the underlying collateral. Nor do we have control over the instruments in the VIEs, unless there is an event of default. This collateral is reported separately under the captions fixed maturities- and perpetual securities- consolidated variable interest entities on our balance sheet.
For those entities where we are the primary beneficiary, the assets consolidated are fixed-maturity securities, perpetual securities and derivative instruments. The calculation method of the yields on these investments did not change as a result of adoption of the new accounting guidance.
For the collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) held in our fixed-maturity securities portfolio, we recognize income using a constant effective yield, which is based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments. The net investment in CMO securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied at the time of acquisition. This adjustment is reflected in net investment income.
We use the specific identification method to determine the gain or loss from securities transactions and report the realized gain or loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. Securities transactions are accounted for based on values as of the trade date of the transaction.
The majority of our investments are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment using our debt impairment model. Our debt impairment model focuses on the ultimate collection of the cash flows from our investments. Our credit analysts/research personnel routinely monitor and evaluate the difference between the amortized cost and fair value of our investments. Additionally, credit analysis and/or credit rating issues related to specific investments may trigger more intensive monitoring to determine if a decline in fair value is other than temporary. For investments with a fair value below amortized cost, the determination of whether the impairment is other than temporary is subjective and involves the consideration of various factors and circumstances, which includes but is not limited to the following:  issuer financial condition, including profitability and cash flows  credit status of the issuer  the issuers specific and general competitive environment  published reports  general economic environment  future prospects of the issuer  regulatory, legislative and political environment  the severity of the decline in fair value  the length of time the fair value is below cost  other factors as may become available from time to time  our intent or need to dispose of the security prior to recovery of its fair value to amortized cost This process is not exact and requires consideration of risks such as credit risk, which to a certain extent can be controlled, and interest rate risk, which cannot be controlled. Therefore, if an investments amortized cost exceeds its fair value solely due to changes in interest rates, impairment may not be appropriate.
If, after monitoring and analyses, management believes that fair value will not recover to amortized cost prior to the disposal of the security, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment of the security. Once a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the impairment loss is separated into two separate components: the portion of the impairment related to credit and the portion of the impairment related to factors other than credit. We automatically recognize a charge to earnings for the credit-related portion of other-than-temporary impairments.
94 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairments related to factors other than credit are charged to earnings in the event we intend to sell the security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost or if it is more likely than not that we would be required to dispose of the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost; otherwise, non-credit-related other-than-temporary impairments are charged to other comprehensive income.
Our investments in perpetual securities that are rated below investment grade are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment under our equity impairment model. Our equity impairment model focuses on the severity of a securitys decline in fair value coupled with the length of time the fair value of the security has been below amortized cost and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer.
We lend fixed-maturity securities to financial institutions in short-term security lending transactions. These securities continue to be carried as investment assets on our balance sheet during the terms of the loans and are not reported as sales. We receive cash or other securities as collateral for such loans. For loans involving unrestricted cash collateral, the collateral is reported as an asset with a corresponding liability for the return of the collateral. For loans collateralized by securities, the collateral is not reported as an asset or liability.
For further information regarding our investments, see Note 3.
Derivatives and Hedging : We do not use derivatives for trading purposes, nor do we engage in leveraged derivative transactions.
Freestanding derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and are reported in other assets and other liabilities, with changes in value reported in earnings and/or other comprehensive income. These freestanding derivatives are interest rate swaps, credit default swaps (CDSs) and/or foreign currency swaps. Interest rate and foreign currency swaps are used within VIEs to hedge the risk arising from interest rate and currency exchange risk, while the CDSs are used to increase the yield and improve the diversification of the portfolio. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the variability of interest cash flows associated with our variable rate notes.
From time to time, we purchase certain investments that contain an embedded derivative. We assess whether this embedded derivative is clearly and closely related to the asset that serves as its host contract. If we deem that the embedded derivatives terms are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the derivative is separated from that contract, held at fair value and reported with the host instrument in the consolidated balance sheet, with changes in fair value reported in earnings. If we have elected the fair value option, the embedded derivative is not bifurcated, and the entire investment is held at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings.
For those relationships where we seek hedge accounting, we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking derivatives and nonderivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. We also assess, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives and nonderivatives used in hedging activities are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. The assessment of hedge effectiveness determines the accounting treatment of noncash changes in fair value.
Changes in the fair value of any of our derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as long as they are deemed effective. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in current period earnings as a realized investment gain or loss. Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item of the consolidated statements of earnings in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are carried at fair value with all changes in fair value recorded as a realized investment gain or loss. We include the fair value of all freestanding derivatives in either other assets or other liabilities on the balance sheet.
We have designated the majority of our yen-denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes and yen-denominated loans (see Note 8) as nonderivative hedges of the foreign currency exposure to our investment in Aflac Japan. At the beginning of each quarter, we make our net investment hedge designation. If the total of our designated yen-denominated liabilities is equal to or less than our net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective and the related exchange effect is reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other 95 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements comprehensive income. Should these designated yen-denominated liabilities exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, the foreign exchange effect on the portion of the liabilities that exceeds our investment in Aflac Japan would be recognized in net earnings (other income).
For further information regarding derivatives and hedging, see Note 4.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs : The costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized with interest over the premium payment periods in proportion to the ratio of annual premium income to total anticipated premium income. Anticipated premium income is estimated by using the same mortality, persistency and interest assumptions used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits. In this manner, the related acquisition expenses are matched with revenues. Deferred costs include the excess of current-year commissions over ultimate renewal-year commissions and certain incremental direct and allocated policy issue, underwriting and marketing expenses. All of these costs vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business.
For some products, policyholders can elect to modify product benefits, features, rights or coverages by exchanging a contract for a new contract or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. These transactions are known as internal replacements. For internal replacement transactions where the resulting contract is substantially unchanged, the policy is accounted for as a continuation of the replaced contract. Unamortized deferred acquisition costs from the original policy continue to be amortized over the expected life of the new policy, and the costs of replacing the policy are accounted for as policy maintenance costs and expensed as incurred. Internal replacement transactions that result in a policy that is not substantially unchanged are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original policy and the issuance of a new policy. Unamortized deferred acquisition costs on the original policy that was replaced are immediately expensed, and the costs of acquiring the new policy are capitalized and amortized in accordance with our accounting policies for deferred acquisition costs.
See the New Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 1 for a discussion on accounting guidance that will change our accounting policy for deferred acquisition costs effective January1, 2012.
Policy Liabilities : Future policy benefits represent claims that are expected to occur in the future and are computed by a net level premium method using estimated future investment yields, persistency and recognized morbidity and mortality tables modified to reflect our experience, including a provision for adverse deviation. These assumptions are generally established at the time a policy is issued.
Unpaid policy claims are estimates computed on an undiscounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims experience adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. The ultimate liability may vary significantly from such estimates. We regularly adjust these estimates as new claims experience emerges and reflect the changes in operating results in the year such adjustments are made.
For internal replacements that are determined to not be substantially unchanged, policy liabilities related to the original policy that was replaced are immediately released, and policy liabilities are established for the new insurance contract.
Income Taxes : Income tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing our income tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We record deferred tax assets for tax positions taken based on our assessment of whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized.
As discussed in the Translation of Foreign Currencies section above, Aflac Japan maintains a dollar-denominated investment portfolio on behalf of Aflac U.S. While there are no translation effects to record in other comprehensive income, the deferred tax expense or benefit associated with foreign exchange gains or losses on the portfolio is recognized in other comprehensive income until the securities mature or are sold. Total income tax expense (benefit) related to items of other comprehensive income (loss) included a deferred tax benefit of $152 million in 2011, compared with a deferred tax benefit of $322 million in 2010 and a deferred tax expense of $12 million in 2009 for this dollar-denominated portfolio. Excluding these amounts from total taxes on other comprehensive income would result in an effective income tax rate on pretax other comprehensive income (loss) of 34% in 2011, 31% in 2010, and 35% in 2009.
96 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Policyholder Protection Corporation and State Guaranty Association Assessments : In Japan, the government has required the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder protection corporation. We recognize a charge for our estimated share of the industrys obligation once it is determinable. We review the estimated liability for policyholder protection corporation contributions on an annual basis and report any adjustments in Aflac Japans expenses.
In the United States, each state has a guaranty association that supports insolvent insurers operating in those states. To date, our state guaranty association assessments have not been material.
Treasury Stock : Treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of shareholders equity at cost. We use the weighted-average purchase cost to determine the cost of treasury stock that is reissued. We include any gains and losses in additional paid-in capital when treasury stock is reissued.
Share-Based Compensation : We measure compensation cost related to our share-based payment transactions at fair value on the grant date, and we recognize those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award.
Earnings Per Share : We compute basic earnings per share (EPS) by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of unrestricted shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period plus the shares representing the dilutive effect of share-based awards.
New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Fair value measurements and disclosures: In January 2010, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance on fair value disclosures. This guidance requires the activity in fair value hierarchy Level 3 for purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements to be reported on a gross, rather than net, basis. We adopted this guidance as of January1, 2011. The adoption did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Accounting for variable interest entities and transfers of financial assets : In June 2009, the FASB issued amended guidance on accounting for VIEs and transfers of financial assets. This guidance defines new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE; increases the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE; eliminates the exemption for the consolidation of QSPEs; establishes conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale; modifies the financial asset derecognition criteria; and requires additional disclosures. We adopted the provisions of this guidance on January1, 2010 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. We were required to consolidate certain of the VIEs with which we are currently involved. We were not required to deconsolidate any VIEs on January1, 2010.
Upon the initial consolidation of the VIEs on January1, 2010, the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of the VIEs were recorded at their carrying values, which is the amounts at which the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests would have been carried in the consolidated financial statements when we first met the conditions to be the primary beneficiary. For any of the VIEs that were required to be consolidated, we also considered whether any of the derivatives in these structures qualified on January1, 2010, as a cash flow hedge of the changes in cash flows attributable to foreign currency and/or interest rate risk. Certain of the swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting since the swap had a fair value on January1, 2010. Other swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting since they increased, rather than reduced, cash flow risk.
For additional information concerning our investments in VIEs and derivatives, see Notes 3 and 4, respectively.
Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption Presentation of comprehensive income : In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend the presentation of comprehensive income. The amendment requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2011. The amendment also requires reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income to be presented in the statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented; however, in December 2011, the FASB temporarily deferred the effective date of this additional requirement. The adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.
97 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fair value measurements and disclosures: In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. Most of the amendments are clarifications of the FASBs intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. Other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements. The new fair value measurement disclosures include additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures for Level 3 measurements, including a qualitative sensitivity analysis of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs, and categorization by fair value hierarchy level for items for which the fair value is only disclosed. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2011. We expect that the adoption of this guidance will impact our financial statement disclosures, but it will not affect our financial position or results of operations.
A ccounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts : In October 2010, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance on accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. Only incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of a new or renewal contract may be capitalized. The amendment also prohibits capitalizing direct-response advertising costs unless they meet certain criteria. This guidance is effective on a prospective or retrospective basis for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2011. We estimate that the retrospective adoption of this accounting standard effective January1, 2012, will result in an after-tax cumulative reduction to opening retained earnings of $400 to $500 million, or 3.6% to 4.5% of shareholders equity, as of December31, 2010. Furthermore, the adoption of this accounting standard will result in an immaterial impact on net income in 2011 and 2012 and for all preceding years impacted by the retrospective adoption.
Recent accounting guidance not discussed above is not applicable or did not have an impact to our business.
2. BUSINESS SEGMENT AND FOREIGN INFORMATION The Company consists of two reportable insurance business segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S., both of which sell supplemental health and life insurance. Operating business segments that are not individually reportable are included in the Other business segments category.
We do not allocate corporate overhead expenses to business segments. We evaluate and manage our business segments using a financial performance measure called pretax operating earnings. Our definition of operating earnings excludes the following items from net earnings on an after-tax basis: realized investment gains/losses (securities transactions, impairments, and the impact of derivative and hedging activities) and nonrecurring items. We then exclude income taxes related to operations to arrive at pretax operating earnings.

Included in the available-for-sale fixed maturities portfolio as of December31, 2010 were securities with embedded derivatives for which we had elected the fair value option. These securities, recorded at a fair value of $619 million at December31, 2010, were sold during 2011. We recognized investment gains of $12 million for the year ended December31, 2011, compared with investment losses of $1 million and less than $1 million during the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for the changes in fair value of these securities, which excluded the effects of foreign currency translation and additional fair value option elections.
During 2011, we reclassified 13 investments from the held-to maturity portfolio to the available-for-sale portfolio as a result of significant declines in the issuers creditworthiness. At the time of the transfer, the securities had an aggregate amortized cost of $2.5 billion and an aggregate unrealized loss of $334 million.The securities transferred in the first quarter of 2011 included our investments in the Republic of Tunisia that had an aggregate amortized cost of $769 million and four securities associated with financial institutions in Portugal and Ireland with an aggregate amortized cost of $631 million.See the Investment Concentration section below for a discussion of these financial institutions in Portugal and Ireland. The securities transferred in the fourth quarter of 2011 included our investments in Israel Electric that had an aggregate amortized cost of $800 million.
During 2010, we reclassified six investments from the held-to maturity portfolio to the available-for-sale portfolio as a result of significant declines in the issuers creditworthiness. Three of these were investments in Greek financial institutions that, at the time of transfer, had an aggregate amortized cost of $998 million and an aggregate unrealized loss of $599 million. See the Investment Concentration Section below for a discussion of these financial institutions in Greece. Another of the reclassified investments was an investment in Greek sovereign debt that had an amortized cost of $178 million and an unrealized loss of $66 million at the time of transfer. This investment was sold at a pretax realized loss of $59 million prior to the end of the second quarter of 2010. The remaining two securities had an aggregate amortized cost of $267 million and an aggregate unrealized loss of $165 million at the time of the transfer.
During 2009, we reclassified 12 investments from the held-to-maturity portfolio to the available-for-sale portfolio as a result of significant declines in the issuers creditworthiness. At the time of transfer, the securities had an aggregate amortized cost of $1.3 billion and an aggregate unrealized loss of $548 million.

Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
The majority of our perpetual securities are subordinated to other debt obligations of the issuer, but rank higher than the issuers equity securities. Perpetual securities have characteristics of both debt and equity investments, along with unique features that create economic maturity dates for the securities. Although perpetual securities have no contractual maturity date, they have stated interest coupons that were fixed at their issuance and subsequently change to a floating short-term interest rate of 125 to more than 300 basis points above an appropriate market index, generally by the 25 th year after issuance, thereby creating an economic maturity date. The economic maturities of our investments in perpetual securities, which were all reported as available for sale at December31, 2011, were as follows: Aflac Japan Aflac U.S.

Consistent with that approach, we first approve each country in which we invest. In our approach to sovereign analysis, we consider the political, legal and financial context of the sovereign entity in which an issuer is domiciled and operates. Next we approve the issuers industry sector, including such factors as the stability of results and the importance of the sector to the overall economy. Specific credit names within approved countries and industry 104 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements sectors are evaluated for their market position and specific strengths and potential weaknesses. Structures in which we invest are chosen for specific portfolio management purposes, including asset/liability management, portfolio diversification and net investment income.

Within the countries we approve for investment opportunities, we primarily invest in financial institutions that are strategically crucial to each approved countrys economy. The bank and financial institution sector is a highly regulated industry and plays a strategic role in the global economy. We achieve some degree of diversification in the bank and financial institution sector through a geographically diverse universe of credit exposures. Within this sector, the more significant concentration of our credit risk by geographic region or country of issuer at December31, 2011, based on amortized cost, was: Europe, excluding the United Kingdom (38%); United States (22%); United Kingdom (8%); Japan (9%); and other (23%).

Our primary focus was on reducing our exposure to peripheral Eurozone investments, certain perpetual securities, and investments in certain banks or financial institutions.

The sales losses were more than offset by the investment gains generated from the sale of U.S. Treasury strips and Japanese Government bonds (JGBs) that were part of a bond-swap program.
In 2010, we recognized other-than-temporary impairment losses and realized net investment gains from the sale and redemption of securities in the normal course of business.
In 2009, we recognized other-than-temporary impairment losses and realized pretax investment losses from the exchange of certain perpetual security investments into fixed-maturity securities. The losses were partially offset by pretax investment gains that were generated primarily from a bond-swap program that took advantage of tax loss carryforwards.
106 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Other-than-temporary Impairment The fair value of our debt and perpetual security investments fluctuates based on changes in credit spreads in the global financial markets. Credit spreads are most impacted by market rates of interest, the general and specific credit environment and global market liquidity. We believe that fluctuations in the fair value of our investment securities related to changes in credit spreads have little bearing on whether our investment is ultimately recoverable. Generally, we consider such declines in fair value to be temporary even in situations where an investment remains in an unrealized loss position for a year or more.
However, in the course of our credit review process, we may determine that it is unlikely that we will recover our investment in an issuer due to factors specific to an individual issuer, as opposed to general changes in global credit spreads. In this event, we consider such a decline in the investments fair value, to the extent below the investments cost or amortized cost, to be an other-than-temporary impairment of the investment and write the investment down to its fair value.
In addition to the usual investment risk associated with a debt instrument, our perpetual security holdings may be subject to the risk of nationalization of their issuers in connection with capital injections from an issuers sovereign government. We cannot be assured that such capital support will extend to all levels of an issuers capital structure. In addition, certain governments or regulators may consider imposing interest and principal payment restrictions on issuers of hybrid securities to preserve cash and build capital. In addition to the cash flow impact that additional deferrals would have on our portfolio, such deferrals could result in ratings downgrades of the affected securities, which in turn could impair the fair value of the securities and increase our regulatory capital requirements. We take factors such as these into account in our credit review process.
When determining our intention to sell a security prior to recovery of its fair value to amortized cost, we evaluate facts and circumstances such as, but not limited to, decisions to reposition our security portfolio and sales of securities to meet cash flow needs. We perform ongoing analyses of our liquidity needs, which includes cash flow testing of our policy liabilities, debt maturities, projected dividend payments and other cash flow and liquidity needs. Our cash flow testing includes extensive duration matching of our investment portfolio and policy liabilities. Based on our analyses, we have concluded that we have sufficient excess cash flows to meet our liquidity needs without liquidating any of our investments prior to their maturity. In years prior to 2011, provided that our credit review process resulted in a conclusion that we would collect all of our cash flows and recover our investment in an issuer and the investment was within our investment risk exposure guidelines, we generally did not sell investments prior to their maturity. However, in 2011, we determined that certain securities were no longer within our investment risk exposure guidelines and have started to reposition our security portfolio in an effort to enhance diversification and our credit profile by reducing our risk exposure through opportunistic investment transactions.
The following table details our pretax other-than-temporary impairment losses by investment category that resulted from our impairment evaluation process for the years ended December31.

In addition, because we do not intend to sell and do not believe it is likely that we will be required to sell these investments before a recovery of fair value to amortized cost, we do not consider any of these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of and for the year ended December31, 2011. The following summarizes our evaluation of investment categories with significant unrealized losses and securities that were rated below investment grade as of December 31, 2011.
Public Utilities As of December31, 2011, 77% of the unrealized losses on investments in the public utilities sector was related to investments that were investment grade, compared with 100% at December31, 2010. For any credit-related declines in fair value, we perform a more focused review of the related issuers credit ratings, financial statements and other available financial data, timeliness of payment, competitive environment and any other significant data related to the issuer. From those reviews, we evaluate the issuers continued ability to service our investments. We have determined that the majority of the unrealized losses on the investments in the public utilities sector was caused by a decline in creditworthiness of a couple issuers in this sector. Also impacting the unrealized losses in the public utilities sector was widening credit spreads. Based on our credit analysis, we believe that our investments in this sector have the ability to service their obligations to us.
110 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Bank and Financial Institution Investments The following table shows the composition of our investments in an unrealized loss position in the bank and financial institution sector by fixed-maturity securities and perpetual securities. The table reflects those securities in that sector that were in an unrealized loss position as a percentage of our total investment portfolio in an unrealized loss position and their respective unrealized losses as a percentage of total unrealized losses at December31.
2011 2010 Percentageof TotalInvestmentsin an Unrealized Loss Position Percentageof Total Unrealized Losses Percentageof TotalInvestmentsin an Unrealized Loss Position Percentageof Total Unrealized Losses Fixed maturities 37 % 44 % 39 % 54 % Perpetual securities: Upper Tier II 4 6 9 10 Tier I 5 12 5 7 Total perpetualsecurities 9 18 14 17 Total 46 % 62 % 53 % 71 % As of December31, 2011, 80% of the $2.2 billion in unrealized losses on investments in the bank and financial institution sector, including perpetual securities, was related to investments that were investment grade, compared with 53% at December31, 2010. This improvement is primarily due to the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments and sales of bank and financial institution securities during 2011. Of the $14 billion in investments, at fair value, in the bank and financial institution sector in an unrealized loss position at December31, 2011, only $1.1 billion ($.4 billion in unrealized losses) was below investment grade. Five issuers of investments comprised over 99% of the $.4 billion unrealized loss. We conduct our own independent credit analysis for investments in the bank and financial institution sector. Our assessment includes analysis of financial information, as well as consultation with the issuers from time to time. Based on our credit analysis, we have determined that the majority of the unrealized losses on the investments in this sector was caused by widening credit spreads, the downturn in the global economic environment and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. Unrealized gains or losses related to prevailing interest rate environments are impacted by the remaining time to maturity of an investment. Assuming no credit-related factors develop, as investments near maturity, the unrealized gains or losses can be expected to diminish. Based on our credit analysis, we believe that our investments in this sector have the ability to service their obligations to us.
Other Corporate Investments As of December31, 2011, 73% of the unrealized losses on investments in the other corporate sector was related to investments that were investment grade, compared with 51% at December31, 2010. For any credit-related declines in fair value, we perform a more focused review of the related issuers credit ratings, financial statements and other available financial data, timeliness of payment, competitive environment and any other significant data related to the issuers. From those reviews, we evaluate the issuers continued ability to service our investments. We have determined that the majority of the unrealized losses on the investments in the other corporate sector was caused by widening credit spreads. Also impacting the unrealized losses in this sector is the decline in creditworthiness of certain issuers in the other corporate sector. Based on our credit analysis, we believe that our investments in this sector have the ability to service their obligation to us.
Perpetual Securities As of December31, 2011, 73% of the unrealized losses on investments in perpetual securities was related to investments that were investment grade, compared with 83% at December31, 2010. The majority of our investments in Upper Tier II and Tier I perpetual securities were in highly rated global financial institutions. Upper Tier II securities have more debt-like characteristics than Tier I securities and are senior to Tier I securities, preferred stock, and common equity of the issuer. Conversely, Tier I securities have more equity-like characteristics, but are senior to the common equity of the issuer. They may also be senior to certain preferred shares, depending on the individual security, the issuers capital structure and the regulatory jurisdiction of the issuer.

With the exception of the Icelandic bank securities that we completely impaired in 2008, none of the perpetual securities we own were in default on interest and principal payments at December31, 2011. During the second quarter of 2011, we wrote off accrued interest income and stopped accruing further interest income for the Dexia S.A. Upper Tier II perpetual securities which have a deferred coupon and were impaired during that quarter. We recognized additional impairments on those securities in the third and fourth quarters of 2011. Based on amortized cost as of December31, 2011, the geographic breakdown of our perpetual securities by issuer was as follows: European countries, excluding the United Kingdom (69%); the United Kingdom (9%); Japan (15%); and other (7%). To determine any credit-related declines in fair value, we perform a more focused review of the related issuers credit ratings, financial statements and other available financial data, timeliness of payment, competitive environment and any other significant data related to the issuer. From those reviews, we evaluate the issuers continued ability to service our investment.
We have determined that the majority of our unrealized losses in the perpetual security category was principally due to widening credit spreads, largely as the result of the contraction of liquidity in the capital markets. Based on our reviews, we concluded that the ability of the issuers to service our investment has not been compromised by these factors. Unrealized gains or losses related to prevailing interest rate environments are impacted by the remaining time to maturity of an investment. Assuming no credit-related factors develop, as the investments near economic maturity, the unrealized gains or losses can be expected to diminish. Based on our credit analyses, we believe that our investments in this sector have the ability to service their obligations to us.
Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) As discussed in Note 1, effective January1, 2010, we have consolidated all of the components of each former QSPE investment, including a fixed-maturity or perpetual investment and a corresponding derivative transaction. Our risk of loss over the life of each investment is limited to the amount of our original investment. In addition, new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE that was effective January1, 2010, has resulted in the consolidation of additional VIE investments.
112 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table details our investments in VIEs as of December31.
Investments in Variable Interest Entities 2011 2010 (In millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value VIEs: Consolidated: Total VIEs consolidated $ 6,997 $ 7,206 $ 7,201 $ 7,363 Not consolidated: CDOs 0 0 5 5 Other 13,753 13,714 13,914 13,214 Total VIEs not consolidated 13,753 13,714 13,919 13,219 Total VIEs $ 20,750 $ 20,920 $ 21,120 $ 20,582 As a condition to our involvement or investment in a VIE, we enter into certain protective rights and covenants that preclude changes in the structure of the VIE that would alter the creditworthiness of our investment or our beneficial interest in the VIE.
Our involvement with all of the VIEs in which we have an interest is passive in nature, and we are not the arranger of these entities. We have not been involved in establishing these entities, except as it relates to our review and evaluation of the structure of these VIEs in the normal course of our investment decision-making process. Further, we have not been nor are we required to purchase any securities issued in the future by these VIEs.
Our ownership interest in the VIEs is limited to holding the obligations issued by them. All of the VIEs in which we invest are static with respect to funding and have no ongoing forms of funding after the initial funding date. We have no direct or contingent obligations to fund the limited activities of these VIEs, nor do we have any direct or indirect financial guarantees related to the limited activities of these VIEs. We have not provided any assistance or any other type of financing support to any of the VIEs we invest in, nor do we have any intention to do so in the future. The weighted-average lives of our notes are very similar to the underlying collateral held by these VIEs where applicable.
Our risk of loss related to our interests in any of our VIEs is limited to our investment in the debt securities issued by them.
VIEs - Consolidated We are substantively the only investor in the consolidated VIEs listed in the table above. As the sole investor in these VIEs, we have the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and are therefore considered to be the primary beneficiary of the VIEs that we consolidate. We also participate in substantially all of the variability created by these VIEs. The activities of these VIEs are limited to holding debt and perpetual securities and interest rate, foreign currency, and/or credit default swaps (CDSs), as appropriate, and utilizing the cash flows from these securities to service our investment. Neither we nor any of our creditors are able to obtain the underlying collateral of the VIEs unless there is an event of default or other specified event. For those VIEs that contain a swap, we are not a direct counterparty to the swap contracts and have no control over them. Our loss exposure to these VIEs is limited to our original investment. Our consolidated VIEs do not rely on outside or ongoing sources of funding to support their activities beyond the underlying collateral and swap contracts, if applicable. With the exception of our investment in senior secured bank loans through a unit trust structure that we began investing in during the second quarter of 2011, the underlying collateral assets and funding of our consolidated VIEs are generally static in nature and the underlying collateral and the reference corporate entities covered by any CDS contracts were all investment grade at the time of issuance.
113 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We are exposed to credit losses within any consolidated collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that could result in principal losses to our investments. We have mitigated our risk of credit loss through the structure of the VIE, which contractually requires the subordinated tranches within these VIEs to absorb the majority of the expected losses from the underlying credit default swaps. We currently own only senior CDO tranches. Based on our statistical analysis models, each of these VIEs can sustain a reasonable number of defaults in the underlying reference corporate entities in the CDSs with no loss to our investment.
VIEs  Not Consolidated The VIEs that we are not required to consolidate are investments that are limited to loans in the form of debt obligations from the VIEs that are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by their corporate parents. These VIEs are the primary financing vehicles used by their corporate sponsors to raise financing in the international capital markets. The variable interests created by these VIEs are principally or solely a result of the debt instruments issued by them. We do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance, nor do we have (1)the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or (2)the right to receive benefits from the entity. As such, we are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and are therefore not required to consolidate them. These VIE investments are comprised of securities from 161 separate issuers which have an average credit rating of A.
Securities Lending and Pledged Securities We lend fixed-maturity securities to financial institutions in short-term security-lending transactions. These short-term security-lending arrangements increase investment income with minimal risk. Our security lending policy requires that the fair value of the securities and/or unrestricted cash received as collateral be 102% or more of the fair value of the loaned securities. The following table presents our security loans outstanding and the corresponding collateral held as of December31: (In millions) 2011 2010 Security loans outstanding, fair value $ 812 $ 186 Cash collateral on loaned securities 838 191 At December31, 2011, debt securities with a fair value of $20 million were on deposit with regulatory authorities in the United States and Japan. We retain ownership of all securities on deposit and receive the related investment income.
For general information regarding our investment accounting policies, see Note 1.
4. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, nor do we engage in leveraged derivative transactions. The majority of our freestanding derivatives are interest rate, foreign currency and credit default swaps that are associated with investments in special-purpose entities, including VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. The remaining derivatives are interest rate swaps associated with our variable interest rate yen-denominated debt.
Derivative Types Interest rate and credit default swaps involve the periodic exchange of cash flows with other parties, at specified intervals, calculated using agreed upon rates or other financial variables and notional principal amounts. Generally, no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value. Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts on floating-rate fixed-maturity securities contracts to fixed rates. These derivatives are predominantly used to better match cash receipts from assets with cash disbursements required to fund liabilities.
Credit default swaps are used to assume credit risk related to an individual security or an index. These contracts entitle the consolidated VIE to receive a periodic fee in exchange for an obligation to compensate the derivative 114 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements counterparty should the referenced security issuers experience a credit event, as defined in the contract. The consolidated VIE is also exposed to credit risk due to embedded derivatives associated with credit-linked notes.
Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be periodic exchanges of payments at specified intervals based on the agreed upon rates and notional amounts. Foreign currency swaps are used primarily in the consolidated VIEs in our Aflac Japan portfolio to convert foreign denominated cash flows to yen, the functional currency of Aflac Japan, in order to minimize cash flow fluctuations.
Credit Risk Assumed through Derivatives Our exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to our interest rate swap associated with our variable interest rate Samurai notes as of December31, 2011, was immaterial. See the Hedging section of this Note for more information on this swap. For the interest rate, foreign currency, and credit default swaps associated with our VIE investments for which we are the primary beneficiary, we do not bear the risk of loss for counterparty default. We are not a direct counterparty to those contracts.
As a result of consolidation of certain VIE investments on January1, 2010, we began recognizing related credit default swaps that assume credit risk from an asset pool. Those consolidated VIEs will receive periodic payments based on an agreed upon rate and notional amount and will only make a payment by delivery of associated collateral, which consists of highly rated asset-backed securities, if there is a credit event. A credit event payment will typically be equal to the notional value of the swap contract less the value of the referenced obligations. A credit event is generally defined as a default on contractually obligated interest or principal payments or bankruptcy of the referenced entity.

The fair value amounts presented do not include income accruals. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated. Notional amounts are not reflective of credit risk. The change in the value of the notional amounts from December31, 2010 to December31, 2011 was due to foreign exchange and terminations of hedging activity and swap contracts in the consolidated VIE structures.

For those that have qualified, we have designated the derivative as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset (cash flow hedge). We expect to continue this hedging activity for a weighted-average period of approximately 14 years. The remaining derivatives in our consolidated VIEs that have not qualified for hedge accounting have been designated as held for other investment purposes (non-qualifying strategies).
We had interest rate swap agreements related to our 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes that matured in September 2011, and we have an interest rate swap agreement related to our 5.5 billion yen variable interest rate Samurai notes that we issued in July 2011 (see Note 8). By entering into these contracts, we swapped the variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate of 1.52% for the Uridashi notes and 1.475% for the Samurai notes. We designated these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with the respective variable interest rate notes. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the corresponding variable interest rate notes, and the swaps had no value at inception. Changes in the fair value of the swap contracts are recorded in other comprehensive income so long as the hedge is deemed effective. Should any portion of the hedge be deemed ineffective, that value would be reported in net earnings.
Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated changes in cash flow of the hedged item. At hedge inception, we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. The documentation process includes linking derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the statement of financial position or to specific forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness and ineffectiveness testing methods to be used. At the hedges inception and on an ongoing quarterly basis, we also formally assess whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is assessed using qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods may include the comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item. Quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in cash flows associated with the hedge relationship. Hedge ineffectiveness of the hedge relationships is measured each reporting period using the Hypothetical Derivative Method.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings as a component of realized investment gains (losses). All components of each derivatives gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1)it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item; (2)the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument; or (3)the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
When hedge accounting is discontinued on a cash-flow hedge, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the cash flow of the hedged item.
Cash Flow Hedges The only cash flow hedges that we had in 2009 were related to the interest rate swaps on our variable interest rate Uridashi debt. These hedges were effective during that year, and the unrealized loss recognized for those interest rate swaps in other comprehensive income was immaterial for the year ended December31, 2009. Upon consolidation of certain VIEs and their related interest rate, foreign currency, and credit default swaps on January1, 2010, some of the interest rate and foreign currency swaps qualified for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges. The following table presents the components of the gain or loss on derivatives that qualified as cash flow hedges for the years ended December31.

As a result, the net gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for these swaps that are no longer employing hedge accounting is being amortized into earnings over the expected life of the respective hedged item. The amount amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings related to these swaps was immaterial in 2011. Furthermore, there was no gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings related to our designated cash flow hedges for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. As of December31, 2011, deferred net gains on derivative instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are immaterial.
Non-qualifying Strategies For our derivative instruments in consolidated VIEs that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all changes in their fair value are reported in current period earnings as realized investment gains (losses). The following table presents the gain or loss recognized in income on non-qualifying strategies for the years ended December31.

While the change in value of the swaps is recorded through current period earnings, the change in value of the available-for-sale fixed income or perpetual securities associated with these swaps is recorded through other comprehensive income.
Nonderivative Hedges Our primary exposure to be hedged is our net investment in Aflac Japan, which is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. To mitigate this exposure, we have taken the following courses of action. First, Aflac Japan maintains an investment portfolio of dollar-denominated securities on behalf of Aflac U.S., which serves as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. The functional currency for these investments is the U.S. dollar. The related investment income and realized/unrealized investment gains and losses are also denominated in U.S. dollars. The foreign exchange gains and losses related to this portfolio are taxable in Japan and the U.S. when the securities mature or are sold. Until maturity or sale, deferred tax expense or benefit associated with the foreign exchange gains or losses are recognized in other comprehensive income.
Second, we have designated a majority of the Parent Companys yen-denominated liabilities (Samurai and Uridashi notes and yen-denominated loans - see Note 8) as nonderivative hedges of the foreign currency exposure 118 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements of our investment in Aflac Japan. Our net investment hedge was effective during the years ended December31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. We recognized an immaterial amount in net earnings for the negative foreign exchange effect on the Parent Company yen-denominated liabilities that exceeded our yen net asset position in Aflac Japan in certain quarters of 2011 and 2009. There was no gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings related to our net investment hedge for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
For additional information on our financial instruments, see the accompanying Notes 1, 3 and 5.
5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS We determine the fair values of our debt, derivative, perpetual and privately issued equity securities primarily using four pricing approaches or techniques: quoted market prices readily available from public exchange markets, price quotes and valuations from third party pricing vendors, a discounted cash flow (DCF) pricing model, and non-binding price quotes we obtain from outside brokers.
Our DCF pricing model incorporates an option adjusted spread and utilizes various market inputs we obtain from both active and inactive markets. The estimated fair values developed by the DCF pricing model is most sensitive to prevailing credit spreads, the level of interest rates (yields) and interest rate volatility. Prior to March31, 2010, credit spreads were derived based on pricing data obtained from investment brokers and took into account the current yield curve, time to maturity and subordination levels for similar securities or classes of securities. Subsequent to March31, 2010, credit spreads were derived from using a bond index to create a credit spread matrix which takes into account the current credit spread, ratings and remaining time to maturity, and subordination levels for securities that are included in the bond index. Our DCF pricing model is based on a widely used global bond index that is comprised of investments in active markets. The index provides a broad-based measure of the global fixed-income bond market. This bond index covers bonds issued by European and American issuers, which account for the majority of bonds that we hold. We validate the reliability of the DCF pricing model periodically by using the model to price investments for which there are quoted market prices from active and inactive markets or, in the alternative, are quoted by our custodian for the same or similar securities.
The pricing data and market quotes we obtain from outside sources are reviewed internally for reasonableness. If a fair value appears unreasonable, we will re-examine the inputs and assess the reasonableness of the pricing data with the vendor. Additionally, we may compare the inputs to relevant market indices and other performance measurements. Based on that analysis, the valuation is confirmed or revised.
Fair Value Hierarchy GAAP specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. These two types of inputs create three valuation hierarchy levels. Level 1 valuations reflect quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 valuations reflect quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets or model-derived valuations in which all significant valuation inputs are observable in active markets. Level 3 valuations reflect valuations in which one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in an active market. The vast majority of our financial instruments subject to the classification provisions of GAAP relate to our investment securities classified as securities available for sale in our investment portfolio. We determine the fair value of our securities available for sale using several sources or techniques based on the type and nature of the investment securities.
119 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following tables present the fair value hierarchy levels of the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31.

The custodian obtains price quotes from various third party pricing services that estimate fair values based on observable market transactions for similar investments in active markets, market transactions for the same investments in inactive markets, or other observable market data where available. The fair value of approximately 45% of our Level 2 fixed income and perpetual investments, or 11% of the number of Level 2 holdings, are determined using our DCF pricing model. The significant valuation inputs to the DCF model are obtained from, or corroborated by, observable market sources from both active and inactive markets. For the remaining 6% of Level 2 investment valuations, or 12% of the number of Level 2 holdings, that are not provided by our custodian and are not priced using the DCF pricing model, we obtain quotes from other pricing services that estimate fair values based on observable market transactions for similar investments in active markets, market transactions for the same investments in inactive markets, or other observable market data where available.
Due to our reliance on third-party pricing services to provide valuations on 49% of our Level 2 portfolio, we regularly discuss and review pricing methodologies with the investment custodian. We also review the custodians Service Organization Control (SOC 1) report for the period covering the current year to gain satisfaction with the controls and control environment of the custodian.
121 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For securities in Level 2 that are below investment grade or have split ratings where the valuation calculated by our DCF model does not conform to current market conditions, a CDS spread is used in lieu of the index spread discussed above. The CDS is chosen based on an average of spreads of issues with the same issuer, rating and subordination.
We use derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with certain assets. However, the derivative instrument may not be classified with the same fair value hierarchy as the associated asset. Inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currency forward and spot rates, and interest volatility. For derivatives associated with VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary, we are not the direct counterparty to the swap contracts. As a result, the fair value measurements incorporate the credit risk of the collateral associated with the VIE and counterparty credit risk.
Prior to the third quarter of 2011, our derivative instruments were reported in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, except CDSs and certain foreign currency swaps which were classified as Level 3. The interest rate and certain foreign currency derivative instruments previously classified as Level 2 were priced by broker quotations. In the third quarter of 2011, we changed from receiving valuations from brokers to receiving valuations from a third party pricing vendor for our derivatives. Based on an analysis of these derivatives and a review of the methodology employed by the pricing vendor, we determined that due to the long duration of these swaps and the need to extrapolate from short-term observable data to derive and measure long-term inputs, certain inputs, assumptions and judgments are required to value future cash flows that cannot be corroborated by current inputs or current observable market data. As a result, our derivatives are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of December31, 2011.
The fixed maturities classified as Level 3 consist of securities for which there are limited or no observable valuation inputs. We estimate the fair value of these securities by obtaining non-binding broker quotes from a limited number of brokers. These brokers base their quotes on a combination of their knowledge of the current pricing environment and market conditions. We consider these inputs unobservable. The significant valuation inputs that are used in the valuation process for the below-investment-grade and private placement investments classified as Level 3 include forward exchange rates, yen swap rates, dollar swap rates, interest rate volatilities, credit spread data on specific issuers, assumed default and default recovery rates, and certain probability assumptions. In obtaining these valuation inputs, we have determined that certain pricing assumptions and data used by our pricing sources are difficult to validate or corroborate by the market and/or appear to be internally developed rather than observed in or corroborated by the market. The use of these unobservable valuation inputs causes more subjectivity in the valuation process for these securities.
The equity securities classified in Level 3 are related to investments in Japanese businesses, each of which are insignificant and in the aggregate are immaterial. Because fair values for these investments are not readily available, we carry them at their original cost. We review each of these investments periodically and, in the event we determine that any are other-than-temporarily impaired, we write them down to their estimated fair value at that time.
Historically, we have not adjusted the quotes or prices we obtain from the brokers and pricing services we use.

Transfers into and/or out of any fair value hierarchy level are assumed to occur at the balance sheet date.
In 2011 and 2010, transfers into Level3 from Level 2 resulted primarily from current market conditions characterized by a lack of trading activity, decreased liquidity, and credit ratings downgrades on certain of our fixed income securities which have resulted in decreased transparency of valuations and an increased use of broker quotations or management estimates and unobservable inputs to determine estimated fair value.
The most significant transfer into Level 3 in 2011 related to our reverse dual-currency (RDC) holdings. These securities are valued using a 60-day historical volatility to produce a binomial tree of possible foreign exchange scenarios over a specified time interval. The market standard approach is to use implied volatility to value options or instruments with optionality. Due to the use of historical volatility as a significant input to the valuation and due to it not being previously identified as being a significant unobservable input, these holdings were transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy effective December 31, 2011. These RDC securities had a fair value of $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The remaining transfers of fixed maturity securities into Level 3 from Level 2 in 2011 were a result of using broker quotes for valuation instead of using custodian or DCF valuations.
In 2011, we transferred securities out of Level 3 into Level 2 as a result of changing our pricing methodology from obtaining pricing from brokers or arrangers to using a third party pricing vendor that estimates fair values based on observable market transactions for similar investments in active markets, market transactions for the same investments in inactive markets, or other observable market data where available. In 2010, we transferred securities out of Level 3 into Level 2 as a result of changing our pricing methodology from obtaining pricing from brokers or arrangers to using our DCF pricing model for estimating fair value.
As discussed in Notes 1 and 3, we adopted new accounting guidance on VIEs effective January1, 2010, and as a result have consolidated certain VIE investments. Upon consolidation, the beneficial interest was derecognized and the underlying securities and derivatives were recognized. In many cases, the fair value hierarchy level differed between the original beneficial interest asset and the underlying securities that are now being recognized.In the 124 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Level 3 rollforward, we have separately disclosed the impact of consolidating these VIE investments that were previously categorized as Level 3 and now the underlying securities are Level 2. As noted in the Level 3 rollforward above, the CDSs which are separately recognized as a result of this change in accounting are reported as Level 3 investments. In addition, approximately $1.0 billion of Level 2 investments were reclassified upon the adoption of this guidance, and their underlying securities are being reported as Level 1 as of January1, 2010.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values and estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments as of December31 were as follows: 2011 2010 (In millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Assets: Fixed-maturity securities $ 88,588 $ 88,039 $ 72,570 $ 72,999 Fixed-maturity securities - consolidated variable interest entities 5,993 5,916 5,869 5,825 Perpetual securities 5,149 5,149 5,974 5,974 Perpetual securities - consolidated variable interest entities 1,290 1,290 1,538 1,538 Equity securities 25 25 23 23 Interest rate, foreign currency, and credit default swaps 375 375 564 564 Liabilities: Notes payable (excluding capitalized leases) 3,275 3,536 3,032 3,248 Interest rate, foreign currency, and credit default swaps 531 531 741 741 Obligation to Japanese policyholder protection corporation 71 71 108 108 As mentioned previously, we determine the fair values of our fixed maturity securities, perpetual securities, privately issued equity securities and our derivatives using four basic pricing approaches or techniques: quoted market prices readily available from public exchange markets, price quotes and valuations from third party pricing vendors, pricing models, and price quotes we obtain from outside brokers.
The fair values of our publicly issued notes payable were obtained from a limited number of independent brokers, and the fair values of our yen-denominated loans approximate their carrying values. The fair value of the obligation to the Japanese policyholder protection corporation is our estimated share of the industrys obligation calculated on a pro rata basis by projecting our percentage of the industrys premiums and reserves and applying that percentage to the total industry obligation payable in future years.
The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accrued investment income, accounts payable, cash collateral and payables for security transactions approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Consequently, such instruments are not included in the above table. The preceding table also excludes liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims as these liabilities are not financial instruments as defined by GAAP.
DCF Sensitivity Our DCF pricing model utilizes various market inputs we obtain from both active and inactive markets. The estimated fair values developed by the DCF pricing models are most sensitive to prevailing credit spreads, the level of interest rates (yields), and, for our callable securities, interest rate volatility. Management believes that under normal market conditions, a movement of 50 basis points (bps) in interest rates and credit spreads and 50 percent in interest rate volatility would be sufficiently reasonable stresses to illustrate the sensitivity of valuations to these risk factors. Therefore, we selected these magnitudes of movements and provided both upward and downward movements in these key assumptions used to estimate fair value. Since the changes in fair value are relatively linear, readers of these financial statements can make their own judgments as to the movement in interest rates and the change in fair value based upon this data. The following scenarios provide a view of the sensitivity of our securities priced by our DCF pricing model.
125 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The fair values of our available-for-sale fixed-maturity and perpetual securities valued by our DCF pricing model totaled $19.7 billion at December31, 2011. The estimated effect of potential changes in interest rates, credit spreads and interest rate volatility on these fair values as of such date is as follows: Interest Rates Credit Spreads Interest Rate Volatility Factor change Change in fair value (inmillions) Factor change Change in fair value (inmillions) Factor change Change in fair value (inmillions) +50 bps $ (1,035 ) +50bps $ (1,027 ) +50 % $ (125 ) -50 bps 1,095 -50bps 1,090 -50 % 6 The fair values of our held-to-maturity fixed-maturity securities valued by our DCF pricing model totaled $25.8 billion at December31, 2011. The estimated effect of potential changes in interest rates, credit spreads and interest rate volatility on these fair values as of such date is as follows: Interest Rates Credit Spreads Interest Rate Volatility Factor change Change in fairvalue (inmillions) Factor change Change in fairvalue (inmillions) Factor change Change in fairvalue (inmillions) +50 bps $ (1,596 ) +50bps $ (1,485 ) +50 % $ (126 ) -50 bps 1,631 -50 bps 1,489 -50 % 165 For additional information on our investments and financial instruments, see the accompanying Notes 1, 3 and4.
6. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS AND INSURANCE EXPENSES Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Insurance Expenses: Consolidated policy acquisition costs deferred during the year were $1.68 billion in 2011, compared with $1.44 billion in 2010 and $1.30 billion in 2009.

POLICY LIABILITIES Policy liabilities primarily include future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, which accounted for 84% and 4% of total policy liabilities at December31, 2011, respectively. We regularly review the adequacy of our policy liabilities in total and by component. The liability for future policy benefits as of December31 consisted of the following: Liability Amounts Interest Rates (In millions) Policy Issue Year 2011 2010 Yearof Issue In 20 Years Health insurance: Japan: 2005-2011 $ 2,441 $ 1,577 1.5-2.75 % 1.5-2.75 % 1974-2011 18,777 13,034 3.0 3.0 1997-1999 3,885 3,942 3.5 3.5 1994-1996 4,749 6,083 4.0 - 4.5 4.0 - 4.5 1987-1994 24,607 24,420 5.25 - 5.5 5.25 - 5.5 1978-1986 5,761 5,634 6.5 - 6.75 5.5 1974-1979 0 993 7.0 5.0 U.S.: 2005-2011 2,713 2,293 4.75 - 5.5 4.75 - 5.5 1998-2004 1,148 1,123 7.0 7.0 1988-2004 777 845 8.0 6.0 1986-2004 1,328 1,337 6.0 6.0 1985-1986 23 24 6.5 6.5 1981-1986 181 188 7.0 5.5 Other 24 26 Life insurance: Japan: 2011 122 0 2.0 2.0 2009-2010 823 262 2.25 2.25 2007-2011 896 503 2.75 2.75 2005-2011 1,079 753 2.5 2.5 2001-2011 1,501 1,163 1.65 - 1.85 1.65 - 1.85 1985-2011 5,795 2,543 3.0 3.0 1996-2009 962 904 3.5 3.5 1994-1996 1,395 1,334 4.0 - 4.5 4.0 - 4.5 1985-1993 0 2,877 5.25-5.65 5.25-5.65 U.S.: 1956-2011 291 245 4.0 - 6.0 4.0 - 6.0 Total $ 79,278 $ 72,103 127 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The weighted-average interest rates reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings for future policy benefits for Japanese policies were 4.0% in 2011, 4.4% in 2010 and 4.5% in 2009; and for U.S. policies, 6.0% in 2011 and 2010 and 6.1% in 2009. The decline in Aflac Japans interest rates from 2010 to 2011 was the result of the strengthening of future policy benefit reserves primarily for a closed block of cancer policies and a block of care policies.
Changes in the liability for unpaid policy claims were as follows for the years ended December31: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Unpaid supplemental health claims, beginning of year $ 3,524 $ 3,105 $ 2,959 Add claims incurred during the year related to: Current year 7,703 7,262 6,864 Prior years (256 ) (332 ) (398 ) Total incurred 7,447 6,930 6,466 Less claims paid during the year on claims incurred during: Current year 5,401 5,003 4,683 Prior years 1,944 1,787 1,618 Total paid 7,345 6,790 6,301 Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on unpaid claims 123 279 (19 ) Unpaid supplemental health claims, end of year 3,749 3,524 3,105 Unpaid life claims, end of year 232 195 165 Total liability for unpaid policy claims $ 3,981 $ 3,719 $ 3,270 The incurred claims development related to prior years reflects favorable development in the unpaid policy claims liability previously provided for. There are no additional or return of premium considerations associated with that development.
8. NOTES PAYABLE A summary of notes payable as of December31 follows: (In millions) 2011 2010 8.50% senior notes due May 2019 $ 850 $ 850 6.45% senior notes due August 2040 448 (1) 448 (1) 6.90% senior notes due December 2039 396 (2) 396 (2) 3.45% senior notes due August 2015 300 300 Yen-denominated Uridashi notes: 1.52% notes paid September 2011 (principal amount 15 billion yen) 0 184 2.26% notes due September 2016 (principal amount 8 billion yen) 103 98 Variable interest rate notes paid September 2011 (.66% at December 2010, principal amount 20 billion yen) 0 245 Yen-denominated Samurai notes: 1.47% notes due July 2014 (principal amount 28.7 billion yen) 369 0 1.87% notes due June 2012 (principal amount 26.6 billion yen) 342 327 1.84% notes due July 2016 (principal amount 15.8 billion yen) 203 0 Variable interest rate notes due July 2014 (1.34% at December 2011, principal amount 5.5 billion yen) 71 0 Yen-denominated loans: 3.60% loan due July 2015 (principal amount 10 billion yen) 129 123 3.00% loan due August 2015 (principal amount 5 billion yen) 64 61 Capitalized lease obligations payable through 2022 10 6 Total notes payable $ 3,285 $ 3,038 (1) $450 issuance net of a $2 underwriting discount that is being amortized over the life of the notes (2) $400 issuance net of a $4 underwriting discount that is being amortized over the life of the notes 128 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In July 2011, the Parent Company issued three series of Samurai notes totaling 50 billion yen through a public debt offering. The first series, which totaled 28.7 billion yen, bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.47%per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a three-year maturity. The second series, which totaled 15.8 billion yen, bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.84%per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a five-year maturity. The third series, which totaled 5.5 billion yen, bears interest at a variable rate of three-month yen LIBOR plus a spread, payable quarterly, and has a three-year maturity. We have entered into an interest rate swap related to the 5.5 billion yen variable interest rate notes to swap the variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate of 1.475% (see Note 4). These Samurai notes are not available to U.S. persons.
In 2010 and 2009, we issued a total of $2.0 billion of senior notes through U.S. public debt offerings. The details of these notes are as follows. In August 2010, we issued $450 million and $300 million of senior notes that have 30-year and five-year maturities, respectively. In December 2009, we issued $400 million of senior notes that have a 30-year maturity. In May 2009, we issued $850 million of senior notes that have a 10-year maturity. These senior notes pay interest semi-annually and are redeemable at our option in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i)the principal amount of the notes or (ii)the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to be redeemed, discounted to the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
In September2006, the Parent Company issued three tranches of Uridashi notes totaling 45 billion yen. The first tranche totaled 15billion yen and had a five-year maturity. The second tranche totaled 10billion yen and has a 10-year maturity. The third tranche totaled 20billion yen and had a five-year maturity and a variable interest coupon of six-month yen LIBOR plus a spread. We had interest rate swaps related to the 20billion yen variable interest rate notes (see Note 4). Each outstanding tranche of Uridashi notes pays interest semiannually, may only be redeemed prior to maturity upon the occurrence of a tax event as specified in the respective bond agreement and is not available to U.S. persons. In September 2011, we redeemed the first and third tranches of these notes upon their maturity. The interest rate swap agreements expired with the redemption of the third tranche of Uridashi notes.
The Parent Company issued yen-denominated Samurai notes totaling 30billion yen in June 2007. The Samurai notes have a five-year-maturity, pay interest semiannually, may only be redeemed prior to maturity upon the occurrence of a tax event as specified in the respective bond agreement and are not available to U.S. persons.
During 2009, we extinguished portions of our yen-denominated Uridashi and Samurai debt by buying the notes on the open market. We extinguished 2.0 billion yen (par value) of our Uridashi notes due September 2016 at a cost of 1.4 billion yen, yielding a gain of .6 billion yen. We also extinguished 3.4 billion yen (par value) of our Samurai notes due June 2012 at a cost of 2.5 billion yen, yielding a gain of .9 billion yen.
For our yen-denominated loans, the principal amount as stated in dollar terms will fluctuate from period to period due to changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. We have designated the majority of our yen-denominated notes payable as a nonderivative hedge of the foreign currency exposure of our investment in Aflac Japan. We have also designated the interest rate swap on our variable interest rate Samurai notes as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with these notes.
The aggregate contractual maturities of notes payable during each of the years after December31, 2011, are as follows: (In millions) Long-term Debt Capitalized Lease Obligations Total Notes Payable 2012 $ 342 $ 3 $ 345 2013 0 3 3 2014 440 2 442 2015 493 1 494 2016 306 0 306 Thereafter 1,700 1 1,701 Total $ 3,281 $ 10 $ 3,291 We have no restrictive financial covenants related to our notes payable. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable at December31, 2011. No events of default or defaults occurred during 2011 and 2010.
129 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 9. INCOME TAXES The components of income tax expense (benefit) applicable to pretax earnings for the years ended December31 were as follows: (In millions) Japan U.S.
Total 2011: Current $358 $533 $891 Deferred (290 ) 427 137 Total income tax expense $68 $960 $1,028 2010: Current $ 513 $ 349 $ 862 Deferred 546 (167 ) 379 Total income tax expense $ 1,059 $ 182 $ 1,241 2009: Current $ 565 $ 265 $ 830 Deferred 62 (154 ) (92 ) Total income tax expense $ 627 $ 111 $ 738 Japan has enacted an income tax rate reduction effective for fiscal years beginning after March 31, 2012. The rate will be reduced to 33.3% effective April 1, 2012, with an additional reduction to 30.8% effective April 1, 2015. The estimated reversal of the temporary differences resulted in a decrease to deferred taxes in Japan of $744 million and a corresponding increase in U.S. deferred taxes, due to the loss of foreign tax credits, of $744 million as of December 31, 2011.
Income tax expense in the accompanying statements of earnings varies from the amount computed by applying the expected U.S. tax rate of 35% to pretax earnings. The principal reasons for the differences and the related tax effects for the years ended December31 were as follows: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Income taxes based on U.S. statutory rates $ 1,047 $ 1,255 $ 782 Utilization of foreign tax credit (36 ) (31 ) (29 ) Nondeductible expenses 10 10 11 Other, net 7 7 (26 ) Income tax expense $ 1,028 $ 1,241 $ 738 Total income tax expense for the years ended December31 was allocated as follows: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Statements of earnings $ 1,028 $ 1,241 $ 738 Other comprehensive income (loss): Unrealized foreign currency translation gains (losses) during period (185 ) (339 ) 39 Unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities: Unrealized holding gains (losses) on investment securities during period 1,016 447 728 Reclassification adjustment for realized (gains) losses on investment securities included in net earnings (404 ) (147 ) (424 ) Unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives during period (12 ) 18 0 Pension liability adjustment during period (23 ) (11 ) 8 Total income tax expense (benefit) related to items of other comprehensive income (loss) 392 (32 ) 351 Additional paid-in capital (exercise of stock options) (7 ) (31 ) (3 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 0 (89 ) 0 Total income taxes $ 1,413 $ 1,089 $ 1,086 130 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The tax effect on other comprehensive income (loss) shown in the table above included a deferred income tax benefit of $152 million in 2011, compared with a deferred income tax benefit of $322million in 2010 and a deferred income tax expense of $12 million in 2009, related to the dollar-denominated investment portfolio that Aflac Japan maintains on behalf of Aflac U.S. As discussed in Note 1, there is no translation adjustment to record in pretax other comprehensive income for the portfolio when the yen/dollar exchange rate changes, however deferred tax expense or benefit associated with the foreign exchange translation gains or losses on this dollar-denominated portfolio is recognized in total income tax expense on other comprehensive income until the securities mature or are sold. Excluding the tax amounts for this dollar-denominated investment portfolio from total taxes on other comprehensive income would result in an effective income tax rate on pretax other comprehensive income (loss) of 34% in 2011, 31% in 2010, and 35% in 2009.
The income tax effects of the temporary differences that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December31 were as follows: (In millions) 2011 2010 Deferred income tax liabilities: Deferred policy acquisition costs $ 3,104 $ 2,814 Unrealized gains on investment securities 397 114 Premiums receivable 153 151 Policy benefit reserves 1,896 1,583 Other 0 297 Total deferred income tax liabilities 5,550 4,959 Deferred income tax assets: Depreciation 134 144 Policyholder protection corporation obligation 5 22 Difference in tax basis of investment in Aflac Japan 47 244 Other basis differences in investment securities 1,363 1,557 Unfunded retirement benefits 44 44 Other accrued expenses 64 70 Policy and contract claims 106 107 Unrealized exchange loss on yen-denominated notes payable 124 142 Deferred compensation 201 168 Capital loss carryforwards 784 374 Other 405 385 Total deferred income tax assets 3,277 3,257 Net deferred income tax liability 2,273 1,702 Current income tax liability 340 267 Total income tax liability $ 2,613 $ 1,969 Under U.S. income tax rules, only 35% of non-life operating losses can be offset against life insurance taxable income each year. For current U.S. income tax purposes, there were non-life operating loss carryforwards of $17 million, $39 million and $34million expiring in 2029, 2030 and 2031, respectively, and no tax credit carryforwards available at December31, 2011. The Company has capital loss carryforwards of $2,240 million available to offset capital gains, of which $214 million expires in 2013, $299 million expires in 2014, $550 million expires in 2015, and $1,177 million expires in 2016. A total of $7 million in capital loss carryforwards expired in 2011.
We file federal income tax returns in the United States and Japan as well as state or prefecture income tax returns in various jurisdictions in the two countries. U.S. federal and state income tax returns for years before 2008 are no longer subject to examination. In Japan, the National Tax Agency (NTA) has completed exams through tax year 2009.
131 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows for the years ended December31: (In millions) 2011 2010 Balance, beginning of year $ 24 (1) $ 17 (1) Additions for tax positions of prior years 7 7 Settlements 0 0 Reductions for tax positions of prior years 0 0 Balance, end of year $ 31 (1) $ 24 (1) (1) Amounts do not include tax deductions of $10 at December31, 2011, $8 at December31, 2010, and $6 at January1, 2010.
Included in the balance of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2011, are $31 million of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility, compared with $24 million at December31, 2010. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate, but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. The Company has accrued approximately $2 million as of December31, 2011, for permanent uncertainties, which if reversed would not have a material effect on the annual effective rate.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We recognized approximately $5 million in interest and penalties in 2011, compared with $3 million in 2010 and $1 million in 2009. The Company has accrued approximately $19 million for the payment of interest and penalties as of December31, 2011, compared with $14 million a year ago.
As of December31, 2011, there were no material uncertain tax positions for which the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.
10. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY The following table is a reconciliation of the number of shares of the Companys common stock for the years ended December31.
(In thousands of shares) 2011 2010 2009 Common stock - issued: Balance, beginning of period 662,660 661,209 660,035 Exercise of stock options and issuance of restricted shares 979 1,451 1,174 Balance, end of period 663,639 662,660 661,209 Treasury stock: Balance, beginning of period 192,999 192,641 193,420 Purchases of treasury stock: Open market 6,000 2,000 0 Other 182 192 264 Dispositions of treasury stock: Shares issued to AFL Stock Plan (1,690 ) 0 (355 ) Exercise of stock options (88 ) (1,752 ) (556 ) Other (74 ) (82 ) (132 ) Balance, end of period 197,329 192,999 192,641 Shares outstanding, end of period 466,310 469,661 468,568 Outstanding share-based awards are excluded from the calculation of weighted-average shares used in the computation of basic earnings per share (EPS). The following table presents the approximate number of share-based awards to purchase shares, on a weighted-average basis, that were considered to be anti-dilutive and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share at December31: (In thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Anti-dilutive share-based awards 6,145 3,252 9,603 132 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The weighted-average shares used in calculating earnings per share for the years ended December31 were as follows: (In thousands of shares) 2011 2010 2009 Weighted-average outstanding shares used for calculating basic EPS 466,519 469,038 466,552 Dilutive effect of share-based awards 2,851 4,047 2,511 Weighted-average outstanding shares used for calculating diluted EPS 469,370 473,085 469,063 Share Repurchase Program: During 2011, we purchased 6.0million shares of our common stock in the open market, compared with 2.0million shares in 2010. We did not purchase any shares of our common stock in 2009 under our share repurchase program.
As of December31, 2011, a remaining balance of 24.4million shares of our common stock was available for purchase under a share repurchase authorization by our board of directors in 2008.
Voting Rights: In accordance with the Parent Companys articles of incorporation, shares of common stock are generally entitled to one vote per share until they have been held by the same beneficial owner for a continuous period of 48 months, at which time they become entitled to 10 votes per share.
11. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION As of December31, 2011, the Company has outstanding share-based awards under two long-term incentive compensation plans.
The first plan, which expired in February 2007, is a stock option plan which allowed grants for incentive stock options (ISOs) to employees and non-qualifying stock options (NQSOs) to employees and non-employee directors. The options have a term of 10 years and generally vest after three years. The exercise price of options granted under this plan is equal to the fair market value of a share of the Companys common stock at the date of grant. Options granted before the plans expiration date remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.
The second long-term incentive compensation plan allows awards to Company employees for ISOs, NQSOs, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights. Non-employee directors are eligible for grants of NQSOs, restricted stock, and stock appreciation rights. Generally, the awards vest based upon time-based conditions or time- and performance-based conditions. Performance-based vesting conditions generally include the attainment of goals related to Company financial performance. As of December31, 2011, approximately 14.9million shares were available for future grants under this plan, and the only performance-based awards issued and outstanding were restricted stock awards.
Share-based awards granted to U.S.-based grantees are settled with authorized but unissued Company stock, while those issued to Japan-based grantees are settled with treasury shares.
The following table presents the expense recognized in connection with share-based awards for the periods ended December31.

Expected volatility is based on historical periods generally commensurate with the estimated terms of the options. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and termination patterns within the model. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise patterns are stratified and considered separately for 133 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of our option model and represents the weighted-average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. We base the risk-free interest rate on the Treasury note rate with a term comparable to that of the estimated term of the options. The weighted-average fair value of options at their grant date was $17.02 for 2011, compared with $17.81 for 2010 and $8.89 in 2009.

We expect to recognize these amounts over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.1 years. There are no other contractual terms covering restricted stock awards once vested.
12. STATUTORY ACCOUNTING AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS Our insurance subsidiary is required to report its results of operations and financial position to state insurance regulatory authorities on the basis of statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by such authorities. Aflac's statutory financial statements are prepared on the basis of accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Nebraska Department of Insurance (NEDOI). The NEDOI recognizes statutory accounting principles and practices prescribed or permitted by the state of Nebraska for determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company, and for determining a companys solvency under Nebraska insurance law.The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual , (SAP) has been adopted by the state of Nebraska as a component of those prescribed or permitted practices.Additionally, the Director of the NEDOI has the right to permit other specific practices which deviate from prescribed practices. Aflac has been given explicit permission by the Director of the NEDOI for three such permitted practices. These permitted practices, which do not impact the calculation of net income on a statutory basis or prevent the triggering of a regulatory event in the Companys risk-based capital calculation, are as follows:  Aflac has reported as admitted assets the refundable lease deposits on the leases of commercial office space which house Aflac Japan's sales operations. These lease deposits are unique and part of the ordinary course of doing business in the country of Japan; these assets would be non-admitted under SAP.
135 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Aflac utilized book value accounting for certain guaranteed separate account funding agreements instead of fair value accounting as required by SAP.The underlying separate account assets had an unrealized gain of $45 million as of December31, 2011, compared with an unrealized loss of $113 million as of December31, 2010.
A reconciliation of Aflacs capital and surplus between SAP and practices permitted by the state of Nebraska is shown below: (In millions) 2011 2010 Capital and surplus, Nebraska state basis $6,371 $6,740 State Permitted Practice: Refundable lease deposits  Japan (53 ) (51 ) Separate Account Funding Agreements 45 (113 ) Capital and surplus, NAIC basis $6,363 $6,576 As determined on a U.S. statutory accounting basis, Aflacs net income was $444 million in 2011, $1.5 billion in 2010 and $1.4 billion in 2009. Capital and surplus was $6.4 billion at December31, 2011 and $6.7 billion at December31, 2010. The decrease in net income for 2011 was due to an increase in net realized investment losses.
Net assets of the insurance subsidiaries aggregated $15.9 billion at December31, 2011, on a GAAP basis, compared with $12.9 billion a year ago. Aflac Japan accounted for $11.0 billion, or 69.1% of net assets at December31, 2011, compared with $8.9 billion, or 68.5%, at December31, 2010.
Reconciliations of Aflacs net assets on a GAAP basis to capital and surplus determined on a Nebraska statutory accounting basis as of December31 were as follows: (In millions) 2011 2010 Net assets on GAAP basis $15,814 $ 12,902 Adjustment of carrying values of investments (1,707 ) 148 Elimination of deferred policy acquisition cost asset (10,417 ) (9,566 ) Adjustment to policy liabilities 2,286 2,309 Adjustment to deferred income taxes 728 670 Other, net (333 ) 277 Capital and surplus, Nebraska state basis $6,371 $6,740 Aflac Japan must report its results of operations and financial position to the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis as prescribed by the FSA. Capital and surplus (unaudited) of Aflac Japan, based on Japanese regulatory accounting practices, aggregated $2.7 billion at December31, 2011, and $2.3 billion at December31, 2010. Japanese regulatory accounting practices differ in many respects from U.S. GAAP. Under Japanese regulatory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are charged off immediately; deferred income tax liabilities are recognized on a different basis; policy benefit and claim reserving methods and assumptions are different; the carrying value of securities transferred to held to maturity is different; policyholder protection corporation obligations are not accrued; and premium income is recognized on a cash basis.
The Parent Company depends on its subsidiaries for cash flow, primarily in the form of dividends and management fees. Consolidated retained earnings in the accompanying financial statements largely represent the undistributed earnings of our insurance subsidiary. Amounts available for dividends, management fees and other payments to the Parent Company by its insurance subsidiary may fluctuate due to different accounting methods required by regulatory authorities. These payments are also subject to various regulatory restrictions and approvals related to safeguarding the interests of insurance policyholders. Our insurance subsidiary must maintain adequate risk-based capital for U.S. regulatory authorities and our Japan branch must maintain adequate solvency margins for Japanese regulatory authorities. Additionally, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid to the Parent Company by Aflac without prior approval of Nebraskas director of insurance is the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. Dividends declared by Aflac during 2012 in excess of $637 million would require such approval. Dividends declared by Aflac during 2011 were $282 million.
136 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements A portion of Aflac Japan earnings, as determined on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis, can be repatriated each year to Aflac U.S. after complying with solvency margin provisions and satisfying various conditions imposed by Japanese regulatory authorities for protecting policyholders. Profit repatriations to the United States can fluctuate due to changes in the amounts of Japanese regulatory earnings. Among other items, factors affecting regulatory earnings include Japanese regulatory accounting practices and fluctuations in currency translation of Aflac Japans dollar-denominated investments and related investment income into yen. Profits repatriated by Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S. were as follows for the years ended December31: In Dollars In Yen (In millions of dollars and billions of yen) 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Profit repatriation $ 143 $ 317 $ 230 11.0 28.7 20.0 13. BENEFIT PLANS Pension and Other Postretirement Plans We have funded defined benefit plans in Japan and the United States which cover substantially all of our full-time employees. Additionally, we maintain non-qualified, unfunded supplemental retirement plans that provide defined pension benefits in excess of limits imposed by federal tax law for certain Japanese, U.S. and former employees.
We provide certain health care benefits for eligible U.S. retired employees, their beneficiaries and covered dependents ("other postretirement benefits"). The health care plan is contributory and unfunded. Substantially all of our U.S. employees may become eligible to receive other postretirement benefits if they retire at age 55 or older with at least 15 years of service or if they retire when their age plus service, in years, equals or exceeds 80. At retirement, an employee is given an opportunity to elect continuation of coverage under our medical plan until age 65. For certain employees and former employees, additional coverage is provided for all medical expenses for life.

In Japan, participant salary and future salary increases are not factors in determining pension benefit cost or the related pension benefit obligation.
We base our assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets on historical trends (10-year historical rates of return for the Japanese plan assets and 15-year historical rates of return for the U.S. plan assets), expected future market movement, as well as the portfolio mix of securities in the asset portfolio including, but not limited to, style, class and equity and fixed income allocations. In addition, our consulting actuaries evaluate our assumptions for long-term rates of return under Actuarial Standards of Practice (ASOP). Under the ASOP, the actual portfolio type, mix and class is modeled to determine a range of long-term rates of return. We in turn use those results to further validate our own assumptions.
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point increase and decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects as of December31, 2011: (In millions) One percentage point increase Increase in total service and interest costs $ 2 Increase in postretirement benefit obligation 12 One percentage point decrease Decrease in total service and interest costs $ 1 Decrease in postretirement benefit obligation 10 138 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost Net periodic (benefit) cost, included in acquisition and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended December31, included the following components: Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits Japan U.S.

No prior service costs or credits or transition obligations arose during 2011, and the amounts of prior service costs and credits and transition obligations amortized to expense were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Amortization of actuarial losses to expense in 2012 is estimated to be $3 million for the Japanese plans, $9 million for the U.S. plans and $1 million for the other postretirement benefits plan, while the amortization of prior service costs and credits and transition obligations are expected to be negligible.

The funding policy for our non-qualified supplemental defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits plan is to contribute the amount of the benefit payments made during the year.
139 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Plan Assets The investment objective of our Japanese and U.S. funded defined benefit plans is to preserve the purchasing power of the plans assets and earn a reasonable inflation-adjusted rate of return over the long term. Furthermore, we seek to accomplish these objectives in a manner that allows for the adequate funding of plan benefits and expenses. In order to achieve these objectives, our goal is to maintain a conservative, well-diversified and balanced portfolio of high-quality equity, fixed-income and money market securities. As a part of our strategy, we have established strict policies covering quality, type and concentration of investment securities. For our Japanese plan, these policies include limitations on investments in derivatives including futures, options and swaps, and low-liquidity investments such as real estate, venture capital investments, and privately issued securities. For our U.S. plan, these policies prohibit investments in precious metals, limited partnerships, venture capital, and direct investments in real estate. We are also prohibited from trading on margin.
The plan fiduciaries for our funded defined benefit plans have developed guidelines for asset allocations reflecting a percentage of total assets by asset class, which are reviewed on an annual basis. Asset allocation targets as of December31, 2011 were as follows: Japan Pension U.S.

401(k) Plan The Company sponsors a 401(k) plan in which we match a portion of employees contributions. The plan provides for salary reduction contributions by employees and, in 2011, 2010, and 2009, provided matching contributions by the Company of 50% of each employees contributions which were not in excess of 6% of the employees annual cash compensation. The matching contributions by the Company, included in acquisition and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings, were $4 million in each of the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The plan trustee held approximately 2million shares of our common stock for plan participants at December31, 2011.
Stock Bonus Plan Aflac U.S. maintains a stock bonus plan for eligible U.S. sales associates. Plan participants receive shares of Aflac Incorporated common stock based on their new annualized premium sales and their first-year persistency of substantially all new insurance policies. The cost of this plan, which was capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs, amounted to $35 million in 2011, $34 million in 2010 and $40 million in 2009.
14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES We have three outsourcing agreements with IBM. The first agreement provides mainframe computer operations and support for Aflac Japan. It has a remaining term of 4 years and an aggregate remaining cost of 16.2 billion yen ($209 million using the December31, 2011, exchange rate). The second agreement provides distributed computer mid-range server operations and support for Aflac Japan. It has a remaining term of 4 years and an aggregate remaining cost of 14.4 billion yen ($185 million using the December31, 2011, exchange rate). The third agreement provides application maintenance and development services for Aflac Japan. It has a remaining term of 6 years and an aggregate remaining cost of 10.4 billion yen ($134 million using the December31, 2011, exchange rate).
We have an outsourcing agreement with Accenture to provide application maintenance and development services for our Japanese operation. The agreement with Accenture has a remaining term of 6 years with an aggregate remaining cost of 7.5 billion yen ($96 million using the December31, 2011, exchange rate).
We have an outsourcing agreement with NTTDATA to provide application maintenance and development services for our Japanese operation. The agreement with NTTDATA has a remaining term of 2 years with an aggregate remaining cost of .6 billion yen ($8 million using the December31, 2011, exchange rate).
We lease office space and equipment under agreements that expire in various years through 2020.

Members of our senior legal and financial management teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. The final results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. Although some of this litigation is pending in states where large 141 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements punitive damages, bearing little relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs, have been awarded in recent years, we believe the outcome of pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In February 2012, the Parent Company issued two series of senior notes totaling $750 million through a U.S. public debt offering. The first series, which totaled $400 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.65% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a five-year maturity. The second series, which totaled $350 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.00% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a ten-year maturity. We have entered into cross-currency swaps to minimize the impact of foreign currency translation on shareholders equity and to reduce interest expense by converting the dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes we issued into yen-denominated obligations.

150 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (c) FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Aflac Incorporated: Under date of February24, 2012, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December31, 2011, and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income (loss) for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011, which are included herein. In connection with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also audited the related consolidated financial statement schedules as listed in Item15. These financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statement schedules based on our audits.
In our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of evaluating consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) and qualified special purpose entities (QSPEs) due to the adoption of new accounting requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), effective January1, 2010. Also as discussed in Note 1, the Company changed its method of evaluating other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities due to the adoption of new accounting requirements issued by the FASB, effective January1, 2009.

155 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements SCHEDULE II CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT Aflac Incorporated (Parent Only) Notes to Condensed Financial Statements The accompanying condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Aflac Incorporated and Subsidiaries included in PartII, Item8 of this report.
(A)Notes Payable A summary of notes payable as of December31 follows: (In millions) 2011 2010 8.50% senior notes due May 2019 $ 850 $ 850 6.45% senior notes due August 2040 448 (1) 448 (1) 6.90% senior notes due December 2039 396 (2) 396 (2) 3.45% senior notes due August 2015 300 300 Yen-denominated Uridashi notes: 1.52% notes paid September 2011 (principal amount 15 billion yen) 0 184 2.26% notes due September 2016 (principal amount 10 billion yen) 129 123 Variable interest rate notes paid September 2011 (.66% at December 2010, principal amount 20 billion yen) 0 245 Yen-denominated Samurai notes: 1.47% notes due July 2014 (principal amount 28.7 billion yen) 369 0 1.87% notes due June 2012 (principal amount 30 billion yen) 386 368 1.84% notes due July 2016 (principal amount 15.8 billion yen) 203 0 Variable interest rate notes due July 2014 (1.34% at December 2011, principal amount 5.5 billion yen) 71 0 Yen-denominated loans: 3.60% loan due July 2015 (principal amount 10 billion yen) 129 123 3.00% loan due August 2015 (principal amount 5 billion yen) 64 61 Total notes payable $ 3,345 $ 3,098 (1) $450 issuance net of a $2 underwriting discount that is being amortized over the life of the notes (2) $400 issuance net of a $4 underwriting discount that is being amortized over the life of the notes During 2009, Aflac Japan bought on the open market 5.4 billion yen of yen-denominated Uridashi and Samurai notes issued by the Parent Company which are outstanding as of December31, 2011. In consolidation, those notes have been extinguished; however, they remain an outstanding liability for the Parent Company until their maturity date.
The aggregate contractual maturities of notes payable during each of the years after December31, 2011, are as follows: (In millions) 2012 $ 386 2013 0 2014 440 2015 493 2016 332 Thereafter 1,700 Total $ 3,351 In February 2012, the Parent Company issued two series of senior notes totaling $750 million through a U.S. public debt offering. The first series, which totaled $400 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.65% per annum, 156 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements payable semi-annually, and has a five-year maturity. The second series, which totaled $350 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.00% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a ten-year maturity.
For further information regarding notes payable, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(B)Derivatives We do not use derivatives for trading purposes, nor do we engage in leveraged derivative transactions. At December31, 2011, the Parent Companys only outstanding freestanding derivative contract was an interest rate swap related to its 5.5 billion yen variable interest rate Samurai notes. For further information regarding this derivative, see Notes 1, 4 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have entered into cross-currency swaps on the $750 million of senior notes issued in February 2012 to minimize the impact of foreign currency translation on shareholders equity and to reduce interest expense by converting the dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes we issued into yen-denominated obligations. By entering into these cross-currency swaps, we converted the first series $400 million liability into a 30.9billion yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from 2.65% in dollars to 1.22% in yen, and we converted the second series $350 million liability into a 27.0billion yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from 4.00% in dollars to 2.07% in yen.
From time to time, we purchase certain investments that contain an embedded derivative. We assess whether this embedded derivative is clearly and closely related to the asset that serves as its host contract. If we deem that the embedded derivatives terms are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the derivative is separated from that contract, held at fair value and reported with the host instrument in the consolidated balance sheet, with changes in fair value reported in earnings.
(C)Income Taxes The Parent Company and its eligible U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Income tax liabilities or benefits are recorded by each principal subsidiary based upon separate return calculations, and any difference between the consolidated provision and the aggregate amounts recorded by the subsidiaries is reflected in the Parent Company financial statements. For further information on income taxes, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(D)Dividend Restrictions See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding dividend restrictions.
