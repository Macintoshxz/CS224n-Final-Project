Aflac Incorporated qualifies as a large accelerated filer within the meaning of Exchange Act Rule12b-2. Our Internet address is aflac.com. The information on the Companys Web site is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form10-K. We make available, free of charge on our Web site, our annual report on Form10-K, quarterly reports on Form10-Q, current reports on Form8-K and amendments thereto as soon as reasonably practicable after those forms have been electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
General Description Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) was incorporated in 1973 under the laws of the state of Georgia. Aflac Incorporated is a general business holding company and acts as a management company, overseeing the operations of its subsidiaries by providing management services and making capital available. Its principal business is supplemental health and life insurance, which is marketed and administered through its subsidiary, American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflacs policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business.
We believe Aflac is the worlds leading writer of individually issued policies marketed at worksites. We continue to diversify our product offerings in both Japan and the United States. Aflac Japan sells cancer plans, care plans, general medical indemnity plans, medical/sickness riders, living benefit life plans, ordinary life insurance plans and annuities. Aflac U.S. sells cancer plans and various types of health insurance, including accident/disability, fixed-benefit dental, sickness and hospital indemnity, vision care, hospital intensive care, long-term care, ordinary life, and short-term disability plans.
We are authorized to conduct insurance business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, several U.S. territories and Japan. Aflac Japan accounted for 72% of the Companys total revenues in 2006, 74% in 2005 and 75% in 2004. The percentage of total assets attributable to Aflac Japan was 82% at both December31, 2006 and 2005. For additional information see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Insurance Products - Japan Aflac Japans insurance products are designed to help consumers pay for medical and nonmedical costs that are not reimbursed under Japans national health insurance system. Changes in Japans economy and an aging population have put increasing pressure on Japans national health care system. As a result, more costs are being shifted to Japanese consumers, who in turn have become increasingly interested in insurance products that help them manage those costs. Aflac Japan has responded to this consumer need by enhancing existing products and developing new products.
Aflac Japans stand-alone medical product, EVER, offers a basic level of hospitalization coverage with an affordable premium. We introduced two new versions of EVER in early 2005: EVER Half and EVER Bonus. EVER Half is a whole-life medical policy with benefits similar to the original EVER product. With EVER Half, premiums are cut in half when the policyholder reaches age 60 or 65. EVER Bonus has all of the same features of EVER Half, but also provides a bonus payment every 10years unless the hospitalization benefit was paid for 10 or more consecutive days. In addition, EVER Bonus provides a death benefit and a cash surrender value. We continue to believe that the medical category will be an important part of our product portfolio.
The cancer life insurance plans we offer in Japan provide a lump-sum benefit upon initial diagnosis of internal cancer and a fixed daily benefit for hospitalization and outpatient services related to cancer as well as surgical, convalescent and terminal care benefits. These plans differ from Aflac U.S. cancer plans in that the Japanese policies may also provide death benefits and cash surrender values. In 2006, we designed a new cancer product for distribution by Dai-ichi Life that is customized for their market. In 2005, we introduced a new cancer insurance product that incorporates a wellness benefit, while also increasing the daily outpatient benefit to the same level as the hospitalization I- 3 Table of Contents benefit. Our Rider MAX product provides accident and medical/sickness benefits as a rider to our cancer life policy.
The life products that we offer in Japan provide death benefits and cash surrender values. These products are available as stand-alone policies and riders. We introduced a new product called WAYS in early 2006. WAYS is a life insurance policy that allows policyholders to convert a portion of their life insurance to medical, nursing care, or fixed annuity benefits at a predetermined age.
We also offer traditional fixed-income annuities and care policies. For additional information on Aflac Japans products and composition of sales, see the Aflac Japan section of MD&A in this report.
Insurance Products - U.S.
We design our U.S. insurance products to provide supplemental coverage for people who already have major medical or primary insurance coverage. The policies are portable and pay regardless of other insurance. Our health insurance plans are guaranteed-renewable for the lifetime of the policyholder (to age 70 for short-term disability policies). We cannot cancel guaranteed-renewable coverage, but we can increase premium rates on existing policies on a uniform, nondiscriminatory basis by class of policy in response to adverse experience. Any premium rate increases are subject to state regulatory approval. We have had minimal rate increase activity in the last five years.
Aflac U.S. offers an accident and disability policy to protect against losses resulting from accidents. The accident portion of the policy includes lump-sum benefits for accidental death, dismemberment, and specific injuries as well as fixed benefits for hospital confinement. Optional disability riders are also available. Short-term disability policies provide disability benefits with a variety of elimination and benefit period options. The longest such benefit period offered is two years.
Our U.S. cancer plans are designed to provide insurance benefits for medical and nonmedical costs that are not covered by major medical insurance. Benefits include a first-occurrence benefit that pays an initial amount when internal cancer is first diagnosed; a fixed amount for each day an insured is hospitalized for cancer treatment; fixed amounts for radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery; and a wellness benefit applicable toward certain diagnostic tests.
Our hospital indemnity products provide fixed daily benefits for hospitalization due to accident or sickness. In 2005, we introduced a new version of our hospital indemnity plan. Indemnity benefits for inpatient and outpatient surgeries, as well as various other diagnostic expenses, are also available. Our sickness indemnity plan provides a fixed daily benefit for hospitalization due to sickness and fixed amounts for physician services for accident or sickness.
In July2006, we introduced a revised specified health event policy that gives consumers three benefit and premium levels from which they may select. One of the levels combines the new specified health event policy with our intensive care plan. By leveraging administrative efficiencies, consumers can purchase the combined coverage for less money than if they had purchased the policies separately.
I- 4 Table of Contents Aflac U.S. offers term and whole-life policies sold through payroll deduction at the worksite and various term and whole-life policies on a direct basis. In early 2006, we introduced a revised life insurance portfolio called the Life Protector Series. This product line offers term policies with varying duration options and a new whole-life policy with additional benefits, including an increased face value option. These revisions greatly enhanced the product category and contributed to its success in the marketplace.
We also offer a series of fixed-benefit dental policies, providing various levels of benefits for dental procedures, including checkups and cleanings. Plan features include a renewal guarantee, no deductible and no network restrictions.
In 2005, we introduced Vision Now SM , which provides benefits for serious eye health conditions and loss of sight. Vision Now includes coverage for corrective eye materials and exam benefits.
We also offer other health insurance products including tax qualified and non-qualified long-term care plans. For additional information on Aflacs U.S. products and composition of sales, see the Aflac U.S. section of MD&A in this report.
Distribution - Japan We sell our products primarily through two distribution channels: independent/individual agencies and affiliated corporate agencies.
The individual agencies and independent corporate agencies that sell our products give us better access to workers at the vast number of small businesses in Japan. Agents activities are primarily focused on insurance sales, with customer service support provided by the Aflac Contact Center. Individual agencies contributed 58% of total new annualized premium sales in 2006, and 57% in both 2005 and 2004.
Affiliated corporate agencies are formed when companies establish subsidiary businesses to sell our insurance products to their employees, suppliers and customers. These agencies help us reach employees at large worksites, including 90% of the companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Reflecting changed employment patterns and consumers desire for consultation, Aflacs sales growth through large affiliated corporate agencies has slowed for several years. However, we still consider the corporate channel to be an important part of our distribution system and believe it is a valuable means for reaching workers at large employers. To rejuvenate this channel, we are encouraging our affiliated agencies to move away from passive, or pull sales tactics, like direct mailings and newspaper ads, and instead adopt active, or push techniques that involve more follow-up calls and face-to-face sales consultations. We are also working to have some of our larger affiliated agencies form alliances with individual agencies who already have expertise in a face-to-face sales approach. Affiliated corporate agencies contributed 33% of total new annualized premium sales in 2006, compared with 35% in 2005 and 36% in 2004.
To improve the overall effectiveness of our sales force, we started a new training initiative. This new program uses six months of classroom training and practical field training to equip sales I- 5 Table of Contents associates with the skills necessary for their success. By the end of 2006, we had trained more than 700 of Aflac Japans field employees, who in turn, are now positioned to train primarily newly recruited sales associates.
Aflac Service Shops, which are primarily owned and operated by individual sales agencies, are gaining in popularity as many consumers in Japan seek one-on-one consultation and convenience in handling their insurance needs. By the end of 2006, we had 570 Aflac Service Shops throughout Japan.
As of December31, 2006, there were approximately 18,400 agencies in Japan with more than 90,000 licensed agents, compared with approximately 17,960 agencies and 81,700 licensed agents a year ago. We believe that new agencies will continue to be attracted to Aflac Japans high commissions, superior products, customer service and brand image.
We also continued to reach consumers through our strategic marketing alliance with Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance Company (Dai-ichi Life). We believe our alliance has been one of the most successful partnerships in the insurance industry. In 2006, Dai-ichi Life sold 269,700 of our market leading cancer life policies, compared with 277,700 policies in 2005 and 244,400 policies in 2004, leading Dai-ichi to retain its distinction as the number two seller of cancer insurance behind only Aflac Japan.
We expect that our distribution system will continue to evolve in Japan. Regulatory changes that are scheduled to take effect on December31, 2007 will enable banks to sell our products to their customers. Although there will undoubtedly be a lot of competition for the bank distribution channel, we have established long-term relationships with many banks throughout Japan, and we are excited about the opportunity to grow our business through this channel beginning in 2008.
For additional information on Aflac Japans distribution, see the Aflac Japan section of MD&A in this report.
Distribution - U.S.
Our U.S. sales force comprises sales associates who are independent contractors licensed to sell accident and health insurance. Many are also licensed to sell life insurance. Associates are paid personal production commissions based on first-year and renewal premiums from their sales of insurance products. In addition to receiving commissions on personal production, associates who serve as district, regional and state sales coordinators may also receive override commissions and incentive bonuses. Most associates efforts are principally focused on selling supplemental insurance at the worksite. Administrative personnel in Georgia, New York, and Nebraska handle policyholder service functions, including issuance of policies, premium collection, payment notices and claims.
I- 6 Table of Contents We concentrate on marketing our products at the worksite. This method offers policies to individuals through common media such as employment, trade and other associations. This manner of marketing is distinct from the group insurance sales approach, as our primary method of enrollment results from the individual insured being directly contacted by the sales associate. Policies are individually underwritten, with premiums generally paid by the employee. Additionally, Aflac policies are portable, meaning that individuals may retain their full insurance coverage upon separation from employment or such affiliation, generally at the same premium. We collect a major portion of premiums on such sales through payroll deduction or other forms of centralized billing. Worksite marketing enables a sales associate to reach a greater number of prospective policyholders and lowers distribution costs, compared with individually marketed business.
During 2004 and 2005, we took several steps to enhance our distribution system. We concentrated on expanding our sales management infrastructure and training and recruiting initiatives. In 2006, we continued our focus on recruiting and training as a means for growing our producer base. During 2006, recruiting was up 7.8% to approximately 26,100 new sales associates, compared with 2005. The total number of licensed agents was 8.5% higher at December31, 2006, compared with year-end 2005.
The goal of our recruiting and training focus has been to increase the number of sales associates producing business on a weekly basis. We believe that we can achieve better producer growth through more effective and standardized training for our sales associates and sales management. As previously disclosed, we shifted our focus during 2006 from average monthly producers to average weekly producers as both a reporting and management metric. This shift enables active management of our sales associates and allows our sales management to monitor progress and needs on a real-time basis. On a weekly basis, the average number of U.S. associates actively producing business during 2006 was 10,300, compared with 9,700 in both 2005 and 2004.
For new sales associates, we continued to implement LEASE training, which stands for Larger Earnings by Acquiring Smaller Employers. In 2006, we merged LEASE with the New Associate Training Cycle, combining classroom instruction, e-learning through Aflac University  and field training. We believe that combining LEASE into the New Associate Training Cycle will help get new sales associates off to a quick start.
In addition, associates that exhibit leadership skills are invited to participate in our national Coordinator in Training (CIT) program, which we introduced nationwide in July2005. The goal of the CIT program is to build a pool of well-trained candidates for the district sales coordinator (DSC) position, which is the first level of Aflac sales management. As such, the CIT program concentrates on developing their skills so that they have a better chance to succeed as a DSC and beyond.
And finally, we introduced an enhanced regional coordinator accreditation program (RCAP) in 2006. This program was designed for both new and experienced regional sales coordinators (RSCs). In early 2006, we began bringing current RSCs to Aflac Worldwide Headquarters for five days of intense and interactive workshops in areas such as recruiting, leadership, planning, team building, and technology.

Competition - Japan In 1974, Aflac became the second non-Japanese life insurance company to gain direct access to the Japanese insurance market by obtaining an operating license. Through 1981, we faced limited competition for cancer life insurance policy sales. However, Japan has experienced two periods of deregulation since we entered the market. The first came in the early 1980s, when nine mid-sized insurers, including domestic and foreign, were allowed to sell cancer insurance products for the first time. In 2001, all life and non-life insurers were allowed to sell stand-alone cancer and medical insurance products as well as other stand-alone health insurance products. As a result, the number of insurance companies offering stand-alone cancer and medical insurance has more than doubled in the five years since full deregulation. However, based on our growth of annualized premiums in force and agencies, we do not believe that our market leading position has been significantly impacted by increased competition as a result of deregulation. Furthermore, we believe the continued development and maintenance of operating efficiencies will allow us to offer affordable products that appeal to consumers.
Aflac has had substantial success selling cancer life policies in Japan, with 14 million cancer life policies in force as of December31, 2006. We believe we will remain a leading provider of cancer life insurance coverage in Japan, principally due to our experience in the market, low-cost operations, unique marketing system (see Distribution - Japan above) and product expertise.
We have also experienced substantial success selling medical insurance in Japan. While other companies have recognized the opportunities that we have seen in the medical insurance market and offered new products, we believe our products stand out as a tremendous value to consumers. Aflac Japan continued to be the number one seller of stand-alone medical insurance in the life insurance industry in terms of policy sales throughout the year.
Competition - U.S.
Approximately 2,000 life insurance companies are licensed in the United States. We compete against several insurers on a national basis plus other insurers regionally. We believe our policies and premium rates, as well as the commissions paid to our sales agents, are competitive with those offered by other companies providing similar types of insurance. However, we believe our U.S. business is distinct from our competitors because of our product focus, distribution system, and brand awareness. For many of the other companies that sell supplemental insurance, it represents a secondary business. For us, it is our primary business. We also believe that our growing distribution system of independent sales associates expands our business opportunities, while our advertising campaigns have increased our name awareness and the effectiveness of our branding efforts.
Private insurers and voluntary and cooperative plans, such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield, provide insurance for hospitalization and medical expenses. Much of this insurance is sold on a group basis. The federal and state governments also pay substantial costs of medical treatment through various I- 8 Table of Contents programs. Such major medical insurance generally covers a substantial amount of the medical expenses incurred by an insured as a result of accident and disability, cancer or other major illnesses. Aflacs policies are designed to provide coverage that supplements major medical insurance and may also be used to defray nonmedical expenses. Thus, we do not compete directly with major medical insurers. However, the scope of major medical coverage offered by other insurers does represent a potential limitation on the market for our products. Accordingly, expansion of coverage by other insurers or governmental programs could adversely affect our business opportunities. Conversely, any reduction of coverage, or increased deductibles and copayments, by other insurers or governmental programs could favorably affect our business opportunities.
Investments and Investment Results Net investment income was $2.2 billion in 2006, $2.1 billion in 2005, and $2.0 billion in 2004. Growth of net investment income during the last three years has been impacted by low available investment yields for new money in both Japan and the United States. In particular, Japans life insurance industry has contended with low investment yields for a number of years. Although the Bank of Japan ended its zero-interest-rate policy in 2006, market yields on long-duration fixed maturity securities, which we primarily purchase, did not increase significantly during the year.

Regulation - Japan The financial and business affairs of Aflac Japan are subject to examination by Japans Financial Services Agency (FSA). Aflac Japan files annual reports and financial statements for the Japanese insurance operations based on a March31 fiscal year end, prepared in accordance with Japanese regulatory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the FSA. Japanese regulatory basis earnings are determined using accounting principles that differ materially from U.S. GAAP. Under Japanese regulatory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are charged off immediately; deferred income tax liabilities are recognized on a different basis; policy benefit and claim reserving methods and assumptions are different; the carrying value of securities transferred to held to maturity is different; policyholder protection fund obligations are not accrued; and premium income is recognized I- 12 Table of Contents on a cash basis. Reconciliations of the net assets of the Japan branch on a U.S. GAAP basis to net assets determined on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis as of December31 were as follows: (Inmillions) 2006 2005 Aflac Japan net assets on GAAP basis $ 5,740 $ 5,472 Elimination of deferred policy acquisition   costs (3,857 ) (3,624 ) Adjustment to income tax liabilities 1,746 1,501 Adjustment to policy liabilities (239 ) 139 Adjustment of unrealized gains and other   adjustments to carrying value of debt securities (532 ) (518 ) Elimination of policyholder protection fund   liability 175 203 Reduction in premiums receivable (91 ) (96 ) Other, net (331 ) (290 ) Aflac   Japan net assets on Japanese regulatory accounting basis $ 2,611 $ 2,787 The FSA maintains a solvency standard, which is used by Japanese regulators to monitor the financial strength of insurance companies. Aflac Japans solvency margin continues to significantly exceed regulatory minimums. A portion of Aflac Japans annual earnings, as determined on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis, may be repatriated each year to Aflac U.S. after complying with solvency margin provisions and satisfying various conditions imposed by Japans regulatory authorities for protecting policyholders. These repatriated profits represent a portion of Aflac Japans after-tax earnings reported to the FSA on a March31 fiscal year basis. If needed, we may elect not to repatriate profits to Aflac U.S. or to repatriate a reduced amount to strengthen Aflac Japans solvency margin. In addition, the FSA may not allow profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to Aflac U.S. if they would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of Japanese policyholders. We do not expect these requirements to adversely affect the funds available for profit repatriations. Nor do we expect these requirements to adversely affect the funds available for payments of allocated expenses to Aflac U.S. and management fees to the Parent Company.
As disclosed in our third quarter 2006 Form10-Q, Aflac Japan, along with the entire life insurance industry, began a review of the last five years of paid claims to determine if those claims were paid fully and accurately. In a recent notification from the FSA, the review process has been changed from a voluntary program to one that is mandatory and has been expanded to include a review of cash surrender value payments. Additionally, the FSA established a reporting deadline of April 13, 2007. We expect to complete our review of claims and cash surrender value payments and report our findings to the FSA within the time frame specified. As a result of this review, we have found some payment errors and we are correcting them. Additionally, we are using this review to identify process changes that will help ensure that payment errors such as these are not repeated. Although immaterial to our financial statements, we have provided for our estimate of the underpaid portion of those claims in our unpaid policy claims liability as of December31, 2006.
I- 13 Table of Contents The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection fund that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. For additional information regarding the policyholder protection fund, see the Policyholder Protection Fund section of MD&A and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.
In October2005, legislation aimed at privatizing Japans postal system (Japan Post) was enacted into law. Prior to the move to privatize, Japan Post enjoyed significant advantages over the private sector, which in turn made competing against it difficult for the private sector. The privatization laws split Japan Post into four independent entities and generally recognize the need for a level playing field between Japan Post and the private sector. Specifically, the laws contain a commitment to implement measures to ensure equivalent conditions of competition between the four privatized Japan Post companies and other companies engaged in like business operations. The laws also require the postal insurance entity of Japan Post to ultimately be subject to the same tax and policyholder safety-net contribution requirements as its private industry competitors. In addition, the insurance entity would also be subject to Insurance Business Law and FSA supervision. The privatization process is scheduled to be completed by October2017.
In July2006, Japan Post submitted an outline of its privatization plan to the government. When the new Japan Post financial entities start operations on October1, 2007, they will be limited to the products that they now currently offer. Japan Post is scheduled to submit a full version of its privatization plan to the government in April2007. Various government entities will then review the plan. This review should be completed by the end of July2007. After October2007, any new business proposals would, in addition to the normal FSA approval process, have to undergo a special review by Japans Postal Privatization Committee and approval by Japans Prime Minister and the Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications.
Our branch in Japan is also subject to regulation and supervision in the United States (see Regulation - U.S.). For additional information regarding Aflac Japans operations and regulations, see the Aflac Japan section of MD&A and Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.
Regulation - U.S.
The Parent Company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to state regulations in the United States as an insurance holding company system. Such regulations generally provide that transactions between companies within the holding company system must be fair and equitable. In addition, transfers of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries, and material transactions between companies within the system are subject to prior notice to, or approval by, state regulatory authorities.
I- 14 Table of Contents Like all U.S. insurance companies, Aflac is subject to regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business. In general, the insurance laws of the various jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to, among other things:  granting and revoking licenses to transact business  regulating trade practices  licensing of agents  approval of policy forms and premium rates  standards of solvency and maintenance of specified policy benefit reserves and minimum loss ratio requirements  capital requirements  limitations on dividends to shareholders  the nature of and limitations on investments  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  filing of financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory insurance accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities  periodic examinations of the market conduct, financial, and other affairs of insurance companies Additionally, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is constantly reviewing regulatory matters and recommending changes and revisions for adoption by state legislators and insurance departments.
The NAIC uses a risk-based capital formula relating to insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk to facilitate identification by insurance regulators of inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurers operations. The formulas for determining the amount of risk-based capital specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the Companys regulatory total adjusted capital to its authorized control level risk-based capital as defined by the NAIC. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The levels are Company action, regulatory action, authorized control, and mandatory control. Aflacs NAIC risk-based capital ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and surplus position.

ITEM1A.
RISK FACTORS.
Risk Factors We face a wide range of risks, and our continued success depends on our ability to identify, prioritize and appropriately manage our enterprise risk exposures. Readers should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Form10-K. These risks and other factors may affect forward-looking statements, including those in this document or made by the Company elsewhere, such as in earnings release webcasts, investor conference presentations or press releases. The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, it could have a material impact on the Company.
We operate in an industry that is subject to ongoing changes.
We operate in a competitive environment and in an industry that is subject to ongoing changes from market pressures brought about by customer demands, legislative reform and marketing practices. These factors require us to anticipate market trends and make changes to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors. We also face the potential of competition from existing or new companies that have not historically been in the supplemental health insurance industry. Failure to anticipate market trends and/or to differentiate our products and services can affect our ability to retain or grow profitable lines of business.
Our concentration of business in Japan poses risks to our operations.
Our operations in Japan accounted for 72%, 74%, and 75% of our total revenues for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and 82% of our total assets at both December31, 2006 and 2005. As a result, weakness in Japans economy could adversely affect our business. The weak economy in Japan that emerged in the early 1990s resulted in a challenging marketing environment for Aflac Japan, with declining available investment yields for new investments and decreased consumer confidence. Although the Japanese economy has shown signs of improvement from time to time, the time required for a full recovery remains uncertain.
I- 18 Table of Contents Japanese currency translation risk could adversely impact operating results.
Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported financial position and results of operations. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported.
Aflac Japans premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we primarily purchase yen-denominated assets to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen-denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not an economic event to our Company or shareholders.
General market conditions affect investments and investment income.
We have substantial investment portfolios that support our policy liabilities. Low levels of interest rates on investments, such as those experienced in the United States and Japan during recent years, have negatively impacted the level of investment income earned by the Company. Slower investment income growth will occur if a low-interest-rate environment persists.
Financial market conditions can also affect our realized and unrealized investment gains or losses. During periods of rising interest rates, the fair values of our investments will decline. Conversely, during periods of falling interest rates, the fair values of our investments will rise. However, should significant amounts of unrealized gains/losses occur because of changes in market yields, we would not expect to realize significant gains or losses due to our ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity or recovery of value.
Availability of acceptable yen-denominated investments could adversely affect our profits.
We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. At December31, 2006, the average duration of Aflac Japans policy liabilities and its yen-denominated debt securities was approximately 13 years. When our debt securities mature, there is a risk that the proceeds will be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy liabilities. If this occurs, Aflac Japans business would be adversely affected.
Concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular sector of the economy may have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
The concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and, consequently, on our results of operations and financial position. Events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic sector may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified.
I- 19 Table of Contents If future policy benefits, claims or expenses exceed those anticipated in establishing premiums and reserves, our financial results would be adversely affected.
We establish and carry, as a liability, reserves based on estimates of how much will be required to pay for future benefits and claims. We calculate these reserves using various assumptions and estimates, including premiums we will receive over the assumed life of the policy; the timing, frequency and severity of the events covered by the insurance policy; and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with a portion of our net cash flow from operations. These assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or claims. If our actual experience is different from our assumptions or estimates, our reserves may prove inadequate. As a result, we would incur a charge to earnings in the period in which we determine such a shortfall exists. This estimation process is a critical accounting policy for the Company.
Our operating subsidiaries provide cash flow to the Parent Company.
Aflac Incorporated is a holding company and has no direct operations or no significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations. There is no assurance that the earnings from, or other available assets of, our operating subsidiaries will be sufficient to make distributions to us to enable us to operate.
Extensive regulation can impact profitability and growth.
Aflacs insurance subsidiaries are subject to complex laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, the SEC, the NAIC, the FSA, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in Japan, the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and the Internal Revenue Service, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal or regulatory issue may not result in compliance with another regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. There is also a risk that any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal or regulatory issue may change over time to our detriment. In addition, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business.
I- 20 Table of Contents The primary purpose of insurance company regulation supervision is the protection of insurance policyholders, rather than investors. The extent of regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes in the United States and by the FSA and the MOF in Japan. These systems of supervision and regulation cover, among other things:  standards of establishing and setting premium rates and the approval thereof  standards of minimum capital requirements and solvency margins, including risk-based capital measures  restrictions on, limitations on and required approval of certain transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates, including management fee arrangements  restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our primary insurance operations  limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay or foreign profits that can be repatriated  the existence and licensing status of the Company under circumstances where it is not writing new or renewal business  certain required methods of accounting  reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes  assignment of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies  administrative practices requirements  imposition of fines and other sanctions Sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract, retain and support a network of qualified sales associates.
Our sales could be adversely affected if our sales networks deteriorate or if we do not adequately provide support, training and education for our existing network. Competition exists for sales associates with demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurers and financial institutions primarily on the basis of our products, compensation, support services and financial rating. An inability to attract and retain qualified sales associates could have a material adverse effect on sales and our results of operations and financial condition. Our sales associates are independent contractors and may sell products of our competitors. If our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours, or pay higher commissions than we do, these sales associates may concentrate their efforts on selling our competitors products instead of ours.
I- 21 Table of Contents Success of our business depends in part on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology; certain significant multi-year strategic information technology projects are currently in process.
Our business depends in large part on our technology systems for interacting with employers, policyholders and sales associates, and our business strategy involves providing customers with easy-to-use products to meet their needs. Some of our information technology systems and software are older, legacy-type systems that are less efficient and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards (including adequate business continuity procedures). We are currently developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and customer demands. Our success is dependent in large part on maintaining or improving the effectiveness of existing systems and continuing to develop and enhance information systems that support our business processes in a cost-efficient manner.
Changes in accounting standards issued by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.
Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in both the United States and Japan, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition.
Any decrease in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position.
Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance companys business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurers ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurers statutory capital; a change in a rating agencys determination of the amount of risk-adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating; an increase in the perceived risk of an insurers investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in management; or other considerations that may or may not be under the insurers control. Because all of our ratings are subject to continuous review, the retention of these ratings cannot be assured. A multi-level downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on agent recruiting and retention, sales, competitiveness, and the marketability of our products impacting our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.
I- 22 Table of Contents We face risks related to litigation.
We are a defendant in various lawsuits considered to be in the normal course of business. Senior legal and financial management review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. The final results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. Although some of this litigation is pending in states where large punitive damages bearing little relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs have been awarded in recent years, we believe the outcome of pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, costs of settlement or judgments against us or because of changes in our operations that could result from litigation.
Managing key executive succession is critical to our success.
We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for succession of our senior management and other key executives. While we have succession plans and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will be available to us.
We also face other risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, which include:  any requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles  failure of our processes to prevent and detect unethical conduct of employees  a significant failure of internal controls over financial reporting  failure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal policies and regulatory requirements  failure of corporate governance policies and procedures I- 23 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those informational statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements. We desire to take advantage of these provisions. This report contains cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected herein, and in any other statements made by Company officials in communications with the financial community and contained in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Forward-looking statements are not based on historical information and relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Furthermore, forward-looking information is subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. In particular, statements containing words such as expect, anticipate, believe, goal, objective, may, should, estimate, intends, projects, will, assumes, potential, target, or similar words as well as specific projections of future results, generally qualify as forward-looking. Aflac undertakes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements.
We caution readers that the following factors, in addition to other factors mentioned from time to time, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements:  legislative and regulatory developments  assessments for insurance company insolvencies  competitive conditions in the United States and Japan  new product development and customer response to new products and new marketing initiatives  ability to attract and retain qualified sales associates and employees  ability to repatriate profits from Japan  changes in U.S. and/or Japanese tax laws or accounting requirements  credit and other risks associated with Aflacs investment activities  significant changes in investment yield rates  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  deviations in actual experience from pricing and reserving assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity, mortality, persistency, expenses, and investment yields  level and outcome of litigation  downgrades in the Companys credit rating  changes in rating agency policies or practices  subsidiarys ability to pay dividends to the Parent Company  ineffectiveness of hedging strategies  catastrophic events  general economic conditions in the United States and Japan II- 5 Table of Contents COMPANY OVERVIEW Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (the Company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The Companys insurance business is marketed and administered through American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflacs policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of Aflac Incorporated and its subsidiaries for the three-year period ended December31, 2006. As a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements and notes.
This MD&A is divided into four primary sections. In the first section, we discuss our critical accounting estimates. We then follow with a discussion of the results of our operations on a consolidated basis and by segment. The third section presents an analysis of our financial condition as well as a discussion of market risks of financial instruments. We conclude by addressing the availability of capital and the sources and uses of cash in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. The estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of Aflacs results of operations and financial condition are those related to investments, deferred policy acquisition costs and policy liabilities. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from managements analyses and judgments. The application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 95% of our assets and 84% of our liabilities are reported and thus have a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders equity. Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results.
Investments Aflacs investments in debt and equity securities include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. For privately issued securities, we receive pricing data from external sources that take into account each securitys credit quality and liquidity characteristics. We also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary. These reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.59, Accounting for Non-Current Marketable Equity Securities; Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.115, II- 6 Table of Contents Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities; Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments and related guidance. The identification of distressed investments, the determination of fair value if not publicly traded, and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment and require evaluation of factors, including but not limited to:  percentage decline in value and the length of time during which the decline has occurred  recoverability of principal and interest  market conditions  ability to hold the investment to maturity  review of the issuers overall operating performance  rating agency opinions and actions regarding the issuers credit standing  adverse changes in the issuers availability of production resources, revenue sources and technological conditions  adverse changes in the issuers economic, regulatory or political environment Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Policy Liabilities Aflacs products are generally long-duration fixed-benefit indemnity contracts. As such, our products are accounted for under the requirements of SFAS No.60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises. We make estimates of certain factors that affect the profitability of our business to match expected policy benefits and deferrable acquisition costs with expected policy premiums. These assumptions include persistency, morbidity, mortality, investment yields and expenses. If actual results match the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs, profits will emerge as a level percentage of earned premiums. However, because actual results will vary from the assumptions, profits as a percentage of earned premiums will vary from year to year.
We measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business. Our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are adequate and that our DAC is recoverable.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Under the requirements of SFAS No.60, certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the policys premium payment period in proportion to anticipated premium income. Future amortization of DAC is based upon our estimates of persistency, interest, and future premium revenue generally established at the time of policy issuance. However, the unamortized balance of DAC reflects actual persistency. As presented in the following table, the ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has been relatively stable for Aflac U.S. over the last three years. The ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has shown a slight upward trend for Aflac Japan for the last three years. This trend is a result of a greater proportion of our annualized premiums being under the alternative commission schedule, which pays a higher commission on first-year premiums and lower commissions on renewal premiums. This schedule is very popular with our new agents as it helps them with cash flow for personal and business needs as they build their II- 7 Table of Contents business. While this has resulted in a higher unamortized DAC balance, the overall cost to the company has been reduced.

Future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums. We calculate future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality, persistency and interest. These assumptions are generally established at the time a policy II- 8 Table of Contents is issued. The assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing the gross premiums for a policy. As required by GAAP, we also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience.
Unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us. We compute unpaid policy claims on an undiscounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments, adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. We update the assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporate our historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our outstanding liability.
Our insurance products provide fixed-benefit amounts that are not subject to medical-cost inflation. Furthermore, our business is widely dispersed in both the United States and Japan. This geographic dispersion and the nature of our benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature. Claims incurred under Aflacs policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short time frame. The unpaid claims liability is sensitive to morbidity assumptions, in particular, severity and frequency of claims. Severity is the ultimate size of a claim, and frequency is the number of claims incurred. Our claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of our policyholders.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, we increased Aflacs U.S. unpaid policy claims liability by $28million. As part of our analysis of recent cancer claims experience, we noted that the overall duration of cancer outpatient treatments has lengthened. Since our reserving methods are designed to fully accrue each cancer outpatient treatment as of the date of initial treatment, we increased our estimate of the Aflac U.S. unpaid policy claims liability by $28 million. This change in estimate is reflected in current years earnings. If we had been using the new claims factors to produce our claim liability estimates at the end of 2005, the increase for 2006 would have been $9 million. We expect that the annual impact on future earnings will be approximately $9 million.
In addition, during the fourth quarter we transferred $170 million of the Aflac U.S. unpaid policy claims liability to future policy benefits. This transfer was primarily related to new product lines where early policy duration claims have been lower than we anticipated. However, our analysis indicates that it is appropriate to hold this liability in future policy benefits. This transfer had no impact on net earnings.
Also during the fourth quarter of 2006, we transferred $85 million from Aflac Japans unpaid policy claims liability to its future policy benefits liability. This transfer, which was primarily related to a continued decline in current period claims caused by changes to health care delivery in Japan, had no effect on net earnings. Our 2006 claims review indicated that we experienced a continued decline in the average number of hospital days associated with the typical cancer treatment period in Japan. We believe the average number of days declined primarily due to changes in financial incentives provided to hospitals by the government-sponsored health care system in Japan to shorten the average hospital stay. However, our claims statistics also indicated that the declines in the average number of days per hospitalization are generally offset by an increase in the frequency of II- 9 Table of Contents hospitalizations associated with the treatment of cancer. This shift reduced current period claims, and future period claims are anticipated to increase by similar amounts.
In computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, we consider many factors, including the benefits and amounts available under the policy; the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims; and internal business practices, such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices. We monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges. Claim levels are generally stable from period to period; however, fluctuations in claim levels may occur. In calculating the unpaid policy claim liability, we do not calculate a range of estimates. The following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid policy claims liability as of December31, 2006, to changes in severity and frequency of claims. For the years 2004 through 2006, and before the effect of the fourth quarter 2006 adjustments noted above, our assumptions changed on average by approximately 1% in total, and we believe that a variation in assumptions in a range of plus or minus 1% in total is reasonably likely to occur.

II- 10 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table is a presentation of items impacting net earnings and net earnings per diluted share for the years ended December31.
Items Impacting Net Earnings InMillions PerDilutedShare 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Net earnings $ 1,483 $ 1,483 $ 1,266 $ 2.95 $ 2.92 $ 2.45 Items   impacting net earnings, net of tax: Realized investment gains (losses) 51 167 (5 ) .10 .33 (.01 ) Impact from SFAS 133 - (10 ) (13 ) - (.02 ) (.03 ) Release of deferred tax asset valuation   allowance - 34 128 - .07 .25 Japanese pension obligation transfer - - 3 - - .01 Realized Investment Gains and Losses Our investment strategy is to invest in fixed-income securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the Companys profitability. We do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses. However, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and/or general portfolio maintenance and rebalancing. The realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products, which are the principal drivers of our profitability.
In 2006, we realized pretax gains of $79 million (after-tax, $51 million, or $.10 per diluted share) primarily as a result of bond swaps and the liquidation of equity securities held by Aflac U.S. In 2005, we realized pretax gains of $262 million (after-tax, $167 million, or $.33 per diluted share) primarily as a result of bond swaps. We began our bond-swap program in the second half of 2005 and concluded it in the first half of 2006. These bond swaps took advantage of tax loss carryforwards and also resulted in an improvement in overall portfolio credit quality and investment income.
During 2004, we received an issuers offer to redeem certain available-for-sale yen-denominated debt securities held by the Company. We accepted the issuers offer of $205 million and recorded a pretax loss of $23 million. This investment loss and other investment gains and losses in the normal course of business decreased 2004 pretax earnings by $12 million (after-tax, $5 million, or $.01 per diluted share).
Impact from SFAS 133 We entered into cross-currency swap agreements to effectively convert our dollar-denominated senior notes, which mature in 2009, into a yen-denominated obligation (see Notes 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The effect of issuing fixed-rate, dollar-denominated debt and swapping it into fixed-rate, yen-denominated debt has the same economic impact on Aflac II- 11 Table of Contents as if we had issued yen-denominated debt of a like amount. However, the accounting treatment for cross-currency swaps is different from issuing yen-denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes. SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133), requires that the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, be reflected in net earnings (other income). This change in fair value is determined by relative dollar and yen interest rates and has no cash impact on our results of operations. At maturity, the fair value will equal initial contract fair value, and the cumulative impact of gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the interest component will be zero. We have the ability and intent to retain the cross-currency swaps until their maturity. The impact from SFAS 133 includes the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps, which does not qualify for hedge accounting.
We have also issued yen-denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes. We have designated these notes as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. If the value of these yen-denominated notes and the notional amounts of the cross-currency swaps exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, we would be required to recognize the foreign currency effect on the excess, or ineffective portion, in net earnings (other income). The ineffective portion would be included in the impact from SFAS 133. These hedges were effective during the three-year period ended December31, 2006; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings.
During the third quarter of 2006, we entered into interest rate swap agreements related to the 20billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes (see Notes 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). By entering into these contracts, we have been able to lock in the interest rate at 1.52% in yen. We have designated these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the variable interest rate Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no value at inception. SFAS 133 requires that the change in the fair value of the swap contracts be recorded in other comprehensive income so long as the hedge is deemed effective. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in net earnings (other income). The impact from SFAS 133 would include any ineffectiveness associated with these interest rate swaps. The fair value of these swaps and related changes in fair value were immaterial during the year ended December31, 2006. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Nonrecurring Items We received regulatory approval for a change in the allocation of expenses under the management fee agreement between Aflac and the Parent Company in 2005. This enabled the Parent Company to fully utilize its tax-basis, non-life operating losses and therefore release the valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax assets, resulting in a benefit of $34 million ($.07per diluted share) in 2005.
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 eliminated the 90% limitation on the utilization of foreign tax credits. As a result of this tax law change, we recognized a benefit of $128 million ($.25 per diluted share) in 2004 for the release of the valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax II- 12 Table of Contents assets. The 2005 and 2004 tax benefits are included as reductions to income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.
During 2004, we concluded the process of returning the substitutional portion of Aflac Japans pension plan to the Japanese government as allowed by the Japan Pension Insurance Law. We recognized a one-time gain (other income) as the result of this transfer to the Japanese government in the amount of $6 million (after-tax, $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share) in 2004.
Foreign Currency Translation Aflac Japans premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we primarily purchase yen-denominated assets to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen-denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. We translate Aflac Japans yen-denominated income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate its yen-denominated balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars.
Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not an economic event to our Company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, management evaluates Aflacs financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.
Income Taxes Our combined U.S. and Japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was 34.5% in 2006, 33.4% in 2005, and 28.6% in 2004. Total income taxes were $781 million in 2006, compared with $743 million in 2005 and $507 million in 2004. Japanese income taxes on Aflac Japans results account for most of our consolidated income tax expense. Our 2005 income tax rate was lower than normal primarily as a result of the release of the valuation allowance for non-life losses discussed previously. Our 2004 income tax rate and tax expense were also lower than normal as a result of the release of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets discussed previously. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
II- 13 Table of Contents Earnings Guidance We communicate earnings guidance in this report based on the growth in net earnings per diluted share. However, certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside of managements control may have a significant impact on actual results. Therefore, our comparison of net earnings includes certain assumptions to reflect the limitations that are inherent in projections of net earnings. In comparing year-over-year results, we exclude the effect of realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133 and nonrecurring items. We also assume no impact from foreign currency translation on the Aflac Japan segment and the Parent Companys yen-denominated interest expense for a given year in relation to the prior year.
Subject to the preceding assumptions, our objective for 2006 was to achieve net earnings per diluted share of at least $2.92, an increase of 15.0% over 2005 using the preceding assumptions. We reported 2006 net earnings per diluted share of $2.95. Adjusting that number for realized investment gains ($.10per diluted share), the impact from SFAS 133 (nil per diluted share) and foreign currency translation (a loss of $.08 per diluted share), we exceeded our objective for the year.
Our objective for 2007 is to increase net earnings per diluted share by 15% to 16% over 2006, on the basis described above.
If we achieve this objective, the following table shows the likely results for 2007 net earnings per diluted share, including the impact of foreign currency translation using various yen/dollar exchange rate scenarios.

GAAP financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual financial statements. Furthermore, we are required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets.
We measure and evaluate our insurance segments financial performance using operating earnings on a pretax basis. We define segment operating earnings as the profits we derive from our II- 14 Table of Contents operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. We believe that an analysis of segment pretax operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is conducted in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact of translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars.
We evaluate our sales efforts using new annualized premium sales, an industry operating measure. Total new annualized premium sales, which include new sales and the incremental increase in premiums due to conversions, represent the premiums that we would collect over a 12-month period, assuming the policies remain in force. Premium income, or earned premiums, is a financial performance measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period.
II- 15 Table of Contents AFLAC JAPAN SEGMENT Aflac Japan Pretax Operating Earnings Changes in Aflac Japans pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency, and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac Japan.

The percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of 5.4% in 2006 and 6.8% in both 2005 and 2004, reflect the high persistency of Aflac Japans business and the sales of new policies. Annualized premiums in force at December31, 2006, were 1.08 trillion yen, compared with 1.03 trillion yen in 2005 and 961.9 billion yen in 2004. Annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year-end exchange rates, were $9.1 billion in 2006, $8.7 billion in 2005 and $9.2 billion in 2004.
Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar-denominated and reverse-dual currency securities (yen-denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). Dollar-denominated investment income from these assets accounted for approximately 37% of Aflac Japans investment income in 2006, II- 16 Table of Contents compared with 32% in 2005 and 30% in 2004. In years when the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar, translating Aflac Japans dollar-denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. In years when the yen weakens, translating dollar-denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. On a constant currency basis, dollar-denominated investment income accounted for approximately 36% of Aflac Japans investment income during 2006, compared with 32% in both 2005 and 2004.
The following table illustrates the effect of translating Aflac Japans dollar-denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had yen/dollar exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year.

The following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac Japan.

The benefit ratio has declined over the past several years, reflecting the impact of newer products with lower loss ratios. We have also experienced favorable claim trends in our major product lines. We expect the benefit ratio to continue to decline in future years primarily reflecting the shift to newer products and riders. However, this decline is partially offset by the effect of low investment yields, which impacts our profit margin by reducing the spread between investment yields and required interest on policy reserves (see table and discussion on PageII-27 ). The operating expense ratio was higher in 2005 as a result of additional advertising expenditures and the write-off of previously capitalized systems development costs. We expect the operating expense ratio to be relatively stable II- 17 Table of Contents in 2007. Due to improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded to 15.8% in 2006. We expect continued expansion in the profit margin in 2007.
Aflac Japan Sales Aflac Japans total new annualized premium sales declined 8.8% in 2006. The sales decline primarily reflected industry-wide weakness in the market for stand-alone medical insurance as well as continued declines in the sale of Rider MAX. The following table presents Aflac Japans total new annualized premium sales for the years ended December31.
InDollars InYen (Inmillionsofdollarsandbillionsofyen) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Total new   annualized premium sales $ 1,010 $ 1,167 $ 1,133 117.5 128.8 122.5 Percentage change over prior year (13.5 )% 3.0 % 8.2 % (8.8 )% 5.1 % 1.1 % Aflac Japans sales mix has been shifting during the last few years.

We expect this weakness will continue into 2007. However, with continued cost pressure on Japans health care system, we expect demand for medical products will continue to rise in the future and we remain encouraged about the outlook for the medical insurance market. Although that market is very competitive, Aflac Japan retains the distinction of being the number one seller of stand-alone medical insurance in Japan. We believe that our number one position benefits us in the marketplace. As a result, we continue to believe that the medical category will be an important part of our product portfolio.
The ordinary life category increased 16.9% in 2006, benefiting from the sale of WAYS, the innovative life insurance product we introduced in January2006. Unlike traditional life insurance, WAYS allows a policyholder to convert a portion of the life insurance coverage to medical, nursing care, or fixed annuity benefits at retirement age. We remain very pleased with the initial response to WAYS, which accounted for approximately 8% of new sales in 2006.
In June2006, we began selling a new cancer plan aimed at existing cancer insurance policyholders. This new product provides additional benefits for inpatient and outpatient care. Our II- 18 Table of Contents cancer life policies are also marketed by Dai-ichi Mutual Life and in June2006, Dai-ichi Life began selling a new cancer product customized for their market. As a result, new sales from cancer insurance products were stable in 2006. We are convinced that the affordable cancer products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio.
We continue to expect 2007 to be a challenging year from a sales perspective and look for sales to again decline in the first half of the year, followed by modest sales increases in the second half of 2007.
Aflac Japan Investments Growth of investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations, timing of and yields on new investments, and the effect of yen/dollar exchange rates on dollar-denominated investment income. Aflac Japan has invested in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than Japanese government or other public corporate bonds would have provided, while still adhering to prudent standards for credit quality. All of our privately issued securities are rated investment grade at the time of purchase. These securities are generally issued with standard documentation for medium-term note programs and have appropriate covenants.
The following table presents the results of Aflac Japans investment activities for the years ended December31.
2006 2005 2004 New money   yield - yen only 3.10 % 2.95 % 2.94 % New money   yield - blended 3.33 3.19 3.13 Return on average invested assets, net of   investment expenses 4.11 4.14 4.26 At December31, 2006, the yield on Aflac Japans investment portfolio, including dollar-denominated investments, was 4.14%, compared with 4.22% a year ago. See Investments and Cash on PageII-28 for additional information.
Japanese Economy Recent events indicate that Japans economy has begun to recover. The Bank of Japans January2007 Monthly Report of Recent Economic& Financial Developments stated that Japans economy is expanding moderately, noting increases in exports and capital expenditures and moderate increases in household income, private consumption and housing investment, all against the backdrop of high corporate profits and expansion of overseas economies. The report did note a downward trend related to public investment and projected the trend to continue. However, it also included an expectation that the economy would continue to expand moderately, supported by expectations of increasing exports and domestic private demand. Nevertheless, the time required for a full economic recovery remains uncertain.
II- 19 Table of Contents Japans system of compulsory public health care insurance provides medical coverage to every Japanese citizen. These public medical expenditures are covered by a combination of premiums paid by insureds and their employers, taxes, and copayments from the people who receive medical service. However, given Japans aging population, the resources available to these publicly funded social insurance programs have come under increasing pressure. As a result, copayments and other out-of-pocket expenses have been rising and affecting more people. In 2003, copayments were raised from 20% to 30% for most consumers and other reforms were implemented in 2006. Additional reforms are being considered. We believe higher out-of-pocket expenses will lead more consumers to purchase supplemental insurance plans. Many insurance companies have recognized the opportunities for selling supplemental medical insurance in Japan and have launched new products in recent years. However, we believe our favorable cost structure compared with other insurers makes us a very effective competitor. In addition, we believe our brand, customer service, and financial strength also benefit our market position.
Japanese Regulatory Environment The FSA adopted new mortality tables effective April1, 2007, that will be used when developing our policy premium and reserving assumptions on newly underwritten policies. These new tables reflect recent improvements in survival rates in Japan. If our other assumptions remain unchanged, these revisions will generally lead to a decrease in policy premiums for death benefit products and an increase in premium rates for third sector products and annuities.
Additionally, the FSA has implemented a new rulefor third sector product reserving. The new reserving rulewill be implemented in the Japanese fiscal year starting April1, 2007. Under the new rule, we are required to conduct stress testing of our reserves using a prescribed method that incorporates actual incidence rates. The results of the tests and their relation to our reserves determine whether reserve strengthening is required. We do not anticipate that the new reserving requirements will have a material impact on our FSA-based financial statements or our pricing.
As disclosed in our third quarter 2006 Form10-Q, Aflac Japan, along with the entire life insurance industry, began a review of the last five years of paid claims to determine if those claims were paid fully and accurately. In a recent notification from the FSA, the review process has been changed from a voluntary program to one that is mandatory and has been expanded to include a review of cash surrender value payments. Additionally, the FSA established a reporting deadline of April 13, 2007. We expect to complete our review of claims and cash surrender value payments and report our findings to the FSA within the time frame specified. As a result of this review, we have found some payment errors and we are correcting them. Additionally, we are using this review to identify process changes that will help ensure that payment errors such as these are not repeated. Although immaterial to our financial statements, we have recorded a liability for our estimate of the underpaid portion of those claims in our 2006 financial statements.
II- 20 Table of Contents AFLAC U.S. SEGMENT Aflac U.S. Pretax Operating Earnings Changes in Aflac U.S. pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac U.S.
Aflac U.S. Summary of Operating Results (Inmillions) 2006 2005 2004 Premium income $ 3,552 $ 3,245 $ 2,935 Net investment income 465 421 396 Other income 10 10 9 Total operating revenues 4,027 3,676 3,340 Benefits and claims 2,169 1,991 1,803 Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred   policy acquisition costs 290 258 245 Insurance commissions 444 410 371 Insurance and other expenses 539 492 424 Total operating expenses 1,273 1,160 1,040 Total benefits and expenses 3,442 3,151 2,843 Pretax operating earnings* $ 585 $ 525 $ 497 Percentage   change over previous year: Premium income 9.5 % 10.6 % 13.1 % Net investment income 10.4 6.5 9.4 Total operating revenues 9.5 10.0 12.6 Pretax operating earnings* 11.4 5.6 11.7 *See PageII-14 for our definition of segment operating earnings.
The percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force of 10.5% in 2006, 10.0% in 2005, and 10.9% in 2004 were favorably affected by increased sales at the worksite primarily through cafeteria plans and a slight improvement in the persistency of several products. Annualized premiums in force at December31 were $4.1 billion in 2006, compared with $3.7 billion in 2005 and $3.4 billion in 2004.
II- 21 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac U.S.
Ratiostototalrevenues: 2006 2005 2004 Benefits and claims 53.9 % 54.2 % 54.0 % Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred   policy acquisition costs 7.2 7.0 7.3 Insurance commissions 11.0 11.2 11.1 Insurance and other expenses 13.4 13.3 12.7 Total operating expenses 31.6 31.5 31.1 Pretax operating earnings* 14.5 14.3 14.9 *See PageII-14 for our definition of segment operating earnings.
After several years of trending upward, the benefit ratio declined modestly in 2006. As a percentage of premium income, the benefit ratio was 61.0% in 2006, 61.3% in 2005, and 61.4% in 2004. We expect the benefit ratio to decline slightly in future periods due to favorable claim cost trends. The 2006 operating expense ratio reflects the write-off of remaining deferred policy acquisition costs associated with a large payroll account that terminated in the first quarter. We expect the operating expense ratio, excluding discretionary promotional expenses, to remain relatively stable in future periods. The pretax operating profit margin is expected to increase slightly in 2007.
Aflac U.S. Sales For 2006, total new annualized premium sales increased 13.1%, which exceeded our objective of 8% to 12% growth for the year. These record sales results were due, in part, to the re-enrollment of a large payroll account. Our accident/disability and cancer expense products were again the primary contributors to sales. The following table presents Aflacs U.S. total new annualized premium sales for the years ended December31.

During the third quarter of 2006, we launched revised specified health event and intensive care plans. In 2007 we will introduce an innovative care policy that provides benefits to help offset costs associated with caring for dependents as a result of their accident or illness.
Another aspect of our growth strategy is our focus on growing and improving our U.S. sales force, and we were encouraged to see continued expansion in 2006. Although we did not set a specific recruiting target for 2006, we continued to emphasize recruiting as a means for growing our producer base. We recruited more than 26,000 new associates during 2006, which was 7.8% higher than 2005. At December31, 2006, Aflac U.S. was represented by more than 68,300 licensed sales associates, which was 8.5% higher than a year ago. Our primary focus has been on increasing producing sales associates. We believe that we can achieve better producer growth through more effective and standardized training for our sales associates and sales management. On an average weekly basis, the number of producing associates rose 6.4% in 2006 to approximately 10,300, compared with a year ago. As previously disclosed, our focus has shifted from average monthly producers to average weekly producers as both a reporting and management metric. This shift provides for a more active management of our sales associates and allows our sales management to monitor progress and needs on a real-time basis.
Aflac U.S. Investments The following table presents the results of Aflacs U.S. investment activities.
2006 2005 2004 New money yield 6.44 % 6.16 % 6.30 % Return on average invested assets, net of investment expenses 6.86 6.54 6.68 At December31, 2006, the portfolio yield on Aflacs U.S. portfolio was 7.15%, compared with 7.24% a year ago. See Investments and Cash on PageII-28 for additional information.
OTHER OPERATIONS Corporate operating expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation, benefits, and facilities expenses. Corporate expenses, excluding investment income, were $57 million in 2006, $56 million in 2005, and $67 million in 2004. Investment income included in reported corporate expenses was $16million in 2006, $14 million in 2005, and $5 million in 2004. Corporate expenses in 2004 were higher than normal primarily as a result of increased expenses associated with our retirement obligations.
II- 23 Table of Contents ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION Our financial condition has remained strong in the functional currencies of our operations during the last two years. The yen/dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to translate yen-denominated balance sheet items to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The exchange rate at December31, 2006, was 119.11 yen to one dollar, or .9% weaker than the December31, 2005, exchange rate of 118.07. The weaker yen decreased reported investments and cash by $357 million; total assets by $400 million; and total liabilities by $392 million, compared with the amounts that would have been reported for 2006 if the exchange rate had remained unchanged from December31, 2005.
Market Risks of Financial Instruments Because we invest in fixed-income securities, our financial instruments are exposed primarily to two types of market risks: currency risk and interest rate risk.
Currency Risk The functional currency of Aflac Japans insurance operation is the Japanese yen. All of Aflac Japans premiums, claims and commissions are received or paid in yen, as are most of its investment income and other expenses. Furthermore, m ost of Aflac Japans investments, cash and liabilities are yen-denominated. When yen-denominated securities mature or are sold, the proceeds are generally reinvested in yen-denominated securities. Aflac Japan holds these yen-denominated assets to fund its yen-denominated policy obligations. In addition, Aflac Incorporated has yen-denominated notes payable and cross-currency swaps related to its dollar-denominated senior notes.
Although we generally do not convert yen into dollars, we do translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, reported amounts are affected by foreign currency fluctuations. We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income.
On a consolidated basis, we attempt to minimize the exposure of shareholders equity to foreign currency translation fluctuations. We accomplish this by investing a portion of Aflac Japans investment portfolio in dollar-denominated securities, by the Parent Companys issuance of yen-denominated debt and by the use of cross-currency swaps (see Hedging Activities on PageII-35 for additional information). As a result, the effect of currency fluctuations on our net assets is mitigated. The dollar values of our yen-denominated net assets, which are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations for financial reporting purposes, are summarized as follows (translated at end-of-period exchange rates) for the years ended December31: (Inmillions) 2006 2005 Aflac   Japan yen-denominated net assets $ 2,317 $ 2,184 Parent Company yen-denominated net   liabilities (1,434 ) ( 1,403 ) Consolidated yen-denominated net assets subject to foreigncurrency   translation fluctuations $ 883 $ 781 II- 24 Table of Contents The following table demonstrates the effect of foreign currency fluctuations by presenting the dollar values of our yen-denominated assets and liabilities, and our consolidated yen-denominated net asset exposure at selected exchange rates as of December31.

This primarily occurs when we repatriate funds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S., which is done annually. The exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation will differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. These repatriations have not been greater than 80% of Aflac Japans prior year earnings determined in accordance with standards established by the FSA. A portion of the repatriation may be used to service Aflac Incorporateds yen-denominated notes payable with the remainder converted into dollars.
II- 25 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our primary interest rate exposure is to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt securities. We use modified duration analysis, which measures price percentage volatility, to estimate the sensitivity of fair values to interest rate changes on debt securities we own. For example, if the current duration of a debt security is 10, then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately 10% if market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. Likewise, the fair value of the debt security will decrease by approximately 10% if market interest rates increase by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant.
The estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on the fair values of debt securities we own, notes payable, cross-currency swaps and our obligation for the Japanese policyholder protection fund as of December31 follows: Sensitivity of Fair Values of Financial Instruments to Interest Rate Changes 2006 2005 +100 +100 Fair Basis Fair Basis (Inmillions) Value Points Value Points Debt securities: Fixed-maturity securities: Yen-denominated $ 32,328 $ 28,712 $ 29,791 $ 26,427 Dollar-denominated 9,845 9,033 9,190 8,407 Perpetual debentures: Yen-denominated 7,735 6,965 7,911 7,086 Dollar-denominated 698 653 711 661 Total debt securities $ 50,606 $ 45,363 $ 47,603 $ 42,581 Notes payable* $ 1,421 $ 1,386 $ 1,395 $ 1,362 Cross-currency and interest rate swap liabilities $ 7 $ 5 $ 12 $ 10 Japanese   policyholder protection fund $ 175 $ 175 $ 203 $ 203 *Excludes capitalized lease obligations Changes in the interest rate environment have contributed to the unrealized gains on debt securities we own. However, we do not expect to realize a majority of these unrealized gains because we have the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Likewise, should significant amounts of unrealized losses occur because of increases in market yields, we would not expect to realize these losses because we have the intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity or recovery of value. For additional information on unrealized losses on debt securities, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
II- 26 Table of Contents We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. The following table presents the approximate duration of our yen-denominated assets and liabilities, along with premiums, as of December31.

In Japan, we lowered our required interest assumption for some newly issued products to 2.5% in 2005. However, the majority of Japans newly issued products have a required interest assumption of 3.0%. We continue to monitor the spread between our new money yield and the required interest assumption for newly issued products in both the United States and Japan and will re-evaluate those assumptions as necessary.
Over the next two years, we have yen-denominated securities that will mature with yields in excess of Aflac Japans current net investment yield of 3.88%. These securities total $1.1 billion at amortized cost and have an average yield of 5.80%. Currently, when debt securities we own mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. As a result, securities that mature may contribute to a decline in our overall portfolio yield. However, adding riders to our older policies has helped offset the negative investment spread. And despite negative investment spreads, adequate overall profit margins still exist in Aflac Japans aggregate block of business because of profits that have emerged from changes in mix of business and favorable experience from mortality, morbidity, and expenses.
II- 27 Table of Contents Investments and Cash Our investment philosophy is to maximize investment income while emphasizing liquidity, safety and quality. Our investment objective, subject to appropriate risk constraints, is to fund policyholder obligations and other liabilities in a manner that enhances shareholders equity. We seek to achieve this objective through a diversified portfolio of fixed-income investments that reflects the characteristics of the liabilities it supports.
Aflac invests primarily within the debt securities markets.
The following table details investment securities by segment as of December31.

We have investments in both publicly issued and privately issued securities. However, the status of issuance should not be viewed as an indicator of liquidity or as a limitation on the determination of fair value. The outstanding amount(s)of a particular issuance, as well as the level of activity in a particular issuance and the state of the market, including credit events and the interest rate environment, affect liquidity regardless of type of issuance. We routinely assess the fair value of all of our investments. This process includes evaluating quotations provided by outside securities pricing sources and/or compiled using data provided by external debt and equity market sources, as described more fully in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table details investment securities by type of issuance as of December31.

Privately issued securities held by Aflac Japan at amortized cost accounted for $31.3 billion, or 64.0%, of total debt securities at December31, 2006, and $27.9 billion, or 61.8%, of total debt securities at December31, 2005. Reverse-dual currency debt securities accounted for $9.7 billion, or 28.9%, of total privately issued securities at December31, 2006, compared with $8.9 billion, or 29.6%, of total privately issued securities at December31, 2005. Aflac Japan has invested in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than those available from Japanese government bonds. Aflac Japans investments in yen-denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non-Japanese issuers and have longer maturities, thereby allowing us to improve our asset/liability matching and our overall investment returns. Most of our privately issued securities are issued under medium-term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and/or event-risk covenants are required.
Our investment activities expose us to credit risk, which is a consequence of extending credit and/or carrying investment positions. However, we continue to adhere to prudent standards for credit quality. We accomplish this by considering our product needs and overall corporate objectives, in addition to credit risk. Our investment policy requires that all securities be rated investment grade at the time of purchase. In evaluating the initial rating, we look at the overall senior issuer rating, the explicit rating for the actual issue or the rating for the security class, and, where applicable, the appropriate designation from the Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). All of our securities have ratings from either a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or the SVO of the NAIC. In addition, we perform extensive internal credit reviews to ensure that we are consistent in applying rating criteria for all of our securities.
We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. Furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and II- 29 Table of Contents internal credit analysis. The distributions by credit rating of our purchases of debt securities for the years ended December31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows: Composition of Purchases by Credit Rating 2006 2005 2004 AAA 10.6 % 6.1 % 9.1 % AA 48.9 45.5 41.2 A 35.1 42.9 36.7 BBB 5.4 5.5 13.0 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The distributions of debt securities we own, by credit rating, were as follows: Composition by Credit Rating December31,2006 December31,2005 Amortized Fair Amortized Fair Cost Value Cost Value AAA 5.8 % 5.7 % 4.0 % 3.9 % AA 35.0 35.8 33.7 34.9 A 39.4 39.2 38.9 38.7 BBB 17.2 17.2 21.1 20.6 BB or lower 2.6 2.1 2.3 1.9 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The overall credit quality of our portfolio remained high in part because our investment policy prohibits us from purchasing below-investment-grade securities. In the event of a credit rating downgrade to below-investment-grade status, we do not automatically liquidate our position. However, if the security is in the held-to-maturity portfolio, we immediately transfer it to the available-for-sale portfolio so that the securitys fair value and its unrealized gain/loss are reflected on the balance sheet.
Once we designate a security as below investment grade, we intensify our monitoring of the issuer. We do not automatically recognize an impairment if the securitys amortized cost exceeds its fair value. Our investment management starts by reviewing its credit analysis. Included in this process are an evaluation of the issuer, its current credit posture and an assessment of the future prospects for the issuer. We then obtain fair value information from at least three independent pricing sources. Upon determining the fair value, we move our focus to an analysis of whether or not the decline in fair value, if any, is other than temporary. For securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value, investment management then reviews the issue based on our impairment policy to determine if the investment should be impaired and/or liquidated. The assessment of whether a decline is other than II- 30 Table of Contents temporary requires significant management judgment and is discussed more fully in the Critical Accounting Estimates section on PageII-6 .

This occurs when one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade. Our policy is to review each issue on a case-by-case basis to determine if a split-rated security should be classified as investment grade or below investment grade. Our review includes evaluating the issuers credit position as well as current market pricing and other factors, such as the issuers or securitys inclusion on a credit rating downgrade watch list.

Declines in fair value noted above resulted from changes in interest rates, yen/dollar exchange rates, and issuer credit status. However, we believe that it would be inappropriate to recognize impairment charges because we believe the changes in fair value are temporary. Based on our evaluation and analysis of specific issuers in accordance with our impairment policy, impairment charges recognized in each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2006 were immaterial.

Deferred policy acquisition costs of Aflac U.S. increased 10.3%. The increase in deferred policy acquisition costs was primarily driven by total new annualized premium sales.
II- 34 Table of Contents Policy Liabilities Policy liabilities totaled $45.4 billion at December31, 2006, an increase of $3.1 billion, or 7.3% over 2005. The following table presents policy liabilities by segment for the years ending December31.

Policy liabilities of Aflac U.S. increased 12.5%. The increase in total policy liabilities is the result of the growth and aging of our in-force business.
Notes Payable Notes payable totaled $1.4 billion at both December31, 2006 and 2005. The ratio of debt to total capitalization (debt plus shareholders equity, excluding the unrealized gains and losses on investment securities) was 17.2% as of December31, 2006, compared with 18.8% a year ago. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Benefit Plans Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan have various benefit plans. For additional information on our U.S. and Japanese plans, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Policyholder Protection Fund The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. In 2002, the members of the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC) approved the Financial Services Agencys proposal, which increased the industrys obligation to the policyholder protection fund. In 2005, legislation was enacted extending the LIPPC framework, which included government fiscal measures supporting the LIPPC through March2009. These new measures do not contemplate additional industry assessments through March2009 absent an event requiring LIPPC funds. The likelihood and timing of future assessments, if any, cannot be determined at this time.
Hedging Activities Aflac has limited hedging activities. Our primary exposure to be hedged is our investment in Aflac Japan, which is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. To mitigate this exposure, we have taken the following courses of action. First, Aflac Japan owns dollar-denominated securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. Second, we have designated the Parent Companys yen-denominated liabilities (Samurai and Uridashi notes payable and cross-currency swaps) as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. If the total of these II- 35 Table of Contents yen-denominated liabilities is equal to or less than our net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective and the related exchange effect is reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. Should these yen-denominated liabilities exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, the portion of the hedge that exceeds our investment in Aflac Japan would be deemed ineffective. As required by SFAS No.133, we would then recognize the foreign exchange effect on the ineffective portion in net earnings (other income). We estimate that if the ineffective portion was 10billion yen, we would report a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $1 million for every one yen weakening/strengthening in the end-of-period yen/dollar exchange rate. At December31, 2006, our hedge was effective with yen-denominated assets exceeding yen-denominated liabilities by 105.4 billion yen, compared with 92.3 billion yen at December31, 2005.
During the third quarter of 2006, we entered into interest rate swap agreements related to the 20billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes. By entering into these contracts, we have been able to lock in our interest rate at 1.52% in yen. We have designated these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the variable interest rate Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no value at inception. Changes in the fair value of the swap contracts are recorded in other comprehensive income. The fair value of these swaps and related changes in fair value were immaterial during the year ended December31, 2006.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December31, 2006, we had no material unconditional purchase obligations that were not recorded on the balance sheet. Additionally, we had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the Parent Company through dividends and management fees. Aflac declared dividends to the Parent Company in the amount of $665 million in 2006, compared with $526 million in 2005 and $643 million in 2004. During 2006, Aflac paid $68million to the Parent Company for management fees, compared with $73 million in 2005 and $33million in 2004. The increase in management fees in 2005 resulted from a change in the allocation of expenses under the management fee agreement between Aflac and the Parent Company. The primary uses of cash by the Parent Company are shareholder dividends and our share repurchase program. The Parent Companys sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and are not expected to change materially in the future.
The Parent Company also accesses debt security markets to provide additional sources of capital. Capital is primarily used to fund business expansion and capital expenditures. In 2003, we filed a Shelf Registration Statement (SRS) with Japanese regulatory authorities to issue up to 100 billion yen of Samurai notes in Japan. In July2005, we issued 40 billion yen (approximately $360 million) of these securities with a coupon of .71% and a five-year maturity. These securities are not available to U.S. persons. The remaining 60 billion yen of the 2003 SRS expired in December2005. As a result, II- 36 Table of Contents we filed a new SRS with Japanese regulatory authorities in February2006 to issue up to 100billion yen (approximately $840 million using the December31, 2006, exchange rate) of Samurai notes in Japan. If issued, these securities will not be available to U.S. persons. We also filed an SRS in August2006 with Japanese regulatory authorities to issue up to 100 billion yen (approximately $840 million using the December31, 2006, period-end exchange rate) of Uridashi notes in Japan. In September2006, the Parent Company issued 45 billion yen of yen-denominated Uridashi notes from this SRS. If issued, the remaining 55 billion yen of yen-denominated Uridashi notes will not be available to U.S. persons. We believe outside sources for additional debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available.
For additional information, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The principal sources of cash for our insurance operations are premiums and investment income. The primary uses of cash by our insurance operations are policy claims, commissions, operating expenses, income taxes and payments to the Parent Company for management fees and dividends. Both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable.
When making an investment decision, our first consideration is based on product needs. Our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the purchase of investment-grade debt securities. These objectives also take into account duration matching, and because of the long-term nature of our business, we have adequate time to react to changing cash flow needs.
As a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. Therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. We expect our future cash flows from premiums and our investment portfolio to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for benefits and expenses.
The following table presents the estimated payments by period of our major contractual obligations as of December31, 2006. We translated our yen-denominated obligations using the December31, 2006, exchange rate. Actual future payments as reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate.

**Not applicable.
II- 37 Table of Contents The distribution of payments for future policy benefits is an estimate of all future benefit payments for policies in force as of December31, 2006. These projected values contain assumptions for future policy persistency, mortality and morbidity. The distribution of payments for unpaid policy claims includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims. Actual amounts and timing of both future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims payments may differ significantly from the estimates above. We anticipate that the future policy benefit liability of $40.8 billion at December31, 2006, along with future net premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund future policy benefit payments.
Consolidated Cash Flows We translate cash flows for Aflac Japans yen-denominated items into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. In years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. The following table summarizes consolidated cash flows by activity for the years ended December31.

II- 38 Table of Contents Investing Activities Operating cash flow is primarily used to purchase debt securities to meet future policy obligations. The following table summarizes investing cash flows by source for the years ended December31.

Prudent portfolio management dictates that we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. Currently, when debt securities we own mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, the long-term nature of our business and our strong cash flows provide us with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and/or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. When market opportunities arise, we dispose of selected debt securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities and/or improve future investment yields. As a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year. Dispositions before maturity were approximately 7% of the annual average investment portfolio of debt securities available for sale during the year ended December31, 2006, compared with 11% in 2005 and 5% in 2004. The increase of dispositions before maturity in 2006 and 2005 primarily resulted from the bond swaps we executed from the third quarter of 2005 through the second quarter of 2006.
Financing Activities Consolidated cash used by financing activities was $434 million in 2006, $196 million in 2005 and $313 million in 2004. In September2006, we received $382 million in connection with the Parent Companys issuance of yen-denominated Uridashi notes. In June2006, the Parent Company paid $355 million in connection with the maturity of the 2001 Samurai notes. In October2005, we paid $261million in connection with the maturity of the 2000 Samurai notes. In July2005, the Parent Company received $360 million from its issuance of yen-denominated Samurai notes. Cash provided by investment-type contracts was $217 million in 2006, compared with $257 million in 2005 and $220 million in 2004.

The Nebraska insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by Aflac to the Parent Company. The Nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net gain from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. In addition, the Nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. These regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by Aflac to the Parent Company. A life insurance companys statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rulesprescribed by the NAIC, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance companys state of domicile. Statutory accounting rulesare different from GAAP and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency.
The continued long-term growth of our business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations. Aflacs insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by the Parent Company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings. The NAICs risk-based capital (RBC) formula is used by insurance regulators to facilitate identification of inadequately capitalized insurance companies. The RBC formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurers operations. Aflacs RBC ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and surplus position. Currently, the NAIC has ongoing regulatory initiatives relating to revisions to the RBC II- 40 Table of Contents formula as well as numerous initiatives covering insurance products, investments, and other actuarial and accounting matters. We believe that we will continue to maintain a strong RBC ratio and statutory capital and surplus position in future periods.
In addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by U.S. insurance regulators, Japans FSA may not allow profit repatriations or other transfers from Aflac Japan if they would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders. The FSA maintains its own solvency standard. Aflac Japans solvency margin ratio significantly exceeds regulatory minimums.
Payments are made from Aflac Japan to the Parent Company for management fees and to Aflac U.S. for allocated expenses and profit repatriations.
During 2006, Aflac Japan paid $25 million to the Parent Company for management fees, compared with $28 million in 2005 and $24 million in 2004.
Expenses allocated to Aflac Japan were $32 million in 2006, $30 million in 2005 and $26 million in 2004. During 2006, Aflac Japan repatriated profits of $442 million (50.0 billion yen) to Aflac U.S., compared with $374 million (41.2 billion yen) in 2005 and $220 million (23.9 billion yen) in 2004. Profits repatriated in 2004 were lower primarily as a result of realized investment losses recognized in 2003. For additional information on regulatory restrictions on dividends, profit repatriations and other transfers, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Rating Agencies Aflac is rated AA by both Standard& Poors and Fitch Ratings and Aa2 (Excellent) by Moodys for financial strength.A.M. Best assigned Aflac an A+ (Superior) rating for financial strength and operating performance. Aflac Incorporateds senior debt, Samurai notes, and Uridashi notes are rated A by Standard& Poors, A+ by Fitch Ratings, and A2 by Moodys.
Other In October2006, the board of directors declared the first quarter 2007 cash dividend of $.185 per share. The dividend is payable on March1, 2007, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February16, 2007. In 2004, the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 30 million shares of our common stock. In 2006, the board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional 30 million shares of our common stock. As of December31, 2006, approximately 37 million shares were available for purchase under our share repurchase programs.

II- 48 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business: Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (the Company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The Companys insurance business is marketed and administered through American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflacs policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business. Aflac Japan accounted for 72% of the Companys total revenues in 2006, 74% in 2005 and 75% in 2004, and 82% of total assets at both December31, 2006 and 2005.
Basis of Presentation: We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These principles are established primarily by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates when recording transactions resulting from business operations based on currently available information. The most significant items on our balance sheet that involve a greater degree of accounting estimates and actuarial determinations subject to changes in the future are the valuation of investments, deferred policy acquisition costs, and liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims. These accounting estimates and actuarial determinations are sensitive to market conditions, investment yields, mortality, morbidity, commission and other acquisition expenses, and terminations by policyholders. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates will be revised and reflected in operating results. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, we believe the amounts provided are adequate.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company, its majority-owned subsidiaries and those entities required to be consolidated under applicable accounting standards. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Translation of Foreign Currencies: The functional currency of Aflac Japans insurance operations is the Japanese yen. We translate our yen-denominated financial statement accounts into U.S. dollars as follows. Assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period exchange rates. Realized gains and losses on security transactions are translated at the exchange rate on the trade date of each transaction. Other revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated using average exchange rates for the year. The resulting currency translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. We include in earnings the realized currency exchange gains and losses resulting from transactions. Realized currency exchange gains and losses were immaterial during the three-year period ended December31, 2006.
Aflac Japan maintains an investment portfolio of dollar-denominated securities on behalf of Aflac U.S. The functional currency for these investments is the U.S. dollar. The related investment income and realized/unrealized investment gains and losses are also denominated in U.S. dollars.
II- 49 Table of Contents We have designated the yen-denominated Uridashi and Samurai notes issued by the Parent Company and the cross-currency swaps as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan (see the section in this note titled, Derivatives). Outstanding principal and related accrued interest on these items are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Insurance Revenue and Expense Recognition: The supplemental health and life insurance policies we issue are classified as long-duration contracts. The contract provisions generally cannot be changed or canceled during the contract period; however, we may adjust premiums for supplemental health policies issued in the United States within prescribed guidelines and with the approval of state insurance regulatory authorities.
Insurance premiums for health and life policies are recognized ratably as earned income over the premium payment periods of the policies. When revenues are reported, the related amounts of benefits and expenses are charged against such revenues, so that profits are recognized in proportion to premium revenues during the period the policies are expected to remain in force. This association is accomplished by means of annual additions to the liability for future policy benefits and the deferral and subsequent amortization of policy acquisition costs.
The calculation of deferred policy acquisition costs and the liability for future policy benefits requires the use of estimates consistent with sound actuarial valuation techniques. For new policy issues, we review our actuarial assumptions and deferrable acquisition costs each year and revise them when necessary to more closely reflect recent experience and studies of actual acquisition costs. For policies in force, we evaluate deferred policy acquisition costs by major product groupings to determine that they are recoverable from future revenues. Any resulting adjustment is charged against net earnings.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, money market instruments and other debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased.
Investments: Our debt securities include fixed-maturity securities and perpetual debentures, which are classified as either held to maturity or available for sale. Securities classified as held to maturity are securities that we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity or redemption and are carried at amortized cost. All other debt securities and our equity securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value. If the fair value is higher than the amortized cost for debt securities, or the purchase cost for equity securities, the excess is an unrealized gain, and if lower than cost, the difference is an unrealized loss.
The net unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, plus the unamortized unrealized gains and losses on debt securities transferred to the held-to-maturity portfolio, less related deferred income taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Amortized cost of debt securities is based on our purchase price adjusted for accrual of discount, or amortization of premium. The amortized cost of debt securities we purchase at a discount will equal the face or par value at maturity. Debt securities that we purchase at a premium will have an amortized cost equal to face or par value at maturity or the call date, if applicable. Interest is reported as income when earned and is adjusted for amortization of any premium or discount.
II- 50 Table of Contents Our investments in qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) are accounted for as fixed-maturity or perpetual securities. All of our investments in QSPEs are held in our available-for-sale portfolio.
For the collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) held in our fixed-maturity securities portfolio, we recognize income using a constant effective yield, which is based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments. The net investment in CMO securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied at the time of acquisition. This adjustment is reflected in net investment income.
We use the specific identification method to determine the gain or loss from securities transactions and report the realized gain or loss in the consolidated statements of earnings.
Our credit analysts and credit research personnel routinely monitor and evaluate the difference between the amortized cost and fair value of our investments. Additionally, credit analysis and/or credit rating issues related to specific investments may trigger more intensive monitoring to determine if a decline in fair value is other than temporary. For investments with a fair value below amortized cost, the process includes evaluating the length of time and the extent to which amortized cost exceeds fair value, the prospects and financial condition of the issuer, and our evaluation for a potential recovery in fair value, among other factors. This process is not exact and requires consideration of risks such as credit risk, which to a certain extent can be controlled, and interest rate risk, which cannot be controlled. Therefore, if an investments amortized cost exceeds its fair value solely due to changes in interest rates, impairment may not be appropriate. If, after monitoring and analyses, management believes that a decline in fair value is other than temporary, we adjust the amortized cost of the security and report a realized loss in the consolidated statements of earnings.
We lend fixed-maturity securities to financial institutions in short-term security lending transactions. These securities continue to be carried as investment assets on our balance sheet during the terms of the loans and are not reported as sales. We receive cash or other securities as collateral for such loans. For loans involving unrestricted cash collateral, the collateral is reported as an asset with a corresponding liability for the return of the collateral. For loans collateralized by securities, the collateral is not reported as an asset or liability.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs: The costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized with interest over the premium payment periods in proportion to the ratio of annual premium income to total anticipated premium income. Anticipated premium income is estimated by using the same mortality, persistency and interest assumptions used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits. In this manner, the related acquisition expenses are matched with revenues. Deferred costs include the excess of current-year commissions over ultimate renewal-year commissions and certain direct and allocated policy issue, underwriting and marketing expenses. All of these costs vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business.
Policy Liabilities: Future policy benefits represent claims that may occur in the future and are computed by a net level premium method using estimated future investment yields, persistency and recognized morbidity and mortality tables modified to reflect our experience, including a provision for adverse deviation. These assumptions are generally established at the time a policy is issued.
II- 51 Table of Contents Unpaid policy claims are estimates computed on an undiscounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims experience adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. The ultimate liability may vary significantly from such estimates. We regularly adjust these estimates as new claims experience emerges and reflect the changes in operating results in the year such adjustments are made.
Income Taxes: Income tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing our income tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse.
Derivatives: We have limited activity with derivative financial instruments. We do not use them for trading purposes, nor do we engage in leveraged derivative transactions. At December31, 2006, our only outstanding derivative contracts were interest rate swaps related to our 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes and cross-currency swaps related to our $450 million senior notes (see Notes 4 and 7).
We document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objectives for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. We also assess, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives and nonderivatives used in hedging activities are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values of the hedged items. The assessment of hedge effectiveness determines the noncash accounting treatment of changes in fair value.
We have designated our cross-currency swaps as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of our investment in Aflac Japan. We include the fair value of the cross-currency swaps in either other assets or other liabilities on the balance sheet. We report the changes in fair value of the foreign currency portion of our cross-currency swaps in other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate component are reflected in other income in the consolidated statements of earnings.
We have designated our interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability of the interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. We include the fair value of the interest rate swaps in either other assets or other liabilities on the balance sheet. We report the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps in other comprehensive income as long as they are deemed effective. Should any portion of the swap be deemed ineffective, that value would be reported in other income in the consolidated statements of earnings.
Policyholder Protection Fund and State Guaranty Association Assessments: In Japan, the government has required the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder protection fund. We recognize a charge for our estimated share of the industrys obligation once it is determinable. We review the estimated liability for policyholder protection fund contributions on an annual basis and report any adjustments in Aflac Japans expenses.
II- 52 Table of Contents In the United States, each state has a guaranty association that supports insolvent insurers operating in those states. To date, our state guaranty association assessments have not been material.
Treasury Stock: Treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of shareholders equity at cost. We use the weighted-average purchase cost to determine the cost of treasury stock that is reissued. We include any gains and losses in additional paid-in capital when treasury stock is reissued.
Earnings Per Share: We compute basic earnings per share (EPS) by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of unrestricted shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period plus the shares representing the dilutive effect of share-based awards.
New Accounting Pronouncements: In September2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158). The provisions of SFAS 158 apply to all plan sponsors who offer defined benefit postretirement plans. SFAS 158 requires a plan sponsor to recognize the plans funded status as an asset or liability in its balance sheet, and to measure plan assets and liabilities as of the end of the sponsors fiscal year. It also requires an entity to recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. However, SFAS 158 does not change the amount of net periodic benefit cost, or expense, included in net earnings. The recognition and disclosure requirements of SFAS 158 are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December15, 2006. The measurement date provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2008. Earlier application of the measurement date provisions is encouraged. We adopted the recognition and measurement date provisions of this standard effective December31, 2006. The adoption of this standard increased our pension plans projected benefit obligation by $64 million; and resulted in a charge to other comprehensive income of $64 million before taxes to reflect the increase in pension liabilities and an opening adjustment to retained earnings in the amount of $2 million.
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This standard applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. Where applicable, this standard simplifies and codifies related guidance within GAAP. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, with earlier application encouraged under limited circumstances. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In June2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.109. The provisions of FIN 48 clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in II- 53 Table of Contents accordance with SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two-step process. Under the first step, the enterprise determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The second step is measurement, whereby a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006, with earlier application encouraged. We do not expect the adoption of this interpretation to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In February2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No.133 and 140 (SFAS 155). The provisions of SFAS 155 are effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of the first fiscal year after September15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted. SFAS 155 amends the accounting for hybrid financial instruments and eliminates the exclusion of beneficial interests in securitized financial assets from the guidance under SFAS 133. It also eliminates the prohibition on the type of derivative instruments that qualified special purpose entities may hold under SFAS 140. Furthermore, SFAS 155 clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives. In accordance with the standards early adoption provisions, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 155 on January1, 2006. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In November2005, the FASB issued Staff Position Number FAS 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments (FSP 115-1). FSP 115-1 addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. It also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in FSP 115-1 amends SFAS No.115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and became effective January1, 2006. The adoption of this staff position did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In September2005, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the AICPA issued Statement of Position (SOP) 05-1, Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts (SOP 05-1). SOP 05-1 provides accounting guidance on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in SFAS No.97, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments. SOP 05-1 is effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006, with earlier adoption encouraged. Retrospective application of this SOP to previously issued II- 54 Table of Contents financial statements is not permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.123 (revised), Share-Based Payment (SFAS123R). This standard amends SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supercedes APB Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS 123R establishes the accounting for grants of share-based awards in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or transactions that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. SFAS 123R requires that companies use a fair value method to value share-based awards and recognize the related compensation expense in net earnings. The provisions of SFAS 123R, as amended by the Securities and Exchange Commission, were effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year after June15, 2005, although earlier application was encouraged. In accordance with the standards early adoption provisions, we began accounting for share-based awards using the modified-retrospective application method effective January1, 2005.
Recent accounting pronouncements that were not discussed above are not applicable to our business.
Securities and Exchange Commission Guidance: In September2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108 (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements, specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. Under the provisions of SAB 108, a reporting entity must quantify and evaluate errors using a balance sheet approach and an income statement approach. After considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, if either approach results in a misstatement that is material, a reporting entitys financial statements must be adjusted. SAB 108 applies to SEC registrants and is effective for fiscal years ending after November15, 2006. In the course of evaluating balance sheet amounts in accordance with the provisions of SAB 108, we have identified the following amounts thatwe have adjusted for as of January1, 2006: a tax liability in the amount of $87 million related to deferred tax asset valuation allowances that were not utilized; a tax liability in the amount of $45million related to various provisions for taxes that were not utilized; and a litigation liability in the amount of $11 million related to provisions for various pending law suits that were not utilized. These liabilities were recorded in immaterial amounts prior to 2004 over a period ranging from 10 to 15years. However, using the dual evaluation approach prescribed by SAB 108, correction of the above amounts would be material to current year earnings. In accordance with the provisions of SAB108, the following amounts, net oftax where applicable, have been reflected as an opening adjustment to retained earnings as of January1, 2006: a reduction of tax liabilities in the amount of $132 million; a reduction of litigation reserves in the amount of $11 million; and a reduction in deferred tax assets in the amount of $4million. These three adjustments resulted in a net addition to retained earnings in the amount of $139 million.

BUSINESS SEGMENT AND FOREIGN INFORMATION The Company consists of two reportable insurance business segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S., both of which sell individual supplemental health and life insurance.
Operating business segments that are not individually reportable are included in the Other business segments category. We do not allocate corporate overhead expenses to business segments. We evaluate and manage our business segments using a financial performance measure called pretax operating earnings. Our definition of operating earnings excludes the following items from net earnings on an after-tax basis: realized investment gains/losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. We then exclude income taxes related to operations to arrive at pretax operating earnings.

II- 63 Table of Contents Privately issued securities held by Aflac Japan at amortized cost accounted for $31.3 billion, or 64.0%, of total debt securities at December31, 2006, compared with $27.9 billion, or 61.8%, of total debt securities at December31, 2005. Total privately issued securities, at amortized cost, accounted for $33.6 billion, or 68.8%, of our total debt securities as of December31, 2006, compared with $30.1billion, or 66.6%, at December31, 2005. Of the total privately issued securities, reverse-dual currency debt securities (principal payments in yen, interest payments in dollars) accounted for $9.7billion, or 28.9%, at amortized cost as of December31, 2006, compared with $8.9 billion, or 29.6%, at amortized cost as of December31, 2005.
At December31, 2006, we owned below-investment-grade debt securities in the amount of $1.3billion at amortized cost ($1.1 billion at fair value), or 2.6% of total debt securities, compared with $1.1billion at amortized cost ($886 million at fair value), or 2.3% of total debt securities a year ago. Each of the below-investment-grade securities was investment grade at the time of purchase and was subsequently downgraded by credit rating agencies. These securities are held in the available-for-sale portfolio.
As of December31, 2006, $91 million, at fair value, of Aflac Japans debt securities had been pledged to Japans policyholder protection fund. At December31, 2006, debt securities with a fair value of $13 million were on deposit with regulatory authorities in the United States and Japan. We retain ownership of all securities on deposit and receive the related investment income.
Information regarding realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments for the years ended December31 follows: (Inmillions) 2006 2005 2004 Realized   investment gains (losses) on securities: Debt securities: Available for sale: Gross gains from sales $ 67 $ 284 $ 36 Gross losses from sales (34 ) (22 ) (54 ) Net gains (losses) from redemptions 4 (1 ) 6 Total debt securities 37 261 (12 ) Equity securities: Gross gains from sales 43 1 1 Impairment losses (1 ) - (1 ) Total equity securities 42 1 - Total realized investment gains (losses) $ 79 $ 262 $ (12 ) Changes in   unrealized gains (losses): Debt securities: Available for sale $ (624 ) $ (697 ) $ 216 Transferred to held to maturity (52 ) (113 ) (64 ) Equity securities (45 ) 11 4 Change in unrealized gains (losses) $ (721 ) $ (799 ) $ 156 II- 64 Table of Contents In 2006, we realized pretax gains of $79 million (after-tax, $51 million, or $.10 per diluted share) primarily as a result of bond swaps and the liquidation of equity securities held by Aflac U.S. In 2005, we realized pretax gains of $262 million (after-tax, $167 million, or $.33 per diluted share) primarily as a result of bond swaps. We began our bond-swap program in the second half of 2005 and concluded it in the first half of 2006. These bond swaps took advantage of tax loss carryforwards and also resulted in an improvement in overall portfolio credit quality and investment income.
During 2004, we received an issuers offer to redeem certain available-for-sale yen-denominated debt securities held by the Company. We accepted the issuers offer of $205 million and recorded a pretax loss of $23 million. This investment loss and other investment gains and losses in the normal course of business decreased pretax earnings by $12 million (after-tax $5 million, or $.01 per diluted share).
Fair values of debt securities and privately issued equity securities were determined using quotations provided by outside securities pricing sources and/or compiled using data provided by external debt and equity market sources. The data used in estimating fair value include credit spreads of comparably credit-rated securities and market quotations of securities with similar maturity and call structure characteristics. Fair values are then computed using standard industry models that provide pricing data based on a wide variety of inputs as noted above. The fair values provided by outside sources are reviewed internally for reasonableness. If a fair value appears unreasonable, the inputs are re-examined and the value is confirmed or revised. The fair values for publicly traded equity securities were determined using market quotations from the public exchange markets where the securities are principally traded.
II- 65 Table of Contents The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of our investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December31, 2006.

The contractual cash flows of these investments are guaranteed by either the U.S. or Japanese government. Furthermore, the contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Because we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, we do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December31, 2006.
The unrealized losses on the other investment categories in the preceding table were caused by changes in interest rates, yen/dollar exchange rates, and/or increased credit spreads. For credit related declines in market value, we begin a more focused review of the related issuer including more significantly, issuer credit ratings, issuer financial statements and other available financial data, timeliness of payment and issuer competitive environment. From those reviews, we evaluate the issuer's continued ability to service our investment. If, based on our reviews, we determine that the issuer has the ability to continue to service our investment; we conclude that the investment is temporarily impaired. Because we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, we do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December31, 2006.
Included in the unrealized losses on Other corporate fixed-maturity securities is an unrealized loss of $56 million on Aflac Japans $201 million (24 billion yen) investment in Tollo Shipping Company S.A. Our investment is guaranteed by the issuers parent, Compaia Sudamericana de Vapores S.A. (CSAV). The decline in fair value of the security was primarily caused by two factors: depressed revenue due to competitive pricing pressures in the container shipping industry and weaker operating margins due to sharply increased fuel costs. The contractual terms of this investment do not permit the issuer or its parent to settle the security at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment, and give priority to repayment of our investment under certain circumstances. While CSAVs credit rating has decreased from BBB- to BB+ (S&P), we currently believe it is probable that we will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the investment. Therefore, it is expected that our investment would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Because we have the intent and ability to hold this investment until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, we do not consider it to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December31, 2006.
II-67 Table of Contents The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of our investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December31, 2005.

However, our strategy of developing and marketing riders to our older policies has helped offset the negative investment spread. In spite of the negative investment spreads, overall profit margins in Aflac Japans aggregate block of business are adequate because of profits that continue to emerge from changes in mix of business and favorable mortality, morbidity, and expenses.
The contractual maturities of our investments in fixed maturities at December31, 2006, were as follows: AflacJapan AflacU.S.

Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
We own subordinated perpetual debenture securities. These securities are subordinated to other debt obligations of the issuer, but rank higher than equity securities. Although these securities have no contractual maturity, the interest coupons that were fixed at issuance subsequently change to a floating short-term interest rate of 125 to 300 basis points above market rates, generally by the 25 th year after issuance, thereby creating an economic maturity date. The economic maturities of our investments in perpetual debentures at December31, 2006, were as follows: AflacJapan AflacU.S.

At December31, 2006, available-for-sale QSPEs totaled $2.3 billion at fair value ($2.3billion at amortized cost, or 4.7% of total debt securities), compared with $2.2 billion at fair value ($2.3 billion at amortized cost, or 5.0% of total debt securities) at December31, 2005. We have no equity interests in any of the QSPEs, nor do we have control over these entities. Therefore, our loss exposure is limited to the cost of our investment.
We also own yen-denominated investments in variable interest entities (VIEs) totaling $1.9 billion at fair value, ($2.0 billion at amortized cost, or 4.2% of total debt securities) at December31, 2006. We are the primary beneficiary of VIEs totaling $1.5 billion at fair value ($1.7 billion at amortized cost) II- 70 Table of Contents and have consolidated our interests in these VIEs in accordance with FASB Interpretation No.46 (revised December2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The activities of these VIEs are limited to holding debt securities and utilizing the cash flows from the debt securities to service our investments therein. The terms of the debt securities mirror the terms of the notes held by Aflac. The consolidation of these investments does not impact our financial position or results of operations. We also have interests in VIEs that we are not required to consolidate totaling $375 million at fair value ($373 million at amortized cost) as of December31, 2006. The loss on any of our VIE investments would be limited to its cost.
We lend fixed-maturity securities to financial institutions in short-term security lending transactions. These short-term security lending arrangements increase investment income with minimal risk. Our security lending policy requires that the fair value of the securities and/or cash received as collateral be 102% or more of the fair value of the loaned securities. At December31, 2006, we had security loans outstanding with a fair value of $780 million, and we held cash in the amount of $807 million as collateral for these loaned securities. At December31, 2005, we had security loans outstanding with a fair value of $605 million, and we held cash in the amount of $622 million as collateral for these loaned securities.
During 2006, we reclassified an investment from held to maturity to available for sale as a result of the issuers credit rating downgrade. At the date of transfer, this debt security had an amortized cost of $118 million.
During 2005, we reclassified an investment from held to maturity to available for sale as a result of the issuers credit rating downgrade. This debt security had an amortized cost of $254 million at the date of transfer.
During 2004, we reclassified two debt securities from held to maturity to available for sale. The first transfer resulted from the issuers credit rating downgrade. At the time of transfer, the debt security had an amortized cost of $118 million. Included in accumulated other comprehensive income immediately prior to the transfer was an unamortized gain of $24 million related to this security. This gain represented the remaining unamortized portion of a $32 million gain established in 2001, when we reclassified this investment from available for sale to held to maturity. The second transfer resulted from the deterioration in the issuers credit worthiness. At the time of transfer, this debt security had an amortized cost of $291 million.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The carrying values and estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments as of December31 were as follows: 2006 2005 (Inmillions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Assets: Fixed-maturity   securities $ 42,288 $ 42,174 $ 39,009 $ 38,981 Perpetual   debentures 8,398 8,432 8,542 8,622 Equity   securities 25 25 84 84 Liabilities: Notes   payable (excluding capitalized leases) 1,416 1,421 1,382 1,395 Cross-currency   and interest rate swaps 7 7 12 12 Obligation   to Japanese policyholder protectionfund 175 175 203 203 The methods of determining the fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities are described in Note 3. The fair values of notes payable with fixed interest rates were obtained from an independent financial information service. The fair values of our cross-currency swaps are the expected amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the swaps, taking into account current interest rates, foreign currency rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. The fair value of the Japanese policyholder protection fund is our estimated share of the industrys obligation calculated on a pro rata basis by projecting our percentage of the industrys premiums and reserves and applying that percentage to the total industry obligation payable in future years.
The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accrued investment income, accounts payable, cash collateral and payables for security transactions approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Consequently, such instruments are not included in the above table. The preceding table also excludes liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims as these liabilities are not financial instruments as defined by GAAP.
We have outstanding cross-currency swap agreements related to the $450 million senior notes (see Note 7). We have designated the foreign currency component of these cross-currency swaps as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of our investment in Aflac Japan. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the senior notes.
We entered into cross-currency swaps to minimize the impact of foreign currency translation on shareholders equity and to reduce interest expense by converting the dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes we issued into yen-denominated obligations. By entering into these cross-currency swaps, we have been able to reduce our interest rate from 6.5% in dollars to 1.67% in yen. See Note 1 for information on the accounting policy for cross-currency swaps.
II- 72 Table of Contents T he components of the fair value of the cross-currency swaps were reflected as an asset or (liability) in the balance sheet as of December31 as follows: (Inmillions) 2006 2005 Interest   rate component $ 6 $ 6 Foreign   currency component (17 ) (22 ) Accrued   interest component 4 4 Total fair value of cross-currency swaps $ (7 ) $ (12 ) The following is a reconciliation of the foreign currency component of the cross-currency swaps as included in accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended December31.

By entering into these contracts, we have been able to lock in the interest rate at 1.52% in yen. We have designated these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The swaps had no value at inception. Changes in the fair value of the swap contracts are recorded in other comprehensive income. The fair value of these swaps and related changes in fair value were immaterial during the year ended December31, 2006.
We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our cross-currency and interest rate swaps.

In September2006, the Parent Company issued three tranches of Uridashi notes totaling 45 billion yen. The first tranche totaled 15 billion yen and has a five-year maturity. The second tranche totaled II- 76 Table of Contents 10billion yen and has a 10-year maturity. The third tranche totaled 20 billion yen and has a five-year maturity and a variable interest coupon of six-month yen LIBOR plus a spread. We have entered into interest rate swaps related to the 20 billion yen variable interest rate notes (see Note 4). Each tranche of Uridashi notes pays interest semiannually, may only be redeemed pri or to maturity upon the occurrence of a tax event as specified in the respective bond agreement and is not available to U.S. persons.
If issued, the 55 billion yen of Uridashi notes remaining under the August2006 SRS will not be available to U.S. persons.
In 2001, 2002, and 2005, the Parent Company issued yen-denominated Samurai notes, each with five-year maturities. Each series of Samurai notes pays interest semiannually, may only be redeemed prior to maturity upon the occurrence of a tax event as specified in the respective bond agreement and is not available to U.S. persons. In June2006, we paid in full the .87% Samurai notes issued in 2001.
For our yen-denominated loans, the principal amount as stated in dollar terms will fluctuate from period to period due to changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. We have designated all of our yen-denominated notes payable as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of our investment in Aflac Japan. We have also designated the interest rate swaps on our variable interest rate Uridashi notes as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with these notes.
The SRS we filed with Japanese regulatory authorities in 2003 expired in December2005. As a result, the Parent Company filed a new SRS with Japanese regulatory authorities in February2006 to issue up to 100 billion yen of yen-denominated Samurai notes in Japan. If issued, these securities will not be available to U.S. persons.
In 1999, we issued $450 million of senior notes. These notes pay interest semiannually and are redeemable at our option at any time with a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. We have entered into cross-currency swaps related to these notes (see Note 4).
The aggregate contractual maturities of notes payable during each of the years after December31, 2006, are as follows: Capitalized Total Long-term Lease Notes (Inmillions) Debt Obligations Payable 2007 $252 $4 $256 2008 - 3 3 2009 450 2 452 2010 336 1 337 2011 294 - 294 Thereafter 84 - 84 Total $1,416 $10 $1,426 We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable at December31, 2006.

In prior years, we established valuation allowances primarily for alternative minimum tax credit and noninsurance loss carryforwards that exceeded projected future offsets. Under U.S. income tax rules, only 35% of noninsurance losses can be offset against life insurance taxable income each year.
We received regulatory approval for a change in the allocation of expenses under the management fee agreement between Aflac and the Parent Company in 2005. This enabled the Parent Company to fully utilize its tax-basis, non-life operating losses and therefore release the valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax assets, resulting in a benefit of $34 million ($.07 per diluted share) in 2005.
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 eliminated the 90% limitation on the utilization of foreign tax credits. As a result of this tax law change, we recognized a benefit of $128 million ($.25 per diluted share) for the release of the valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets.
II-80 Table of Contents During 2005, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets decreased by $34 million primarily due to utilization of non-life losses. For current U.S. income tax purposes, alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $80 million were available at December31, 2006.

Stock options to purchase approximately 1.8million shares, on a weighted-average basis, as of December31, 2006, were considered to be anti-dilutive and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, compared with 2.5million in 2005, and 1.1 million in 2004.
The weighted-average shares used in calculating earnings per share for the years ended December31 were as follows: (Inthousandsofshares) 2006 2005 2004 Average outstanding shares used for calculatingbasic EPS 495,614 500,939 507,333 Dilutive effect of share-based awards 6,213 6,765 9,088 Average outstanding shares used for calculatingdiluted EPS 501,827 507,704 516,421 II-81 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Program: In 2004, the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 30million shares of our common stock. In 2006, the board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional 30 million shares of our common stock. As of December31, 2006, approximately 37 million shares were available for purchase under our share repurchase programs.
Voting Rights: In accordance with the Parent Companys articles of incorporation, shares of common stock are generally entitled to one vote per share until they have been held by the same beneficial owner for a continuous period of 48 months, at which time they become entitled to 10 votes per share.

SHARE-BASED TRANSACTIONS The Company has two long-term incentive compensation plans. The first is a stock option plan, which allows grants for incentive stock options (ISOs) to employees and non-qualifying stock options (NQSOs) to employees and non-employee directors. The options have a term of 10 years and generally vest after three years. The strike price of options granted under this plan is equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock at the date of grant. At December31, 2006, approximately 26 thousand shares were available for future grants under this plan.
The second long-term incentive compensation plan allows awards to Company employees for ISOs, NQSOs, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights. Non-employee directors are eligible for grants of NQSOs, restricted stock, and stock appreciation rights. Generally, the awards vest based upon time-based conditions or time-and-performance-based conditions. Performance-based vesting conditions generally include the attainment of goals related to Company financial performance. As of December31, 2006, the only performance-based awards issued and outstanding were restricted stock awards. As of December31, 2006, approximately 24 million shares were available for future grants under this plan.
Share-based awards granted to U.S.-based grantees are settled upon exercise with authorized but unissued Company stock, while those issued to Japan-based grantees are settled upon exercise with treasury shares.
The following table presents the expense recognized as a result of applying the provisions of SFAS 123R for the periods ended December31.

Expected volatility is based on historical periods generally commensurate with the estimated term of options. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and termination patterns within the model. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise patterns are stratified and considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of our option model and represents the weighted-average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. We base the risk-free interest rate on the Treasury note rate with a term comparable to that of the estimated term of options. The weighted-average fair value of options at their grant date was $15.28 for 2006, compared with $13.40 in 2005 and $10.66 in2004.

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercisable at that same date was $317 million, with a weighted-average remaining term of 4.5 years. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the year ended December31, 2006, was $62 million, compared with $114 million in 2005 and $57 million in 2004. We received cash from the exercise of stock options in the amount of $38 million in 2006, compared with $49 million in 2005 and $32 million in 2004. The tax benefit realized as a result of stock option exercises was $19 million in 2006 and $37 million in 2005. Due to the effect of the valuation allowance in 2004, the tax benefit realized from stock option exercises was immaterial (see Note 8).

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS Our insurance subsidiary is required to report its results of operations and financial position to state insurance regulatory authorities on the basis of statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by such authorities.
As determined on a U.S. statutory accounting basis, Aflacs net income was $1.7 billion in 2006, $1.3 billion in 2005, and $1.2 billion in 2004. Capital and surplus was $4.2 billion at December31, 2006, and $3.7 billion at December31, 2005.
Net assets of the insurance subsidiaries aggregated $9.3 billion at December31, 2006, on a GAAP basis, compared with $8.9 billion a year ago. Aflac Japan accounted for $5.7 billion, or 62.0%, of these net assets, compared with $5.5 billion, or 61.4% at December31, 2005.
II- 85 Table of Contents Reconciliations of Aflacs net assets on a GAAP basis to capital and surplus determined on a U.S. statutory accounting basis as of December31 were as follows: (Inmillions) 2006 2005 Net assets on GAAP basis $ 9,266 $ 8,916 Adjustment of carrying values of investments (2,153 ) (2,825 ) Elimination of deferred policy acquisition costs (5,922 ) (5,499 ) Adjustment to policy liabilities 1,526 1,194 Adjustment to deferred income taxes 2,124 2,546 Other, net (655 ) (627 ) Capital and surplus on U.S. statutory   accounting basis $ 4,186 $ 3,705 Aflac Japan must report its results of operations and financial position to the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis as prescribed by the FSA. Capital and surplus (unaudited) of Aflac Japan, based on Japanese regulatory accounting practices, aggregated $2.6 billion at December31, 2006, and $2.8 billion at December31, 2005. Japanese regulatory accounting practices differ in many respects from U.S. GAAP. Under Japanese regulatory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are charged off immediately; deferred income tax liabilities are recognized on a different basis; policy benefit and claim reserving methods and assumptions are different; the carrying value of securities transferred to held to maturity is different; policyholder protection fund obligations are not accrued; and premium income is recognized on a cash basis.
The Parent Company depends on its subsidiaries for cash flow, primarily in the form of dividends and management fees. Consolidated retained earnings in the accompanying financial statements largely represent the undistributed earnings of our insurance subsidiary. Amounts available for dividends, management fees and other payments to the Parent Company by its insurance subsidiary may fluctuate due to different accounting methods required by regulatory authorities. These payments are also subject to various regulatory restrictions and approvals related to safeguarding the interests of insurance policyholders. Our insurance subsidiary must maintain adequate risk-based capital for U.S. regulatory authorities and our Japan branch must maintain adequate solvency margins for Japanese regulatory authorities. Additionally, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid to the Parent Company by Aflac without prior approval of Nebraskas director of insurance is the greater of the net gain from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. Dividends declared by Aflac during 2007 in excess of $1.6 billion would require such approval. Dividends declared by Aflac during 2006 were $665 million.
II- 86 Table of Contents A portion of Aflac Japan earnings, as determined on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis, can be repatriated each year to Aflac U.S. after complying with solvency margin provisions and satisfying various conditions imposed by Japanese regulatory authorities for protecting policyholders. Profit repatriations to the United States can fluctuate due to changes in the amounts of Japanese regulatory earnings. Among other items, factors affecting regulatory earnings include Japanese regulatory accounting practices and fluctuations in currency translation of Aflac Japans dollar-denominated investments and related investment income into yen. Profits repatriated by Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S. were as follows for the years ended December31: InDollars InYen (Inmillionsofdollarsandbillionsofyen) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Profit   repatriation $ 442 $ 374 $ 220 50.0 41.2 23.9 The 2004 profit repatriation was lower due to the impact on Japanese regulatory earnings from the realized investment loss on Parmalat in 2003 and our decision to leave capital in Japan in order to maintain a strong solvency margin.

BENEFIT PLANS Our basic employee defined-benefit pension plans cover substantially all of our full-time employees in the United States and Japan. At December31, 2006, other liabilities included a liability for both plans in the amount of $102 million, compared with $65 million a year ago. The increase in the pension liability is due principally to the adoption of SFAS 158. We plan to make contributions of $20 million to the U.S. plan and $13million to the Japanese plan in 2007 to continue to improve their funded status.
On December31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions and early adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires the recognition of the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of our benefit plans in our financial statements, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income at adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs or credits, as applicable, and the unrecognized transition asset remaining from the initial adoption of SFAS 87, all of which were previously netted against the plans funded status in the past under the provisions of SFAS 87. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost over future periods consistent with our historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts. Further, the components of the benefit obligations that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic pension cost in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. Those amounts will also be subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost as previously described. The adoption of SFAS 158 had no effect on our earnings for the year ended December31, 2006, or for any prior period presented, and it will not affect our operating results in future periods.
The incremental effects of adopting the provisions of SFAS 158 on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of shareholders equity and statements of comprehensive income at II- 87 Table of Contents December31, 2006 are presented in the following table. Had we not adopted SFAS 158 at December31, 2006, we would have recognized an additional minimum liability under the provisions of SFAS 87. The effect of recognizing the additional minimum liability is included in the table below in the column labeled Prior to Application of SFAS 158.

The Japanese pension plan previously used a measurement date of December31. The impact of adopting the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 for our other post employment benefit plans was negligible.

During 2006, $2 million of actuarial loss was amortized to expense for the Japanese plan, while $3 million was amortized to expense for the U.S. plan.
No prior service costs or credits arose during 2006 and the amounts of prior service costs and credits amortized to expense were immaterial for the year ended December31, 2006. Amortization of actuarial losses to expense in 2007 is estimated to be $2 million for the Japanese plan and $4 million for the U.S. plan, while the amortization of prior service cost and credit is expected to be negligible.

Target asset allocations for U.S. plan assets are 55% to 60% equity securities, II- 89 Table of Contents 35% to 40% fixed-income securities and 1% to 3% cash and cash equivalents. Target asset allocations for Japanese plan assets are 34% equity securities and 66% fixed-income securities. As discussed below, the investment strategy of our pension plans is long-term in nature. Cash and cash equivalents exceeded the target allocations for the U.S. plan in 2005 primarily as a result of third quarter employer contributions of $20 million in 2005.
The investment objective of our U.S. and Japanese plans is to preserve the purchasing power of the plans assets and earn a reasonable inflation adjusted rate of return over the long term. Furthermore, we seek to accomplish these objectives in a manner that allows for the adequate funding of plan benefits and expenses. In order to achieve these objectives, our goal is to maintain a conservative, well-diversified and balanced portfolio of high-quality equity, fixed-income and money market securities. As a part of our strategy, we have established strict policies covering quality, type and concentration of investment securities. For our U.S. plan, these policies prohibit investments in precious metals, limited partnerships, venture capital, and direct investments in real estate. We are also prohibited from trading on margin. For our Japanese plan, these policies include limitations on investments in derivatives including futures, options and swaps, and low-liquidity investments such as real estate, venture capital investments, and privately issued securities.
We monitor the U.S. plans performance over a three- to five-year period utilizing shorter time frame performance measures to identify trends. We review investment performance and compliance with stated investment policies and practices on a quarterly basis. The specific investment objectives for the U.S. pension plan are: to exceed a composite of asset class target returns, weighted according to the plans target asset allocation; and to outperform the median fund from a universe of similarly managed corporate pension funds. Both objectives are measured over a rolling five-year period. We monitor the Japanese plans performance and compliance with stated investment policies and practices on a quarterly basis.
Expected future benefit payments for the U.S. and Japanese plans are as follows: (Inmillions) Japan U.S.

The corporate portion, which the Company still maintains, is based on a plan established by Aflac Japan. The substitutional portion was transferred back to the Japanese government in 2004. In connection with the transfer, we recognized a pretax gain of $6 million (after-tax, $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2004.

We base the long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets on the historical rates of return over the last 15 years and the expectation of similar returns over the long-term investment goals and objectives of U.S. plan assets. We base the long-term rate of return on the Japanese plan assets on the historical rates of return over the last 10 years.
In addition to the benefit obligations for funded employee plans, we also maintain unfunded supplemental retirement plans for certain officers and beneficiaries. Retirement expense for these unfunded supplemental plans was $16 million in 2006, $20 million in 2005, and $32 million in 2004. The accrued retirement liability for the unfunded supplemental retirement plans was $209 million at December31, 2006, compared with $203 million a year ago. The assumptions used in the valuation of these plans were the same as for the funded plans.
Stock Bonus Plan: Aflac U.S. maintains a stock bonus plan for eligible U.S. sales associates.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES We have entered into two outsourcing agreements with IBM. The first agreement provides mainframe computer operations and support for Aflac Japan. It began in 2006 and has a remaining term of nine years and an aggregate remaining cost of 26.0 billion yen ($218 million using the December31, 2006, exchange rate). The second agreement provides computer server operations and support for Aflac Japan.

We lease office space and equipment under various agreements that expire in various years through 2021.

We are a defendant in various lawsuits considered to be in the normal course of business. Senior legal and financial management review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. The final results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. Although some of this litigation is pending in states where large punitive damages bearing little relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs have been awarded in recent years, we believe the outcome of pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules13a-15(e)and 15d-15(e)under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report (the Evaluation Date). Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (a) Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under this framework, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2006.
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
(b) Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The shareholders and board of directors of Aflac Incorporated: We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting , that Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of II-96 Table of Contents Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) .
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended II-97 Table of Contents December31, 2006, and our report dated February27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements, with an explanatory paragraph as the Company adopted the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans , an amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 88, 106 and 132(R), in 2006.
Atlanta, Georgia February27, 2007 (c) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting.
There have not been any changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules13a-15(f)and 15d-15(f)under the Exchange Act) during the last fiscal quarter of 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

*Management contract or compensatory plan or agreement IV-4 Table of Contents FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES The shareholders and board of directors of Aflac Incorporated: Under date of February27, 2007, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of Aflac Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December31, 2006, and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2006, which are included herein.
