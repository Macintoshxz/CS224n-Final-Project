Exhibits       andFinancial Statement Schedules 15 Signatures 26 Index       to Exhibits 27 Part I Item 1.Business We are one of the nations leading diversified health care benefits companies, serving approximately 36.5 million people with information and resources to help them make better informed decisions about their health care.We offer a broad range of traditional and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental, behavioral health, group life and disability plans, and medical management capabilities and health care management services for Medicaid plans.Our customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates.
We are dedicated to helping people achieve health and financial security by providing easy access to safe, cost-effective, quality health care and protecting their finances against health-related risks.
We seek to achieve superior customer satisfaction through innovative products, comprehensive health and related benefits choices, effective service and easy-to-understand information.
The health insurance and related benefits industry continues to experience significant change.
Employers, consumers and the federal and state governments have increased their focus on health care costs and providing health insurance to the uninsured, and continue to drive changes in the structure of health insurance and related benefits products and services.Product features continue to evolve that are directed at containing rising health care costs, addressing affordability problems, enhancing access to quality health care services and giving members greater control and responsibility in directing their benefit dollars.For employer-based health coverage, employers are continuing to require covered employee members to assume a greater portion of the cost of their health care and/or coverage.These economic factors and greater consumer awareness are leading to increased popularity of products that offer flexibility in design features such as deductibles and co-payments, health savings accounts, consumer access to a broader network of health care providers and quality-based physician networks.The industry is also subject to other forces including adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, federal and state legislative and regulatory reforms, advances in pharmaceutical and medical technology and industry consolidation.All of these factors can affect the competitiveness of product and service offerings, the range of industry competitors and the bases of competition.
We believe that these factors will exist for some time and will drive a continuing evolution in the health insurance and related benefits industry.We place significant emphasis on developing and maintaining our product and service offerings to serve existing and new customer markets and have done so through organic growth and acquisitions.Over the last five years, this focus has led to the introduction of new products, such as our Personal Health Record, which provides members with online access to personal information to help them make better informed decisions about their health care; Aetna Health Connections, SM our integrated disease management program; Medicare Part D prescription drug plans and private fee-for-service Medicare plans (PFFS).We continue to develop and enhance our existing products, such as our Aexcel SM physician networks, which are comprised of specialist providers who have demonstrated effectiveness in the delivery of care based on measures of clinical performance and efficiency.In addition, during 2008 we began offering disease management services to international members.We are also continuing to expand our initiative to improve the transparency of our products and pricing by utilizing our Aetna Navigator on-line tool to give our members access to physician-specific cost, clinical quality and efficiency information in additional select markets.
Page 1 During 2008, our emphasis on introducing, developing and enhancing new products and services through organic growth led to the expansion and diversification of both the geographic scope of our operations and the customer markets we serve.Our significant expansions and diversifications during 2008 included:  expanding       our individual and small group marketing into additional       states;  expanding       our capabilities to serve Government and labor   customers;  expanding       our Medicaid offerings to a total of 11 states;  expanding       our capabilities to serve retirees, particularly through our relationship       with the HR Policy Association and our enhanced individual and group       Medicare offerings; and  expanding       our expatriate offerings and global   capabilities.
As we enhance our product capabilities and geographic presence, we continually evaluate acquisitions and other transactions that present strategic growth opportunities.
Our operations are conducted in three business segments: Health Care, Group Insurance and Large Case Pensions.
We derive our revenues primarily from insurance premiums, administrative fees, investments and other revenue.Refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on pages2 and 79, respectively, of the Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference, regarding revenue, profit and total asset information for each of our business segments.The following is a description of each of our business segments.
Health Care Products and Services Health Care products consist of medical, pharmacy benefits management, dental, behavioral health and vision plans offered on both an insured basis and an employer-funded, or administrative,basis.Medical products include point of service (POS), preferred provider organization (PPO), health maintenance organization (HMO) and indemnity benefit (Indemnity) plans.Medical products also include health savings accounts (HSAs) and Aetna HealthFund  , consumer-directed health plans that combine traditional POS or PPO and/or dental coverage, subject to a deductible, with an accumulating benefit account.We also offer Medicare and Medicaid products and services and specialty products, such as medical management and data analytics services, medical stop loss insurance, as well as products that provide access to our provider networks in select markets.We refer to insurance products as Insured and administrative products as ASC.
Our principal products and services are targeted specifically to large multi-site national, mid-sized and small employers.We also serve individual insureds, expatriates and, in certain markets, Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.Medicare and Medicaid products and services are categorized separately from our other Health Care products and services, which we refer to as Commercial.
The primary Commercial products we offer are POS, PPO, HMO and Indemnity plans.We also offer other products and services.Our other Commercial products and services include: ActiveHealth Management Through the use of our patented CareEngine  system, our ActiveHealth Management business provides evidence-based medical management and data analytics products and services to a broad range of customers, including health plans, employers and others.
Personal Health Record Our Personal Health Record provides members with online access to personal information, including individual personalized messages and alerts, detailed health history based on available claims data and voluntarily submitted information and integrated information and resources to help members make informed decisions about their health care.
Page 2 Pharmacy We offer pharmacy benefit management and specialty and mail order pharmacy services to our members.Our pharmacy fulfillment services are delivered by Aetna Specialty Pharmacy (ASP) and Aetna Rx Home Delivery  .ASP compounds and dispenses specialty medications and offers certain support services associated with specialty medications.Specialty medications are generally injectable or infused medications that may not be readily available at local pharmacies.Aetna Rx Home Delivery  provides mail order prescription drug services.
Dental We offer managed dental plans on an Insured and ASC basis.We are one of the nations largest providers of dental coverage, based on membership at December 31, 2008.
Behavioral Health Our behavioral health products provide members who experience mental health issues with integrated behavioral health benefit administration, access to a network of providers and innovative wellness programs.
Cofinity Cofinity provides access to a regional health care provider network to other insurance companies, third party administrators, health plans and employers.It has operations in Michigan, Colorado and other states.
Stop Loss We offer stop loss insurance coverage for certain employers.Under this product, we assume the costs associated with large individual claims and/or aggregate loss experience within the employers plan above a pre-set annual threshold.
Other Commercial Products and Services We offer a variety of other health care coverage products either as supplements to health products or as stand-alone products.Such products, which may be offered on an Insured or an ASC basis, include indemnity and vision programs.We also offer, directly or in cooperation with third parties, our Aetna Health Connections SM disease management program, which addresses 30 chronic conditions, including asthma, diabetes, congestive heart failure and lower back pain.
In addition to Commercial health products, in select markets we also offer HMO, PPO, PFFS and prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries and participate in Medicaid and subsidized State Childrens Health Insurance Programs (SCHIP).SCHIP are state-subsidized insurance programs that provide benefits for families with uninsured children.Our Medicare and Medicaid products include: Medicare Through annual contracts with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), we offer HMO and PPO plans for eligible individuals in certain geographic areas through the Medicare Advantage program.Members typically receive enhanced benefits over standard Medicare fee-for-service coverage, including reduced cost-sharing for preventive care, vision and other services.As a result of the changes in Medicare resulting from the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, we continue to expand our Medicare Advantage program into select markets.We offered these plans in 214 counties in 18 states and Washington, D.C. in 2008 and are expanding to 224 counties in 19 states and Washington, D.C. in 2009.
We are a national provider of the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program (PDP) in all 50 states to both individuals and employer groups.All Medicare eligible individuals are eligible to participate in this voluntary prescription drug plan.Members typically receive coverage for certain prescription drugs, usually subject to a deductible, co-insurance and/or co-payment.
Page 3 We offer PFFS in select markets for individuals and nationally for employer groups.When combined with our PDP product, PFFS forms an integrated national fully insured Medicare product for employers that provides medical and pharmacy benefits.
Medicaid and SCHIP We offer healthcare management services for eligible Medicaid and SCHIP individuals under multi-year contracts which are subject to annual appropriations.We offered these services on an Insured basis in five states, ASC basis in four states and targeted medical management services in five states in 2008.
Provider Networks We contract with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers for services for our customers.The health care providers who participate in our networks are independent contractors and are neither our employees nor our agents, except for providers who work in our mail-order and specialty pharmacy facilities.
We use a variety of techniques designed to help encourage appropriate utilization of health care resources and maintain affordability of quality coverage.In addition to contracts with health care providers for negotiated rates of reimbursement, these techniques include the development and implementation of guidelines for the appropriate utilization of health care resources and the provision of data to providers to enable them to improve health care quality.
At December 31, 2008, we had extensive nationwide provider networks of more than 894,000 participating health care providers, including over 517,000 primary care and specialist physicians and over 5,000 hospitals.
PCPs We compensate primary care physicians (PCPs) on both a fee-for-service and capitated basis, with capitation generally limited to HMO products in certain geographic areas.In a fee-for-service arrangement, network physicians are paid for health care services provided to the member based upon a set fee for the services provided.Under a capitation arrangement, physicians receive a monthly fixed fee for each member, regardless of the medical services provided to the member.During 2008, we continued to eliminate or reduce the use of capitation arrangements in many areas.The percentage of health care costs related to capitation arrangements was 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 5.5% and 5.9% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Specialist Physicians Specialist physicians participating in our networks are generally reimbursed at contracted rates per visit or per procedure.
Hospitals We typically enter into contracts with hospitals that provide for per day and/or per case rates, often with fixed rates for ambulatory, surgery and emergency room services.We also have hospital contracts that provide for reimbursement based on a percentage of the charges billed by the hospital.
Our medical plans generally require notification of elective hospital admissions, and we monitor the length of hospital stays.Physicians who participate in our networks generally admit their patients in network based products to participating hospitals using referral procedures that direct the hospital to contact our patient management unit in order to confirm the patients membership status and facilitate the patient management process.This unit also assists members and providers with related activities, including, if necessary, the subsequent transition to the home environment and home care.Case management assistance for complex cases is provided by a special case unit.
Other Providers Laboratory, imaging, urgent care and other freestanding health facility providers are generally paid under fee-for-service arrangements, except for certain laboratory services.
Page 4 Quality Assessment We seek accreditation for most of our HMO plans from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), a national organization established to review the quality and medical management systems of health care plans.Health care plans seeking accreditation must pass a rigorous, comprehensive review and must annually report on their performance.As of December 31, 2008, approximately 98% of our HMO members participated in HMOs that had received accreditation by the NCQA.
Aetna Life Insurance Company (ALIC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aetna, has received NCQA PPO Full Accreditation through December 11, 2010.
We also seek accreditation and certification for other products from NCQA and URAC, another national organization founded to establish standards for the health care industry.Purchasers and consumers look to URACs and NCQAs accreditation and certification as an indication that a health care organization has the necessary structures and processes to promote high quality care and preserve patient rights.In addition, regulators in over half of the states recognize URACs or NCQAs accreditation and certification standards.
Our provider selection and credentialing/recredentialing policies and procedures are consistent with NCQA and URAC, as well as state and federal requirements.In addition, we are certified under the NCQA Credentials Verification Organization (CVO) certification program for all certification options through January 29, 2011.Our URAC CVO accreditation is valid through October 1, 2009.
Our quality assessment programs for contracted providers who participate in our networks begin with the initial review of health care practitioners.Practitioners licenses and education are verified, and their work history is collected by us or in some cases by the practitioners affiliated group or organization.Our credentialing and recredentialing practices are in accordance with applicable URAC and NCQA requirements and state and federal regulations.We generally require participating hospitals to be certified by CMS or accredited by the Joint Commission or the American Osteopathic Association.
We also offer quality and outcome measurement programs, quality improvement programs and health care data analysis systems to providers and purchasers of health care services.
Principal Markets and Sales Our medical membership generally is dispersed throughout the United States, although we serve a limited number of members in countries outside the United States.Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page79 of the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference, for additional information on our foreign customers.We offer a broad range of traditional and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, many of which are available nationwide.Depending on the product, we market to a range of customers including employer groups (small, mid-sized and large multi-site national accounts), individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates.

We market both Insured and ASC products and services primarily to employers that sponsor our products (also called plan sponsors) for the benefit of their employees and their employees dependents.Frequently, larger employers offer employees a choice among coverage options, from which the employee makes his or her selection during a designated annual open enrollment period.Typically, employers pay all of the monthly premiums to us and, through payroll deductions, obtain reimbursement from employees for a percentage of the premiums that is determined by each employer.Some Health Care products are sold on a fully employee-paid basis.In some cases, we bill the covered individual directly.We also sell Insured plans directly to individual consumers in a number of states.
We sell Insured Medicare coverage on an individual basis as well as through employer groups to their retirees.Medicaid and SCHIP members are enrolled on an individual basis.
Health Care products are sold through our sales personnel, as well as through independent brokers, agents and consultants who assist in the production and servicing of business.For large plan sponsors, independent consultants and brokers are frequently involved in employer health plan selection decisions and sales.We pay commissions, fees and other amounts to brokers, agents, consultants and sales representatives who place business with us.We support our marketing and sales efforts with an advertising program that may include television, radio, billboards and print media, supplemented by market research and direct marketing efforts.
Pricing For Commercial Insured plans, employer group contracts containing the pricing and other terms of the relationship are generally established in advance of the policy period, typically for a duration of one year.We use prospective rating methodologies in determining the premium rates charged to the majority of employer groups, and we also use retrospective rating methodologies for some groups.Premium rates for customers with more than approximately 125 employees generally take into consideration the individual plan sponsors historical and anticipated claim experience where permitted by law.Some states may prohibit the use of one or more of these rating methods for some customers, such as small employer groups, or all customers.
Under prospective rating, a fixed premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period.We typically cannot recover unanticipated increases in medical costs in the current policy period; however, we may consider prior experience for a product in the aggregate or for a specific customer, among other factors, in determining premium rates for future policy periods.Where required by state laws, premium rates are filed and approved prior to contract inception.Our future results could be adversely affected if the premium rates we request are not approved or are adjusted downward by state regulators.
Under retrospective rating, we determine a premium rate at the beginning of the policy period.After the policy period has ended, the actual claim and cost experience is reviewed.If the actual claim costs and other expenses are less than expected, we may issue a refund to the plan sponsor based on this favorable experience.If the experience is unfavorable, we may, in certain instances, recover the resulting deficit through contractual provisions or consider the deficit in setting future premium levels.Generally, we may not recover the deficit if a plan sponsor elects to terminate coverage.Retrospective rating may be used for Commercial Insured plans that cover more than approximately 300 lives.
We have Medicare Advantage and PDP contracts with CMS to provide HMO, PPO, PFFS and prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries in certain geographic areas.Under these annual contracts, CMS pays us a fixed capitation payment and/or a portion of the premium, both of which are based on membership and adjusted for demographic and health risk factors.CMS also considers inflation, changes in utilization patterns and average per capita fee-for-service Medicare costs in the calculation of the fixed capitation payment or premium.Our PDP contracts also provide a risk sharing arrangement with CMS to limit our exposure/benefit to unfavorable or favorable expenses.Amounts payable under the Medicare arrangements are subject to annual revision by CMS, and we elect to participate in each Medicare service area or region on an annual basis.In addition to payments received from CMS, most of our Medicare Advantage products and all of our PDP products require a supplemental premium to be paid by the member or sponsoring employer.In some cases these supplemental premiums are adjusted based on the members income and asset levels.Compared to Commercial products, Medicare contracts generate higher per member per month revenues and medical expenses.
Page 6 Under our Insured Medicaid contracts with states, government agencies pay us fixed monthly rates per member that vary by state, line of business and demographics, and we arrange, pay for and manage health care services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries.These rates are subject to change by each state, and in some instances, provide for adjustment for health risk factors.CMS requires these rates to be actuarially sound.We also receive fees from our customers where we provide services under ASC Medicaid contracts.Our ASC Medicaid contracts generally are for periods of more than one year, and certain of them contain guarantees with respect to certain medical, financial and operational metrics, as well as certain performance guarantees regarding reduction of the claim expenses incurred under state government contracts.Under these guarantees, we are financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met.Payments to us under each of these Medicaid contracts are subject to the annual appropriation process in the applicable state.
We offer HMO, consumer directed and dental plans to federal employees under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program.Premium rates for those plans are subject to federal government review and audit, which can result and have resulted in retroactive and prospective premium adjustments.
Our ASC plans are generally for a period of one year.Some of our ASC contracts include performance guarantees ranging generally from one to three years with respect to certain functions such as customer service response time, claim processing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain performance guarantees that claim expenses to be incurred by plan sponsors will fall within a specified range.Under these guarantees, we are financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk is generally 20% - 30% of fees paid by the customer involved.
Competition The health care industry is highly competitive, primarily due to a large number of competitors, our competitors marketing and pricing, and a proliferation of competing products, including new products that are continually being introduced into the market.New entrants into the marketplace as well as significant consolidation within the industry have contributed to the competitive environment.
We believe that the significant factors that distinguish competing health plans are perceived overall quality (including accreditation status), quality of service, comprehensiveness of coverage, cost (including both premium and member out-of-pocket costs), product design, financial stability, geographic scope of provider networks, providers available in such networks, and quality of member support and care management programs.We believe that we are competitive on each of these factors.Our ability to increase the number of persons covered by our plans or to increase our revenues is affected by our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors on these factors.In addition, our ability to increase the number of persons enrolled in our Insured products is affected by the desire and ability of employers to self fund their health coverage.Competition may also affect the availability of services from health care providers, including primary care physicians, specialists and hospitals.
In addition to competitive pressures affecting our ability to obtain new customers or retain existing customers, our membership can be affected by reductions in workforce by existing customers due to soft economic conditions, especially in the geographies where our membership is concentrated.
Our Insured products compete with local and regional health care benefits plans, in addition to health care benefits and other plans sponsored by other large commercial health benefit insurance companies and Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans.Additional competitors include other types of medical and dental provider organizations, various specialty service providers (including pharmacy benefit providers), integrated health care delivery organizations, and, for certain plans, programs sponsored by the federal or state governments.
Our ASC plans compete primarily with other large commercial health benefit insurance companies, Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans and third party administrators.
Factors Affecting Forward-Looking Information Information regarding certain important factors that may materially affect Health Cares business and our statements concerning future events is included in the Outlook for 2009 and Forward-Looking Information/Risk Factors sections of the MD&A, beginning on pages3 and32 of the Annual Report, respectively, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Page 7 Group Insurance Principal Products Group Insurance products consist primarily of the following:  Life Insurance Products consist principally of group term life insurance coverage, the       amounts of which may be fixed or linked to individual employee wage       levels.We also offer voluntary spouse and dependent term       life coverage, and group universal life and accidental death and       dismemberment coverage.We offer life products on an Insured       basis.
Disability Insurance Products provide employee income replacement benefits for both short-term       and long-term disability.We also offer disability products       with additional case management features.Similar to Health       Care products, we offer disability benefits on both an Insured and       employer-funded basis.We also provide absence management       services, including short-term and long-term disability administration and       leave management, to employers.
Long-Term Care Insurance       Products provide benefits to cover the cost of care in private home       settings, adult day care, assisted living or nursing       facilities.Long-term care benefits were offered primarily on       an Insured basis.The product was available on both a service       reimbursement and disability basis.We no longer solicit or       accept new long-term care customers, and we are working with our customers       on an orderly transition of this product to other   carriers.
Principal Markets and Sales We offer our Group Insurance products in 49 states as well as Washington, D.C., Guam, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands and Canada.Depending on the product, we market to a range of customers from small employer groups to large, multi-site and/or multi-state employer programs.
We market Group Insurance products and services primarily to employers that sponsor our products for the benefit of their employees and their employees dependents.Frequently, employers offer employees a choice of benefits, from which the employee makes his or her selection during a designated annual open enrollment period.Typically, employers pay all of the monthly premiums to us and, through payroll deductions, obtain reimbursement from employees for a percentage of the premiums that is determined by each employer.Some Group Insurance products are sold directly to employees of employer groups on a fully employee-paid basis.In some cases, we bill the covered individual directly.
Group Insurance products are sold through our sales personnel, as well as through independent brokers, agents and consultants who assist in the production and servicing of business.For large plan sponsors, independent consultants and brokers are frequently involved in employer plan selection decisions and sales.We pay commissions, fees and other amounts to brokers, agents, consultants and sales representatives who place business with us.We support our marketing and sales efforts with an advertising program that may include television, radio, billboards and print media, supplemented by market research and direct marketing efforts.
Pricing For Insured Group Insurance plans, employer group contracts containing the pricing and other terms of the relationship are generally established in advance of the policy period.We use prospective and retrospective rating methodologies to determine the premium rates charged to employer groups.These are typically offered with rate guarantees that generally range from one to three years.
Under prospective rating, a fixed premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period.We cannot recover unanticipated increases in mortality or morbidity costs in the current policy period; however, we may consider prior experience for a product in the aggregate or for a specific customer, among other factors, in determining premium rates for future policy periods.
Page 8 Under retrospective rating, we determine a premium rate at the beginning of the policy period.After the policy period has ended, the actual claim and cost experience is reviewed.If the experience is favorable (i.e., actual claim costs and other expenses are less than expected), we may issue a refund to the plan sponsor.If the experience is unfavorable, we consider the deficit in setting future premium levels, and in certain instances, we may recover the deficit through contractual provisions such as offsets against refund credits that develop for future policy periods.However, we may not recover the deficit if a plan sponsor elects to terminate coverage.Retrospective rating is most often used for Insured employer funded plans that cover more than 3,000 lives and pay more than $500,000 in annual premiums.
Competition For the group insurance industry, we believe that the significant factors that distinguish competing companies are cost, quality of service, financial strength of the insurer, comprehensiveness of coverage, and product array and design.We believe we are competitive on each of these factors.The group life and group disability markets remain highly competitive.
Reinsurance We currently haveseveral reinsurance agreements with nonaffiliated insurers that relate to both group life and long-term disability products. Most reinsurance arrangements are established on a case by case basis and a subset of our reinsurance agreements cover closed blocks of business and cancelled cases.We also have reinsurance that provides a limited degree of catastrophic risk protection for certain of our life products.We frequently evaluate reinsurance opportunities and refine our reinsurance and risk management strategies on a regular basis.
