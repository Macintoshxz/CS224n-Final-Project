Table of Contents PART I Item 1.
Business This combined Annual Report on Form10-K is separately filed by Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision") and CSC Holdings, LLC, formerly CSC Holdings, Inc. ("CSC Holdings" and collectively with Cablevision, the "Company" or the "Registrants").
Cablevision Systems Corporation Cablevision is a Delaware corporation which was organized in 1997.Cablevision owns all of the outstanding membership interests in CSC Holdings and its liabilities include approximately $2.2billion of senior notes which amount does not include approximately $754million of its senior notes held by Newsday Holdings LLC, its 97.2% owned subsidiary.The $754million of notes are eliminated in Cablevision's consolidated financial statements and are shown as notes due from Cablevision in total member's deficiency of CSC Holdings.Cablevision has no operations independent of its CSC Holdings subsidiary.
CSC Holdings CSC Holdings is one of the largest cable operators in the United States based on the number of video subscribers.As of December31, 2011, we served approximately 3.25million video customers in and around the New York metropolitan area and in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah.We believe that our cable television systems in the New York metropolitan area comprise the largest metropolitan cluster of cable television systems under common ownership in the United States (measured by number of video subscribers).We also provide high-speed data and Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") services using our cable television broadband network.Through Cablevision Lightpath, Inc. ("Optimum Lightpath"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, we provide telephone services and high-speed Internet access to the business market.In addition, we own approximately 97.2% of Newsday LLC which operates a newspaper publishing business.We also own regional news and high school sports programming services, a motion picture theatre business and a cable television advertising sales business.
We classify our operations into two reportable segments: Telecommunications Services and Other.Our Telecommunications Services segment includes our cable television business, including our video, high-speed data, and VoIP operations and the operations of the commercial data and voice services provided by Optimum Lightpath.It also includes the operations of our cable television systems in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, which were acquired in December 2010.Our Other segment includes the operations of (i)Newsday, which includes the Newsday daily newspaper, amNew York, Star Community Publishing Group, and online websites including newsday.com and exploreLI.com, (ii)our motion picture theatre business ("Clearview Cinemas"), (iii)the News12 Networks, our regional news programming services, (iv)the MSG Varsity network, our network dedicated entirely to showcasing high school sports and activities, (v)our cable television advertising company, Cablevision Media Sales Corporation ("Cablevision Media Sales"), previously known as Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation and (vi)certain other businesses and unallocated corporate costs.Refer to Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our segments.
(1) Table of Contents AMC Networks Inc. Distribution On June30, 2011, Cablevision distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of AMC Networks Inc. ("AMC Networks"), a company which consists principally of national programming networks, including AMC, WE tv, IFC and Sundance Channel, previously owned and operated by the Company's Rainbow segment (the "AMC Networks Distribution").The AMC Networks Distribution took the form of a distribution by Cablevision of one share of AMC Networks ClassA Common Stock for every four shares of Cablevision NY Group ("CNYG") ClassA Common Stock and one share of AMC Networks ClassB Common Stock for every four shares of CNYG ClassB Common Stock.As a result of the AMC Networks Distribution, we no longer consolidate the financial results of AMC Networks for the purpose of our own financial reporting and the historical financial results of AMC Networks have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the AMC Networks Distribution date.
Acquisition of Bresnan Cable On December14, 2010, the Company, through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, consummated the acquisition of Bresnan Broadband Holdings, LLC ("Bresnan Cable").The purchase price was approximately $1.36billion.The acquisition was financed using an equity contribution to the acquisition subsidiaries by CSC Holdings of $395million, which CSC Holdings borrowed under its revolving loan facility, and debt incurred by the acquisition subsidiaries consisting of an undrawn $75million revolving loan facility, a $765million term loan facility and $250million 8.0% senior notes due 2018.
MSG Distribution On February9, 2010, Cablevision distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of The Madison Square Garden Company ("Madison Square Garden"), a company which owns the sports, entertainment and certain media businesses previously owned and operated by the Company's Madison Square Garden segment (the "MSG Distribution").The MSG Distribution took the form of a distribution by Cablevision of one share of Madison Square Garden ClassA Common Stock for every four shares of CNYG ClassA Common Stock and one share of Madison Square Garden ClassB Common Stock for every four shares of CNYG ClassB Common Stock.As a result of the MSG Distribution, we no longer consolidate the financial results of Madison Square Garden for the purpose of our own financial reporting and the historical financial results of Madison Square Garden have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the MSG Distribution date.
Telecommunications Services General Cable television is a service that delivers multiple channels of video programming to subscribers who pay a monthly fee for the services they receive.Video signals are received over-the-air, by fiber optic transport or via satellite delivery by antennas, microwave relay stations and satellite earth stations and are modulated, amplified and distributed over a network of coaxial and fiber optic cable to the subscribers' television sets.Cable television systems typically are constructed and operated pursuant to non-exclusive franchises awarded by local and state governmental authorities for specified periods of time.
Our cable television systems offer varying packages of video service.In our New York metropolitan service area, the video service is marketed under the Optimum and iO brand names.Our cable television systems in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah (the "Optimum West service area") use the Optimum brand name to market our video product offerings.Our video services may include, among other programming, local broadcast network affiliates and independent television stations, certain other news, information and entertainment channels such as CNN, AMC, CNBC, ESPN, MTV, and regional sports networks such as MSG Network, and certain premium services such as HBO, Showtime, The Movie Channel, Starz!/Encore and Cinemax.We also offer digital video service, which enables customers to receive video on demand and subscription video on demand services, as well as additional viewing channels.
(2) Table of Contents Our cable television revenues are derived principally from monthly fees paid by subscribers.In addition to recurring subscriber revenues, we derive revenues from the sales of pay-per-view movies and events, video on demand and subscription video on demand program services, from the sale of advertising time on advertiser supported programming and from installation and equipment charges.Certain services and equipment provided by substantially all of our cable television systems are subject to regulation.See "Regulation - Cable Television." We also provide high-speed data services using our cable television broadband network.High-speed data services are provided to residential and small business customers through a cable modem device.The high-speed data service is marketed as "Optimum Online".
We offer VoIP technology services exclusively to our residential and small business Optimum Online customers, marketed as "Optimum Voice".
Through Optimum Lightpath, a business broadband service provider, we provide telecommunications services to the business market in the greater New York metropolitan area.Optimum Lightpath provides converged data, Internet and voice solutions to mid-sized and large businesses, hospital systems, municipalities, and school systems.As of December31, 2011, Optimum Lightpath had over 5,000 buildings connected to its fiber network.Optimum Lightpath has built an advanced fiber optic network extending more than 4,800 route miles, which includes approximately 263,000 miles of fiber, throughout the New York metropolitan area.Optimum Business Services provides similar products in our Optimum West service area.
(3) Table of Contents The following table sets forth certain statistical data regarding our video, high-speed data and VoIP operations,excluding Optimum Lightpath, as of the dates indicated: As of December31, New York Metropolitan Service Area 2011 Optimum West Service Area 2011(1) Total 2011 New York Metropolitan Service Area 2010 Optimum West Service Area 2010(1) Total 2010 Total 2009 (in thousands, except per subscriber amounts) Total customers (2) 3,255 356 3,611 3,298 350 3,648 3,314 Video customers (3) 2,947 303 3,250 3,008 306 3,314 3,063 High-speed data customers 2,701 264 2,965 2,653 239 2,892 2,568 Voice customers 2,201 156 2,357 2,138 131 2,269 2,052 Serviceable passings (4) 4,922 662 5,584 4,882 650 5,532 4,829 Penetration: Total customers to serviceable passings 66.1 % 53.7 % 64.7 % 67.6 % 53.8 % 65.9 % 68.6 % Video customers to serviceable passings 59.9 % 45.7 % 58.2 % 61.6 % 47.1 % 59.9 % 63.4 % High-speed data customers to serviceable passings 54.9 % 39.9 % 53.1 % 54.3 % 36.8 % 52.3 % 53.2 % Voice customers to serviceable passings 44.7 % 23.5 % 42.2 % 43.8 % 20.2 % 41.0 % 42.5 % Average Monthly Revenue per Video Customer ("RPS") (5) $ 156.09 $ 134.60 $ 154.10 $ 150.68 (6) N/A N/A $ 144.03 (6) ______________ N/A Not meaningful.
(1) Reflects data related to Bresnan Cable, which was acquired by the Company on December14, 2010.
(2) Represents number of households/businesses that receive at least one of the Company's services.
(3) Video customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets.In calculating the number of customers, we count all customers other than inactive/disconnected customers.Free accounts are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group such as our current and retired employees.Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services.Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion.We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual room units at that hotel.In counting bulk residential customers, such as an apartment building, we count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer.
(4) Represents the estimated number of single residence homes, apartment and condominium units and commercial establishments passed by the cable distribution network in areas serviceable without further extending the transmission lines, including our Optimum Lightpath customers.
(5) RPS is calculated by dividing the average monthly U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") revenues for the Telecommunications Services segment, less the revenue attributable to Optimum Lightpath, for the fourth quarter of each year presented by the average number of video customers served by our cable television systems for the same period.For purposes of this calculation, both revenue and average number of video customers exclude our Optimum Lightpath operations because Optimum Lightpath's third-party revenues are unrelated to our cable television system customers.
(6) Represents data for the New York metropolitan service area.
Subscriber Rates and Services; Marketing and Sales Video Services Our cable television systems offer a government mandated broadcast basic level of service which generally includes local over-the-air broadcast stations, such as network affiliates (e.g., ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX), and public, educational or governmental channels.
All of our cable television systems also offer an expanded basic package of services, generally marketed as "Family Cable", which includes, among other programming, news, information, entertainment, and sports channels such as CNN, CNBC, Discovery, ESPN, AMC, the Disney Channel, and regional sports networks such as MSG Network.For additional charges, our cable television systems provide premium services such as HBO, Showtime, The Movie Channel, Starz!/Encore and Cinemax, which may be purchased either individually or in tiers.
(4) Table of Contents Our digital video programming services currently offered to subscribers, branded iO TV in our New York metropolitan service area and Optimum TV in our Bresnan service area, include:  Up to 535 standard definition and high definition ("HD") entertainment channels,  Over 80 premium movie channels including multiplexes of HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, Starz!/Encore and The Movie Channel,  Access to thousands of on-demand titles each month, including hit movies (most available in HD), classic, independent and international films, subscription on-demand services and free on-demand offerings,  46 channels of uninterrupted commercial-free digital music from Music Choice,  Seasonal sports packages from the National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, college football and basketball, plus sports and entertainment packages with over 30 channels,  Up to 86 international channels from around the world,  Up to 134 channels available in HD, including local broadcast affiliates, local sports channels, premium networks such as HBO and various other cable networks,  A collection of enhanced television applications including News12 Interactive, Newsday TV, Optimum Autos and Homes, MSG Interactive, iO Games, and MSG Varsity, all in our New York metropolitan service area,  Digital video recorder ("DVR") service, giving subscribers the ability to record, pause and rewind live television, and  DVR Plus, a remote-storage DVR available in almost half of our New York metropolitan service area, giving subscribers the ability to record and play television programming from any room in the home.
In 2011, in our New York metropolitan service area, we began offering a free Optimum App for the iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone, which allows our cable television customers to experience iO TV digital service, including access to hundreds of channels and on demand titles, on their device in the home.The Optimum App delivers the full cable television experience to the devices and allows them to function as a television.
Packaging of our video product includes options with programming to suit the needs of our individual customers.Offers include various levels of programming including premium channels, news, sports, children's, general entertainment, international channels and digital music at various price points.
Since our network serving our existing cable television systems has been upgraded to provide advanced digital video services, our sales and marketing efforts are primarily directed toward retaining our existing customers and increasing our penetration to homes passed for all of our existing services.We market our cable television services through in-person selling, as well as telemarketing, direct mail advertising, promotional campaigns and local media and newspaper advertising.
Optimum Online Optimum Online is our high-speed Internet access offering, which connects customers to the Internet using the same network that delivers our cable television service.

We have deployed a broadband wireless network ("WiFi") in commercial and high traffic locations across our New York metropolitan service area as a free value-added benefit to Optimum Online customers.The WiFi feature, which is delivered via wireless access points mounted on our cable television broadband network, allows Optimum Online customers to access the service while they are away from their home or office.WiFi has been activated across our Long Island, Bronx, Brooklyn, New Jersey, Westchester, and Connecticut service areas.
Optimum Online service includes access to complimentary features such as web and mobile access to DVR for iO TV in our New York metropolitan service area, giving users the ability to remotely schedule and manage recordings as well as internet security software, including anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal firewall, and anti-spam protection.Our Optimum Online Boost Plus and Optimum Online Ultra levels also include web hosting, additional storage, and other features.

(6) Table of Contents Bundled Offers We offer several promotional packages with discounted pricing to existing and new customers who subscribe to one or more of our products as compared to the lacarte prices for each individual product.We also offer other pricing discounts for certain products that are added to existing services.For example, we offer an "Optimum Triple Play" package that is a special promotion for new customers or eligible current customers where our three products, video, high-speed data and voice, are each available for a flat fee per month, generally $29.95, for a year, when purchased together.For a total additional fee of $9.95 per month, the Ultimate Triple Play, available in our New York metropolitan service area, includes Optimum Online Boost Plus and a free router for new customers.We have from time to time also offered promotional and other pricing discounts as part of our competitive strategy.
Subscribers to all three of our service offerings who are not on a promotional pricing plan are eligible for "Optimum Rewards", which provides subscribers with a monthly discount on their bill, exclusive discounts and offers for shopping, dining, movie tickets and other benefits.
System Capacity Our cable plant network in the New York metropolitan service area uses state of the art technology including fiber optic cable.The network is a minimum of 750MHz two-way interactive system offering a combination of analog and digital channels, high-speed data and voice services.Our cable plant network in the Optimum West service area is on a state of the art hybrid fiber coaxial platform of which 90% of the plant is two-way with a minimum of 750 MHz capacity.
Programming Adequate programming is available to the cable television systems from a variety of sources.Program suppliers' compensation is typically a fixed, per subscriber monthly fee (subject to contractual escalations) based, in most cases, either on the total number of video subscribers of the cable television systems, or on the number of subscribers subscribing to the particular service.The programming contracts are generally for a fixed period of time and are subject to negotiated renewal.Cable programming costs have increased in recent years and are expected to continue to increase due to additional programming being provided to most subscribers, increased costs to produce or purchase cable programming and other factors.
Franchises Our cable television systems are operated in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah under non-exclusive franchise agreements, where required by the franchising authority, with state and/or municipal or county franchising authorities.Although the terms of franchise agreements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, they typically require payment of franchise fees and contain regulatory provisions addressing, among other things, upgrades, service quality, cable service to schools and other public institutions, insurance and indemnity bonds.The terms and conditions of cable franchises vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.Franchise authorities generally charge a franchise fee of not more than 5% of certain of our cable service revenues that are derived from the operation of the system within such locality.We generally pass the franchise fee on to our subscribers.
Franchise agreements are usually for a term of 5 to 15years from the date of grant; most are 10years.Franchises usually are terminable only if the cable operator fails to comply with material provisions, and then only after complying with substantive and procedural protections afforded by the franchise and federal and state law.As of December31, 2011, our ten largest franchise areas comprised approximately 44% of our total video customers and of those, two franchises comprising approximately 110,000 video customers, are expired.We are currently operating in these franchise areas under temporary authority.
The Company has never lost a franchise for an area in which it operates.When a franchise agreement reaches expiration, a franchising authority may seek to impose new requirements, including requirements to upgrade facilities, to increase channel capacity and to provide additional support for local public, education and government access programming.Negotiations can be protracted, and franchise agreements sometimes expire before a renewal is negotiated and finalized.New York and New Jersey state laws provide that pre-existing franchise terms continue in force during the renewal negotiations until agreement is reached or one or both parties seek to pursue "formal" franchise remedies under federal law.In Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, the Company's right to operate following the expiration of a franchise for franchises still in renewal negotiations is protected by federal law and/or the consent of the municipality.In approximately 40 municipalities in Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado, the Company operates its cable television systems without a franchise, pursuant to Section621(b)(2) of the Federal Cable Act, which provides that no franchise is required in communities where the cable operator or its predecessor lawfully provided service as of July1, 1984 and the municipality has not requested a franchise.Federal law provides significant substantive and procedural protections for cable operators seeking renewal of their franchises.See "Regulation - Cable Television."Despite the Company's efforts and the protections of federal law, it is possible that one or more of the Company's franchises may be subject to termination or non-renewal or we may be required to make significant additional investments in response to requirements imposed in the course of the franchise renewal process.
(7) Table of Contents Optimum Lightpath holds a franchise from New York City which grants rights of way authority to provide telecommunications services throughout the five boroughs.The franchise expired on December20, 2008 and renewal discussions with New York City are ongoing.We believe we will be able to obtain renewal of the franchise and have received assurance from New York City that the expiration date of the franchise is being treated as extended until a formal determination on renewal is made.Failure to ultimately obtain renewal of the franchise could negatively affect Optimum Lightpath's revenues.

(8) Table of Contents MSG Varsity MSG Varsity is a network dedicated entirely to showcasing high school sports and activities.This suite-of-services enables students to share their stories through a combination of television and interactive platforms.One of the many compelling components of this programming service is the involvement of high schools throughout our footprint as co-producers of MSG Varsity's content, in addition to content created by our professional productions.We have a licensing arrangement with Madison Square Garden permitting us to use "MSG Varsity" as the name of this programming service.MSG Varsity is available to all subscribers throughout our footprint in the New York metropolitan service area.

Cablevision Media Sales Corporation Cablevision Media Sales Corporation, previously known as Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation, is a cable television advertising company that sells local and regional commercial advertising time on cable television networks and offers advertisers the opportunity to target specific geographic and demographic audiences.
Investment in Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") Common Stock We own 21,477,618 shares of Comcast common stock acquired in connection with the sale of certain cable television systems in prior years.All of these shares have been monetized pursuant to collateralized prepaid forward contracts.See "Item7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for a discussion of our monetization contracts.
Competition Cable Television Our cable television systems operate in an intensely competitive environment, competing with a variety of other video programming providers and delivery systems, including incumbent telephone companies, satellite-delivered signals, internet-based programming and broadcast television signals available to homes within our market by over-the-air reception.
Incumbent Telephone Companies.
We face intense competition in the New York metropolitan service area from two incumbent telephone companies.Verizon Communications, Inc. ("Verizon") and AT&T Inc. ("AT&T"), which offer video programming in addition to their voice and high-speed Internet access services to residential customers in this service area, compete across all of our telecommunications products.Verizon has made and may continue to make promotional offers to customers in our New York metropolitan service area at prices lower than ours.The attractive demographics of our service territory make this region a desirable location for investment in video distribution technologies by these companies.Verizon has constructed fiber to the home network plant that passes a significant number of households in our New York metropolitan service area (while difficult to assess, our estimates indicate that Verizon passes more than 45% of these households, based on currently available information).Verizon has obtained authority to provide video service for a majority of these homes passed, on a statewide basis in New Jersey, in numerous local franchises in New York State, including all of New York City, and in a small portion of Connecticut.AT&T offers video service in competition with us in most of our Connecticut service area.This competition impacts our video revenue in these areas and may continue to do so in the future.See "Regulation" for a discussion of regulatory and legislative issues.Verizon and AT&T also market direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") services in our New York metropolitan service area.Each of these companies has significantly greater financial resources than we do.
(9) Table of Contents DBS.
We also face competition from DBS service providers in our New York metropolitan service area and in our Optimum West service area.The two major DBS services, DISH Network and DirecTV, are available to the vast majority of our customers.These services each offer over 300 channels of programming, including programming that is substantially similar to the programming that we offer, at competitive prices.Our ability to compete with these DBS services is affected by the quality and quantity of programming available to us and to them.DirecTV has exclusive arrangements with the National Football League that gives it access to programming that we cannot offer.
Other Competitors and Video Programming Sources.
Another source of competition for c able television systems is the delivery of video content over the Internet directly to subscribers.
In addition, consumers are able to watch such Internet-delivered content on Internet-ready television sets and mobile devices.Cable television systems also face competition from broadcast television stations, entities that make digital video recorded movies and programs available for home rental or sale, satellite master antenna television ("SMATV") systems, which generally serve large multiple dwelling units under an agreement with the landlord andservice providers that utilize the public rights-of-way and operate an "open video system" ("OVS").RCN Corporation ("RCN") is authorized to operate OVS systems that compete with us in New York City.The FCC also has made radio spectrum available for the provision of multichannel video service.
There can be no assurance that these or other existing, proposed, or as yet undeveloped technologies will not become dominant in the future and render our cable television systems less profitable or even obsolete.
High-Speed Data Our high-speed data offering in our New York metropolitan service area faces intense competition from other providers of high-speed Internet access, including Verizon and AT&T.Our high-speed data offering in our Optimum West service area, also branded Optimum Online, faces competition from CenturyLink, Inc. ("CenturyLink").In addition, DBS providers have tested the use of certain spectrum to offer satellite-based high-speed data services.Cellular phone providers are also increasing the speeds of their Internet access offerings, and the FCC has made other radio spectrum available for wireless high-speed Internet access.
VoIP Our VoIP service in our New York metropolitan service area faces intense competition from other providers of voice services, including carriers such as Verizon and AT&T.Our VoIP service in our Optimum West service area, also branded Optimum Voice, faces competition from other carriers, such as CenturyLink.We must also negotiate interconnection agreements with these carriers.Our VoIP services also face competition from other competitive providers of voice services, including wireless voice providers, as well as VoIP providers like Vonage that do not own networks but can provide service to any person with a broadband connection.
(10) Table of Contents Optimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLECs Optimum Lightpath operates in the most competitive business telecommunications market in the country and competes against the very largest telecommunications companies - incumbent local exchange carriers ("ILECs"), other competitive local exchange companies ("CLECs") and long distance companies.More specifically, Optimum Lightpath faces substantial competition from Verizon and AT&T, which are the dominant providers of local telephone and broadband services in their respective service areas.We also operate CLECs in each state within the Optimum West service area (the "Bresnan CLECs"), which compete against ILECs and Century Link.ILECs have significant advantages over Optimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLECs, including greater capital resources, an existing fully operational local network, and long-standing relationships with customers.
While Optimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLECs compete with the ILECs they also enter into interconnection agreements with ILECs so that their customers can make and receive calls to and from customers served by the ILECs and other telecommunications providers.Federal and state law and regulations require ILECs to enter into such agreements and provide such facilities and services, at prices subject to regulation.The specific price, terms and conditions of each agreement, however, depend on the outcome of negotiations between Optimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLECs with each ILEC.Agreements are also subject to approval by the state regulatory commissions.Optimum Lightpath has entered into interconnection agreements with Verizon for New York, New Jersey and portions of Connecticut and with AT&T for portions of Connecticut, which have been approved by the respective state commissions.Optimum Lightpath also entered into interconnection agreements with regional carriers in New York and New Jersey.The Bresnan CLECs also have interconnection agreements in their service areas.These agreements, like all interconnection agreements, are for limited terms and are required to be renegotiated, arbitrated and approved subject to the laws in effect at that time.
Optimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLECs also face competition from one or more competitive access providers and other new entrants in the local telecommunications and data marketplace, and competitive local exchange carriers.In addition to the ILECs and other CLECs, other potential competitors capable of offering voice and broadband services include electric utilities, long distance carriers, microwave carriers, wireless telephone system operators (such as cellular, PCS, and specialized mobile radio), and private networks built by large end users.A continuing trend toward business combinations and alliances in the telecommunications industry may create stronger competition for Optimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLECs.
Newsday Newsday operates in a highly competitive market, which may adversely affect advertising and circulation revenues.Newsday faces significant competition for advertising revenue from a variety of media sources.The most direct source of competition is other newspapers that reach a similar audience in the same geographic area.Newsday also faces competition from magazines, shopping guides, yellow pages, websites, mobile-device platforms, broadcast and cable television, radio and direct marketing; particularly if those media sources provide advertising services that could substitute for those provided by Newsday within the same geographic area.Specialized websites for real estate, automobile and help wanted advertising have become increasingly competitive with our newspapers and websites for classified advertising and further development of additional targeted websites is likely.
Newsday and the newspaper industry generally have experienced significant declines in advertising and circulation revenue as circulation and readership levels continue to be adversely affected by competition from new media news formats and less reliance on newspapers by some consumers, particularly younger consumers, as a source of news and classifieds.A prolonged decline in circulation levels would also have a material adverse effect on the rate and volume of advertising revenues.
(11) Table of Contents Clearview Cinemas Clearview Cinemas, as a smaller regional film exhibitor, competes with a number of large theatre chains and independent theatres with respect to acquiring licenses to films and attracting patrons.The principal competitive factors in obtaining films from distributors include licensing terms, seating capacity, location, prestige of the theatre chain and of the particular theatre, and quality of projection and sound equipment.Most of our competitors are in a stronger competitive position than Clearview Cinemas based upon these factors.We believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting film audiences are the availability of marketable films, the location of theatres, theatre comfort and environment, projection and sound quality, 3D capability, level of service and ticket price.The theatre exhibition industry also faces competition from other motion picture exhibition delivery systems, such as network, syndicated, on-demand and pay television; DVD, and other home video systems; DVD by mail services such as Netflix and Red Box and the availability of films over the Internet.
Regulation Cable Television Our cable television systems are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations.Our systems are regulated under congressionally imposed uniform national guidelines, first set forth in the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 and amended by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (collectively, the "Federal Cable Act"), as well as under other provisions of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended.The Federal Cable Act, Federal Communications Act, and the regulations and policies of the FCC affect significant aspects of the Company's cable system operations The following paragraphs describe the existing legal and regulatory requirements that are most significant to our business today.
Franchising .The Federal Cable Act requires cable operators to obtain a franchise in order to provide cable service.Regulatory responsibility for awarding franchises rests with state and local franchising authorities.Federal law prohibits our franchising authorities from granting an exclusive cable franchise to us, and they cannot unreasonably refuse to award an additional franchise to compete with us.In the states in which the Company operates, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have enacted comprehensive cable regulation statutes that are applicable to cable operators and other providers of video service, such as Verizon and AT&T; however, all of the states in which we operate have consumer protectionlaws that apply to us.Although the terms of franchise agreements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, they typically require payment of franchise fees and contain regulatory provisions addressing, among other things, upgrades, service quality, cable service to schools and other public institutions, insurance and indemnity bonds.State and local franchising authority, however, must be exercised consistently with the Federal Cable Act, which sets limits on franchising authorities' powers.It restricts franchising authorities from imposing franchise fees greater than 5% of gross revenues from the provision of cable television service, prohibits franchising authorities from requiring us to carry specific programming services, and protects us in seeking franchise renewals by limiting the factors a franchising authority may consider and requiring a due process hearing before denial of renewal.
Pricing and Packaging.
The Federal Cable Act and the FCC's rules regulate the rates that cable operators may charge for basic video service, equipment and installation.None of these rules applies to cable systems that the FCC determines are subject to effective competition, or where franchising authorities have chosen not to regulate rates.For our New York metropolitan service area cable television systems, the FCC has made "effective competition" findings in the majority of our communities covering substantially all of our customer base.For our Optimum West service area cable television systems, we have obtained such a ruling covering over 80% of our customer base.
(12) Table of Contents In addition, in areas not subject to effective competition, the Federal Cable Act and the FCC's rules also require us to establish a "basic service" package consisting, at a minimum, of all local broadcast signals that we carry, as well as, if the locality requests, all public, educational and governmental access programming carried by our systems.All subscribers are required to purchase this tier as a condition of gaining access to any other programming that we provide.From time to time, Congress or the FCC consider imposing new pricing or packaging regulations, including proposals requiring cable operators to offer programming services on an unbundled basis rather than as part of a tier or to provide a greater array of tiers to give subscribers the option of purchasing a more limited number of programming services.
Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent.
Cable operators are required by the "must carry" provisions of federal law to carry, without compensation, the programming transmitted by most local broadcast stations.Additionally, FCC rules require that we simulcast must-carry stations in analog as long as we carry any programming in analog on our system.Those rules expire on June12, 2012 unless extended.
Alternatively, local television stations may elect retransmission consent.Stations making such an election give up their must-carry right and negotiate with cable systems the terms on which the cable systems carry their stations.Cable systems generally may not carry a broadcast station that has elected retransmission consent without the station's consent.The terms of retransmission consent agreements frequently include the payment of compensation to the station.A substantial number of local broadcast stations currently carried by our cable television systems have elected to negotiate for retransmission consent.While we currently have retransmission consent agreements with all such broadcast stations, the potential remains for carriage of such stations to be discontinued if any of such agreements is not renewed following its expiration.
In the wake of publicized disputes between several cable operators and broadcasters, several members of Congress have expressed concern that current retransmission consent requirements and practices have had a negative effect on consumers, and stated that it is time for Congress to reexamine those requirements.Other members of Congress have suggested that binding arbitration may be an appropriate means of resolving such disputes.The FCC has initiated a proceeding to consider changes to its rules governing retransmission consent negotiations.
Ownership Limitations.
Congress has required the FCC to set a national limit on the number of subscribers a cable company can serve, and a limit on the number of channels on a cable television system that can be occupied by video programming services in which the operator of that system has an attributable interest.The FCC established a national limit of 30% on the number of multichannel video households that a single cable operator can serve, but that limit was invalidated by a federal court in August 2009 and the FCC has not yet established a new limit.The FCC also created a limit of 40% on the number of channels on a cable television system that can be occupied by video programming services in which the operator of that system has an attributable interest, but that rule was invalidated by a federal court in 2001 and the FCC has not yet established a new limit.
Set Top Boxes.
The FCC requires cable operators to allow consumers to connect televisions and other consumer electronics equipment with a slot for a security card directly to digital cable television systems to enable receipt of one-way digital programming without need for a set-top box.The FCC also requires cable operators to separate security from non-security functions in new digital set-top boxes deployed on or after July1, 2007, to permit the manufacture and sale of these devices by third parties.We meet this requirement by providing set top boxes with separable security.Additionally, the FCC has an ongoing proceeding to examine whether it should take further steps to promote a retail market for cable service navigation devices, including requirements to facilitate access to Internet-based video offerings via subscribers' television sets, which may entail further mandates in connection with the support and deployment of set top boxes.
PEG and Leased Access.
Localities may require free access to public, educational or governmental ("PEG") channels on our systems.In addition to providing PEG channels, we must make a limited number of commercial leased access channels available to third parties (including parties with potentially competitive video services) at regulated rates.The FCC established a new formula for calculation of the price we can charge for the use of leased access channels that could effectively require us to make at least some leased access channels available at no charge, and established additional leased access customer service standards and procedures for addressing complaints regarding alleged violations of the leased access rules, but these rules were stayed by a federal court and were also rejected by the Office of Management and Budget.The FCC is deciding what action to take with regard to the challenged rules.
(13) Table of Contents Pole Attachments.
The FCC has authority to regulate utility company rates for the rental of pole and conduit space used by companies, including cable operators, to provide cable, telecommunications services, and Internet access services, unless states establish their own regulations in this area.With the exception of Wyoming, Montana and Colorado, the states in which we operate have adopted such regulations.Utilities must provide nondiscriminatory access to any pole, conduit or rights-of-way controlled by the utility.The FCC held that the pole attachment rate for commingled services (e.g., cable and Internet access) cannot exceed the rate it has established for telecommunications attachments.
Program Access .In 1992, Congress enacted the "program access" provisions of the Federal Cable Act.These provisions prohibit cable operators from entering into exclusive distribution contracts for satellite-delivered video programming services in which a cable operator holds an attributable interest, such as AMC Networks' services, unless the FCC first approves the exclusive arrangement.This prohibition expires in October 2012, unless extended by the FCC.In 2007, the FCC sought public comment on a proposal to allow a cable operator to petition for repeal of the exclusivity ban prior to 2012 with respect to programming it owns, in markets where the cable operator faces competition from other video distributors.The FCC has taken no action on this proposal.The program access rules also prohibit a cable operator from unduly or improperly influencing the decision of an affiliated satellite-delivered programmer to sell to an unaffiliated distributor and bar the programmer from discriminating in the prices, terms, and conditions of sale of a programming service.
The FCC adopted an order extending the program access rules to terrestrially-delivered programming created by cable operator-affiliated programmers when a showing can be made that the lack of such programming significantly hinders or prevents the distributor from providing satellite cable programming.The new rules authorize the FCC to compel the licensing of such programming in response to a complaint by a multichannel video programming distributor.Applying these rules in response to complaints by AT&T and Verizon brought against us and Madison Square Garden, the FCC in November 2011 ordered Madison Square Garden to license Verizon and AT&T the terrestrially-delivered HD programming of the MSG networks.
Program Carriage.
The FCC's program carriage rules govern disputes between cable operators and unaffiliated programming services over the terms of carriage.We may not require an unaffiliated programming service to grant us a financial interest or exclusive carriage rights as a condition of its carriage on our cable television systems, and we may not discriminate against such programming services in the terms and conditions of carriage on the basis of their affiliation or nonaffiliation with us.
In August 2011, the FCC adopted changes to its program carriage rules, which govern disputes between programmers and multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") over carriage terms.The new rules, among other things, clarify what is required for a programmer to establish a prima facie case under the program carriage rules, permit a programmer that is seeking a renewal of a carriage agreement with a MVPD and who brings a complaint under the program carriage rules relating to such renewal to seek a temporary standstill requiring the MVPD to continue carrying the programming network during the pendency of the complaint, and clarify a number of procedural issues.The new rules have been challenged in federal court.In addition, the FCC sought formal comment on proposals for additional changes to its program carriage rules, including a proposal to require programmers and MVPDs to enter into "last best offer" style arbitration when they cannot reach agreement over carriage terms, to expand the scope of the discrimination provision to preclude a vertically-integrated MVPD from discriminating on the basis of a programming vendor's affiliation with another MVPD, and a proposal to allow the FCC to require MVPDs that are found to violate the program carriage rules to pay damages to complainants.On October12, 2011, Game Show Network ("GSN") filed a program carriage complaint against the Company, alleging that the Company discriminated against it in the terms and conditions of carriage based on GSN's lack of affiliation with the Company.The Company believes GSN's claims are without merit and is defending itself vigorously.
(14) Table of Contents Exclusive Access to Multitenant Buildings.
The FCC has prohibited cable operators from entering into or enforcing agreements with owners of multitenant buildings under which the operator is the only MVPD with access to the building.The FCC is considering whether to extend these prohibitions to exclusive marketing and bulk sales arrangements.
Privacy .In the course of providing service, we collect certain information about our subscribers and their use of our services.Our collection and use of personally identifiable information about our subscribers is subject to a variety of Federal and state privacy requirements, including those imposed specifically on cable operators by the Federal Cable Act.The Communications Act sets limits, subject to certain exceptions, on our disclosure of that information to third parties.As cable operators provide interactive and other advanced services, additional privacy considerations may arise. Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, and the U.S. Department of Commerce are all considering whether to adopt regulations that would govern the collection, use, and disclosure of subscriber information in connection with the delivery of advertising to consumers that is customized to their interests.These efforts are currently focused on the privacy implications of online advertising.
Federal Copyright Regulation.
We are required to pay copyright royalty fees to receive a statutory compulsory license to carry broadcast television signals.The U.S. Copyright Office has increased our royalty fees from time to time and has, at times, recommended to Congress changes in or elimination of the statutory compulsory licenses for cable television carriage of broadcast signals.Such changes, if made, could adversely affect the ability of our cable television systems to obtain such programming, and could increase the cost of such programming.
Access for Persons with Disabilities.
The 21 st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (the "Accessibility Act") gives the FCC the authority to adopt rules aimed at ensuring that persons with disabilities can more fully access the programming we carry.Pursuant to the Accessibility Act, in August 2011, the FCC reimposed video description requirements on some networks we carry and required cable operators to pass through such video description to subscribers.
Other Regulation.
We are subject to various other regulations, including those related to political broadcasting; home wiring; the blackout of certain network, sports and syndicated programming; prohibitions on transmitting obscene programming; limitations on advertising in children's programming; and standards for emergency alerts.The FCC also imposes various technical standards on our operations, including barring cable operators from encrypting service carried on the basic tier, but it is considering amending the ban on encryption to permit encryption in cable systems that have gone all-digital ( i.e.
, those that have eliminated analog service).
High-Speed Data Regulatory Classification.
Broadband Internet access services are classified by the FCC as "information services" for regulatory purposes.The FCC has traditionally subjected information services to a lesser degree of regulation than "telecommunications services," which are offered to the public for a fee on a common carrier basis.Some parties have asked the FCC to reverse this determination and classify broadband Internet access services as "telecommunications services."The FCC thus far has declined to do so.If the FCC changes the classification of these services, our high speed data service could be subject to substantially greater regulation.
(15) Table of Contents Access Obligations and "Net Neutrality." In December 2010, the FCC adopted a net neutrality framework applicable to broadband Internet access service that prohibits wireline broadband providers from blocking lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices, subject to reasonable network management as defined by the rules; bars such providers from unreasonably discriminating in transmitting lawful network traffic over a consumer's broadband Internet access service; and requires them to disclose information about their broadband Internet access service and their network management practices.These rules went into effect in November 2011.The rules have been challenged in federal court.Some parties have advocated that the FCC also require broadband providers to make transmission capacity available to third parties on a resale basis, but the FCC thus far has declined to do so.
Access For Persons With Disabilities.
The Accessibility Act expanded requirements for broadband Internet access services by ensuring that persons with disabilities have access to "advanced communications services" ("ACS"), such as electronic messaging and interoperable video conferencing, and extended closed captioning requirements to IP-enabled video services.Pursuant to the Accessibility Act, in October 2011, the FCC adopted regulations governing advanced communications services, and in January 2012, the FCC adopted rules requiring that video programming delivered via Internet Protocol include closed captioning and requiring cable operators distributing such programming to end users to pass through such captions and identify programming that should be captioned under the Accessibility Act.
Other Regulation.
Currently, the Federal Cable Act's limitations on our collection and disclosure of cable subscribers' personally identifiable information also apply with respect to broadband Internet access service provided by cable operators.Broadband Internet access service is also subject to other federal and state privacy laws applicable to electronic communications.Additionally, providers of broadband Internet access services must comply with the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ("CALEA"), which requires providers to make their services and facilities accessible for law enforcement intercept requests.Various other federal and state laws apply to providers of services that are accessible through broadband Internet access service, including copyright laws, prohibitions on obscenity, and a ban on unsolicited commercial e-mail.Online content provided by Cablevision is also subject to these laws.
Other forms of regulation of high-speed Internet access service currently being considered by the FCC, Congress or state legislatures include consumer protection requirements; additional privacy obligations, as noted above; consumer service standards; requirements to contribute to universal service programs; and requirements to protect personally identifiable customer data from theft.
VoIP The regulatory obligations of VoIP services are the subject of periodic examination and review by FCC, Congress, and state public service commissions.In 2004, for instance, the FCC initiated a generic rulemaking proceeding concerning the legal and regulatory implications of IP-based services, including VoIP services.The FCC has determined that VoIP services with certain characteristics, including cable-provided VoIP services, are interstate services subject to federal rather than state jurisdiction.The FCC's determination was upheld by a federal court of appeals although the court found that the FCC's order did not squarely address the classification of cable-provided VoIP services.Although the FCC has not concluded its generic rulemaking proceeding, it has applied some regulations to VoIP service providers that have certain characteristics (these services are known as "interconnected VoIP services").Some states have asserted the right to regulate cable VoIP service, including imposing fees to support state universal service programs, on the theory that in-state calls can be accurately distinguished from interstate calls.
Universal Service .Interconnected VoIP services must contribute to the federal fund used to subsidize voice services provided to low income households and rural areas and other communications services provided to schools, libraries, and rural health care providers (the "universal service fund").The amount of universal service contribution for interconnected VoIP service providers is based on a percentage of revenues earned from end user interstate services.We allocate our end user revenues and remit payments to the universal service fund in accordance with the FCC order.The FCC has ruled that that states may impose state universal service fees on certain types of VoIP providers, which may include cable VoIP providers.In October 2011, the FCC adopted an order that fundamentally revised its federal universal service fund programs to target support to broadband networks and services, as well as voice services provided over broadband.
(16) Table of Contents Local Number Portability .The FCC requires interconnected VoIP service providers and their "numbering partners" to ensure that their customers have the ability to port their telephone numbers when changing providers to or from the interconnected VoIP service.The FCC also has clarified that local exchange carriers and commercial mobile radio service providers have an obligation to port numbers to interconnected VoIP service providers upon a valid port request.Interconnected VoIP service providers are also required to contribute to federal funds to meet the shared costs of local number portability ("LNP") and the costs of North American Numbering Plan Administration.
The FCC is reviewing the implementation of LNP for interconnected VoIP services, including whether all current numbering requirements should be extended to interconnected VoIP services.The FCC has also adopted new rules requiring providers to port telephone numbers for residential customers within 24 hours.
Intercarrier Compensation .In October 2011, the FCC revised the current regime governing payments among providers of voice services for the exchange of calls between and among different networks ("intercarrier compensation") to include interconnected VoIP.The FCC clarified that prospectively, VoIP traffic exchanged with another carrier in time division multiplexing ("TDM") format must be compensated at the interstate rate for toll traffic and at otherwise applicable intercarrier compensation rates for other traffic.Intercarrier compensation for all traffic, including VoIP traffic exchanged in TDM format, will be phased down over several years to a "bill-and-keep" regime, with no compensation between carriers for most traffic exchanged.
Other Regulation.
Interconnected VoIP service providers are required to provide enhanced 911 emergency services to their customers; protect customer proprietary network information from unauthorized disclosure to third parties; and comply with disabilities access requirements and service discontinuance obligations.Interconnected VoIP service providers are also required to be compliant with CALEA standards.
Other Services We may provide other services and features over our cable television system, such as games and interactive advertising, that may be subject to a range of federal, state, and local laws such as privacy and consumer protection regulations.We also maintain various websites that provide information and content regarding our businesses and offer merchandise for sale.The operation of these websites is also subject to a similar range of regulations.
Optimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLECs The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was enacted to remove barriers to entry in the local telephone market that continues to be dominated by the Bell Operating Companies ("BOCs") and other ILECs by preempting state and local laws that restrict competition and by requiring ILECs to provide competitors, such as cable operators and long distance companies, with nondiscriminatory access and interconnection to the BOC and ILEC networks and access to certain portions of their communications networks (known as network elements) at cost-based rates.The 1996 Telecommunications Act entitles our Optimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLEC subsidiaries to certain rights, but as telecommunications carriers, it also subjects them to regulation by the FCC and the states.Their designation as telecommunications carriers also results in other regulations that may affect them and the services they offer.
(17) Table of Contents Interconnection and Intercarrier Compensation.
The 1996 Telecommunications Act requires telecommunications carriers to interconnect directly or indirectly with other telecommunications carriers.Under the FCC's intercarrier compensation rules, Optimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLECs are entitled, in some cases, to compensation from carriers when they terminate their originating calls on their networks and in other cases are required to compensate another carrier for utilizing that carrier's network to terminate traffic.The FCC has adopted limits on the amounts of compensation that may be charged for certain types of traffic.As noted above, the FCC has revised its intercarrier compensation rules to phase intercarrier compensation rates down over several years to eventually establish a "bill-and-keep" intercarrier compensation regime, where most traffic is exchanged between carriers without compensation.
Universal Service.
Optimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLECs are required to contribute to federal and state universal service funds.Currently, the FCC assesses them for payments and other subsidies on the basis of a percentage of interstate revenue they receive from certain customers.The FCC limits the amount carriers may place on universal service line items on their customer bills.Optimum Lightpath is required to contribute to the New York Targeted Accessibility Fund ("TAF"), which includes state support for universal service.State universal service funds have not been established in other states in which Optimum Lightpath operates.The Bresnan CLECs are required to contribute to state universal service funds in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.No state universal service fund has been established in Montana.As noted above, the FCC has made fundamental changes to its federal universal service fund programs, reorienting universal service support programs to the provision of broadband services through a new Connect America Fund ("CAF").
Other Regulation.
Optimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLECs are also subject to other FCC requirements in connection with the interstate long distance services they provide, including protecting customer proprietary network information from unauthorized disclosure to third parties; meeting certain notice requirements in the event of service termination; compliance with disabilities access requirements; compliance with CALEA standards; and the payment of fees to fund local number portability administration and the North American Numbering Plan.Their communications with their customers are also subject to FCC, Federal Trade Commission, and state regulations on telemarketing and the sending of unsolicited commercial e-mail and fax messages.
State Regulation.
Optimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLECs are also subject to regulation by the state commissions in each state in which they provide service.In order to provide service, they must seek approval from the state regulatory commission or be registered to provide service in each state in which they operate and may at times require local approval to construct facilities.Optimum Lightpath is currently authorized and provides service in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey; the Bresnan CLECs are currently authorized or registered and provide service in Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming.Regulatory obligations vary from state to state and include some or all of the following requirements: filing tariffs (rates, terms and conditions); filing operational, financial, and customer service reports; seeking approval to transfer the assets or capital stock of the telephone company; seeking approval to issue stocks, bonds and other forms of indebtedness of the telephone company; reporting customer service and quality of service requirements; making contributions to state universal service support programs; geographic build-out; and other matters relating to competition.
Programming and Entertainment Cable television programming networks, such as the News12 Networks and MSG Varsity, are regulated by the FCC in certain respects. These regulations include requirements that certain of the Company's networks must provide closed-captioning of programming for the hearing impaired.
(18) Table of Contents Wireless Licenses Through subsidiaries, the Company holds interests in two sets of wireless licenses.First, an indirect subsidiary of the Company owns a 90% interest in MVDDS licenses in 45 metropolitan areas including New York, Miami, Los Angeles, and Cleveland. These licenses, which permit the use of one-way video and data services, expire in September 2014.We are required to demonstrate that we are providing "substantial service" in order to renew the licenses.We are currently using these licenses to provide service to several hundred customers in Florida.The FCC's rules prohibit us from holding more than a 20% interest in the MVDDS license in the New York market because of common ownership with our cable systems there, but we have obtained a waiver of this restriction through the end of the license term.Second, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bresnan Cable holds three licenses that permit us to provide wireless broadband services in parts of Montana and Wyoming.In order to fully retain the licenses, we are required to meet specified coverage requirements by June2013 and at the end of the license term in June 2019.We are not currently using these licenses to provide commercial service.
Employees and Labor Relations As of December31, 2011, we had 15,451 full-time, 1,593 part-time and 771 temporary employees of which 580, 583 and 44, respectively, were covered under collective bargaining agreements.We believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory.
On January26, 2012, a majority of the Company's technician workforce in Brooklyn, New York voted to be represented by the Communication Workers of America.The total unit of employees is comprised of 282 full time workers.We expect to engage in negotiations over a collective bargaining agreement.
Available Information and Website We make available free of charge, through our investor relations section at our website, http://www.cablevision.com/investor/index.jsp, our Annual Report on Form10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q and our Current Reports on Form8-K reports and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
The public may read and copy any materials the Company files with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100FStreet, N.E., Washington, DC 20549.In addition, the public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at its web site http://www.sec.gov .
Item 1A.
Risk Factors The financial markets are subject to volatility and disruptions, which have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect our business, including by affecting the cost of new capital, our ability to refinance our scheduled debt maturities and our ability to meet our other obligations as they come due.The economic downturn has adversely affected our business and may continue to do so.
The capital and credit markets experience volatility and disruption.At times, the markets have exerted extreme downward pressure on stock prices and upward pressure on the cost of new debt capital and have severely restricted credit availability for most issuers.
The market disruptions have been accompanied by a broader economic downturn, which has led to lower demand for our products, such as cable television services and entertainment, as well as lower levels of television and newspaper advertising, and increased incidence of customers' inability to pay for the services we provide.Continuation or worsening of these conditions may further adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
(19) Table of Contents We rely on the capital markets, particularly for offerings of debt securities, as well as the credit markets, to meet our financial commitments and liquidity needs.Disruptions and/or volatility in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance on satisfactory terms, or at all, our scheduled debt maturities and could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities.
A continuation or worsening of the economic downturn may impact our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions in our indentures, credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness and may impact our ability to pay our indebtedness as it comes due.If we do not repay our debt obligations when they become due and do not otherwise comply with the covenants and restrictions in our indentures, credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we would be in default under those agreements, and the debt incurred under those agreements could then be declared immediately due and payable.In addition, any default under our indentures, credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross-default provisions.If the indebtedness under our indentures, credit facilities and our other debt instruments were accelerated, we would not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due thereunder.To avoid a default, we could be required to defer capital expenditures, sell assets, seek strategic investments from third parties or reduce or eliminate dividend payments and stock repurchases or other discretionary uses of cash.However, if such measures were to become necessary, there can be no assurance that we would be able to sell sufficient assets or raise strategic investment capital sufficient to meet our scheduled debt maturities as they come due.In addition, any significant reduction in necessary capital expenditures could adversely affect our ability to retain our existing customer base and obtain new customers, which would adversely affect our future operating results, cash flows and financial position.
Disruptions in the capital and credit markets can also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities.Such disruptions would increase our interest expense, adversely affecting our results of operations and financial position.
Our access to funds under our revolving credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to those facilities to meet their funding commitments.Those financial institutions may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. Moreover, the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facilities are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others.
Longer term, volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation of financial institutions, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses.Such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.
We have substantial indebtedness and we are highly leveraged, which reduces our capability to withstand adverse developments or business conditions.
We have incurred substantial amounts of indebtedness to finance operations, to upgrade our cable plant and acquire other cable television systems, programming networks, sources of programming and other businesses.We also have incurred substantial indebtedness in order to offer our new or upgraded services to our current and potential customers and to pursue activities outside our core businesses such as our acquisitions of an electronics retailer, Clearview Cinemas, Newsday and our development of Rainbow DBS. In 2006, CSC Holdings incurred $3.5billion of debt, approximately $3.0billion of which was distributed to Cablevision to fund a $10 per share dividend on its common stock and approximately $414million of which was used to repay existing indebtedness, including interest, fees and expenses.In December 2010, we incurred approximately $1.4billion of indebtedness to finance our acquisition of Bresnan Cable.We may continue to incur substantial amounts of debt in the future.At December31, 2011, our total indebtedness aggregated approximately $11.2billion.Because of our substantial indebtedness, we are highly leveraged and we will continue to be highly leveraged.This means that our payments on our borrowings are significant in relation to our revenues and cash flow.This leverage exposes us to significant risk in the event of downturns in our businesses (whether through competitive pressures or otherwise), in our industries or in the economy generally, because although our cash flows would decrease in this scenario, our required payments in respect of indebtedness would not.
(20) Table of Contents We have in past periods incurred substantial losses from continuing operations, we have a significant stockholders' deficiency, and we may in the future incur net losses which could be substantial, which may reduce our ability to raise needed capital.
We have in the past reported losses from continuing operations and we may in the future incur significant operating losses.Significant operating losses may limit our ability to raise needed financing, or to do so on favorable terms, as such losses could be taken into account by potential investors, lenders and the organizations that issue investment ratings on our indebtedness.
A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by ratings agencies may further increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.
The debt ratings for our debt securities are below the "investment grade" category, which results in higher borrowing costs as well as a reduced pool of potential purchasers of our debt as some investors will not purchase debt securities that are not rated in an investment grade rating category.In addition, there can be no assurance that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency, if in that rating agency's judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant.A lowering or withdrawal of a rating may further increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.
Our ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness may be restricted by limitations on our subsidiaries' ability to send us funds.
Cablevision's sole subsidiary is CSC Holdings.CSC Holdings' principal subsidiaries include various entities that own cable television systems and other businesses.Cablevision's ability to pay interest on and repay principal of its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the operations of CSC Holdings and its subsidiaries and the distributions or other payments of the cash they generate to Cablevision in the form of distributions, loans or advances.Similarly, CSC Holdings' ability to pay interest and principal on its indebtedness is dependent in part on distributions from its subsidiaries.The Company's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on the Company's indebtedness or to make any funds available to the Company to do so.Bresnan Cable is a party to a credit agreement and indenture that contain various financial and operating covenants that restrict the payment of dividends or other distributions.In addition, Newsday LLC is a party to a credit agreement that contains various financial and operating covenants that restrict the payment of dividends or other distributions.In addition, our subsidiaries' creditors, including trade creditors, in the event of a liquidation or reorganization of any subsidiary, would be entitled to a claim on the assets of such subsidiaries, including any assets transferred to those subsidiaries, prior to any of our claims as a stockholder and those creditors are likely to be paid in full before any distribution is made to us.To the extent that we are a creditor of a subsidiary, our claims could be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and/or any indebtedness of that subsidiary senior to that held by us.
(21) Table of Contents Our ability to incur debt and the use of our funds are limited by significant restrictive covenants in financing agreements.
Our credit facilities and debt instruments contain various financial and operating covenants that, among other things, require the maintenance of financial ratios and restrict the relevant borrower's ability to incur debt from other sources and to use funds for various purposes, including investments in some subsidiaries.Violation of these covenants could result in a default that would permit the parties who have lent money under such credit facilities and such other debt instruments to:  restrict the ability to borrow undrawn funds under such credit facilities, and  require the immediate repayment of the borrowings thereunder.
These events would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the value of our debt and equity securities.
We will need to raise significant amounts of funding over the next several years to fund capital expenditures, repay existing obligations and meet other obligations and the failure to do so successfully could adversely affect our business.We may also engage in extraordinary transactions that involve the incurrence of large amounts of debt.
Our business is very capital intensive.Operating and maintaining our cable television plant requires significant amounts of cash payments to third parties.Capital expenditures for our businesses were $814.8million, $823.2million and $737.5million, in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and primarily include payments for customer premises equipment, such as new digital video cable boxes and modems, as well as infrastructure and capital expenditures related to our cable and Optimum Lightpath telecommunications networks, in addition to the capital requirements of our other businesses.Historically, we have made substantial investments in the development of new and innovative programming options and other service offerings for our customers as a way of differentiating ourselves from our competitors.We currently anticipate a significant increase in our level of capital expenditures to enhance our service offerings.We have substantial future capital commitments in the form of long-term contracts that require substantial payments over a long period of time.We will not be able to generate sufficient cash internally to fund anticipated capital expenditures, meet these obligations and repay our indebtedness at maturity.Accordingly, we will have to do one or more of the following:  refinance existing obligations to extend maturities,  raise additional capital, through debt or equity issuances or both,  cancel or scale back current and future spending programs, or  sell assets or interests in one or more of our businesses.
However, you should not assume that we will be able to refinance existing obligations or raise any required additional capital or to do so on favorable terms.Borrowing costs related to future capital raising activities may be significantly higher than our current borrowing costs and we may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all, if unsettled conditions in financial markets continue to exist.If we are unable to pursue our current and future spending programs, we may be forced to cancel or scale back those programs.Our choice of which spending programs to cancel or reduce may be limited.Failure to successfully pursue our capital expenditure and other spending plans could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.It is possible that in the future we may also engage in extraordinary transactions and such transactions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness.
(22) Table of Contents Our financial performance may be harmed by the significant and credible risks of competition in our Telecommunications Services segment.
Competition could adversely affect our business and financial results and our ability to service our debt.This risk is heightened by the rapid technological change inherent in our business and the need to acquire, develop and adopt new technology to differentiate our products and services from our competitors.We may need to anticipate far in advance which technology we should use for the development of new products and services or the enhancement of existing products and services.In addition, changes in the regulatory and legislative environments may result in changes to the competitive landscape.
In our New York metropolitan service area, we face intense competition from two incumbent telephone companies, Verizon and AT&T, which offer video programming in addition to their voice and high-speed Internet access services, and compete across all of our telecommunications products.Verizon has constructed fiber to the home network plant that passes a significant number of households in our New York metropolitan service area (while difficult to assess, our estimates indicate that Verizon passes more than 45% of the households, based on currently available information).Verizon has obtained authority to provide video service for a majority of these homes passed, on a statewide basis in New Jersey, in numerous local franchises in New York State, including all of New York City, and in a small portion of Connecticut.AT&T offers video service in competition with us in most of our Connecticut service area.Each of these companies has significantly greater financial resources than we do.The attractive demographics of our New York metropolitan service territory make this region a desirable location for investment in video distribution technologies by these companies.Verizon has made and may continue to make promotional offers to customers in our New York metropolitan service area at prices lower than ours.This intense competition affects our ability to add or retain customers and creates pressure upon our pricing of telecommunications services and our ability to expand services purchased by our customers.Verizon and AT&T have their own wireless phone facilities, and may expand their product offerings to include wireless phone services.Because we do not have wireless phone facilities, our inability to provide a competitive product offering could adversely affect our competitive position.We also compete in our service areas with the two major providers of DBS service in the United States, DISH Network and DirecTV, each with significantly higher numbers of subscribers than we have.
Another source of competition for c able television systems is the delivery of video content over the Internet directly to subscribers.
In addition, consumers are able to watch such Internet-delivered content on Internet-ready television sets and mobile devices.Some of these services charge a nominal or no fee for access to their content.The availability of these services could adversely affect customer demand for our video services, including premium and on-demand services.Cable television systems also face competition from broadcast television stations, entities that make digital video recorded movies and programs available for home rental or sale, SMATV systems, which generally serve large multiple dwelling units under an agreement with the landlord and service providers that utilize the public rights-of-way and operate an OVS system.RCN is authorized to operate OVS systems that compete with us in New York City.The FCC also has made radio spectrum available for the provision of multichannel video service.
Our high-speed data offering to consumers faces intense competition from other providers of high-speed Internet access including services offered by local telephone providers such as Verizon, AT&T in our New York metropolitan service area and CenturyLink in our Optimum West service area.In addition, DBS providers have tested the use of certain spectrum to offer satellite-based high-speed data services.Cellular phone providers are also increasing the speeds of their Internet access offerings, and the FCC has made other radio spectrum available for wireless high-speed Internet access.
Our voice service offerings to consumers face intense competition from other providers of voice services, including carriers such as Verizon, AT&T and CenturyLink and other competitive providers of voice services, as well as VoIP providers like Vonage.
(23) Table of Contents Optimum Lightpath also competes with Verizon, AT&T and other competitive local exchange carriers and long distance companies.We also operate CLECs in each state within the Optimum West service area (the "Bresnan CLECs"), which compete against ILECs and Century Link.ILECs have significant advantages over Optimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLECs, including greater capital resources, an existing fully operational local network, and long-standing relationships with customers. To the extent these competitors decide to reduce their prices, future success of our Optimum Lightpath business and our Bresnan CLECs may be negatively impacted.The trend in business communications has been shifting from a wired voice medium to a wireless data medium.This trend could also negatively impact the future growth of Optimum Lightpath if it were to accelerate.
We face significant risks as a result of rapid changes in technology and consumer expectations and behavior The Telecommunications services industry has undergone significant technological development over time and these changes continue to affect our business.Such changes have had, and will continue to have, a profound impact on consumer expectations and behavior.Our video business faces technological change risks as a result of the continuing development of new and changing methods for delivery of programming content such as Internet based delivery of movies, shows and other content which can be viewed on televisions, wireless devices and other developing mobile devices.A proliferation of delivery systems for video content can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain subscribers and the demand for our services and it can also decrease advertising demand on our delivery systems.Our high-speed data business faces technological challenges from rapidly evolving wireless Internet solutions.Our voice offerings face technological developments in the proliferation of voice delivery systems including those based on Internet and wireless delivery.If we do not develop or acquire and successfully implement new technologies, we will limit our ability to compete effectively for subscribers, content and advertising.In addition, we may be required to make material capital and other investments to anticipate and to keep up with technological change.These challenges could adversely affect our business.
Our Newsday business has suffered operating losses historically and such losses are expected to continue in the future.
Newsday suffered operating losses of $31.7million for the year ended December31, 2011 and $12.6million for each of the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, which included impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and certain long-lived intangible assets of $11.0million, $7.8million, and $2.0million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Operating losses are expected to continue in the future.In connection with the formation of a company through which we have an approximate 97.2% interest in Newsday, its subsidiary, Newsday LLC incurred $650.0million of indebtedness under a senior secured loan facility and $630.0million of the proceeds of these borrowings were paid to Newsday's former owner, Tribune Company.These borrowings are guaranteed by CSC Holdings.In addition, at December31, 2011, Newsday Holdings LLC held $753.7million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by Cablevision.Newsday LLC has agreed that it will hold Cablevision or CSC Holdings senior notes or cash balances in excess of the amount of borrowings outstanding under its senior secured credit facility until it matures.
Demand for advertising, increased competition and declines in circulation affect Newsday.
A majority of the revenues of our Newsday business are from advertising.Expenditures by advertisers generally reflect economic conditions and declines in national and local economic conditions affect demand for advertising and the levels of advertising revenue for Newsday.
(24) Table of Contents Newsday operates in a highly competitive market which may adversely affect advertising and circulation revenues.Newsday faces significant competition for advertising revenue from a variety of media sources.The most direct source of competition is other newspapers that reach a similar audience in the same geographic area.Newsday also faces competition from magazines, shopping guides, yellow pages, websites, mobile-device platforms, broadcast and cable television, radio and direct marketing; particularly if those media sources provide advertising services that could substitute for those provided by Newsday within the same geographic area.Specialized websites for real estate, automobile and help wanted advertising have become increasingly competitive with our newspapers and websites for classified advertising and further development of additional targeted websites is likely.
Newsday and the newspaper industry generally have also experienced significant declines in advertising and circulation revenue as circulation and readership levels continue to be adversely affected by competition from new media news formats and less reliance on newspapers by some consumers as a source of news, particularly younger consumers.A prolonged decline in circulation would have a material adverse effect on the rate and volume of advertising revenues.
A significant amount of our book value consists of intangible assets that may not generate cash in the event of a voluntary or involuntary sale.
At December31, 2011, we reported approximately $7.1billion of consolidated total assets, of which $2.0billion were intangible.Intangible assets include franchises from city and county governments to operate cable television systems and goodwill.While we believe that the carrying values of our intangible assets are recoverable, you should not assume that we would receive any cash from the voluntary or involuntary sale of these intangible assets, particularly if we were not continuing as an operating business.We urge you to read carefully our consolidated financial statements contained herein, which provide more detailed information about these intangible assets.
Programming costs of our cable television systems are increasing and we may not have the ability to pass these increases on to our subscribers.Disputes with programmers can adversely affect our relationship with subscribers and lead to subscriber losses.
Programming costs paid by our cable television systems are one of our largest categories of expenses.These costs have increased rapidly and are expected to continue to increase, particularly with respect to costs for sports programming and broadcast networks.We may not be able to pass programming cost increases on to our subscribers due to the increasingly competitive environment.If we are unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our subscribers, our operating results would be adversely affected.
We attempt to control our programming costs and, therefore, the cost of our video services to our customers by negotiating favorable terms for the renewal of our affiliation agreements with programmers.On certain occasions in the past, such negotiations have led to disputes with programmers that have resulted in temporary periods where we were not carrying a particular programming service or services.Such disputes may inconvenience some of our subscribers and can lead to customer dissatisfaction and, in certain cases, the loss of customers.
Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do.
Our cable television and other telecommunications businesses are heavily regulated and operate pursuant to detailed statutory and regulatory requirements at the federal, state and local level.See "Item1.Business - Regulation".In certain of our service areas, state or local franchising authorities extensively regulate the basic rates we may charge our customers for certain of our video services in accordance with FCC rules.The FCC and state and local governments also regulate us in other ways that affect the daily conduct of our video delivery and video programming businesses, our voice business and our high-speed Internet access business.In addition, our businesses are dependent upon governmental authorizations to carry on their operations. See discussion under "Item1.Business -Regulation".
(25) Table of Contents Legislative enactments, court actions and federal, state, and local regulatory proceedings frequently modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate.The results of these legislative, judicial and administrative actions may materially adversely affect our business or results of operations.New requirements giving third parties access to our network or other assets, for example, could materially affect our ability to compete.Changes to regulations from which we benefit and on which we depend to run our businesses also could materially affect our operations.Any action with respect to these or other matters by the courts, Congress, the FCC, the states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming or Montana, or concerted action by local regulators, the likelihood or extent of which we cannot predict, could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our current franchises are non-exclusive and our franchisors need not renew our franchises.
Our cable television systems are operated primarily under non-exclusive franchise agreements with state or municipal government franchising authorities, with the latter in some states also subject to approval of state regulatory authorities.Consequently, our business is dependent on our ability to obtain and renew our franchises.Although we have never lost a franchise as a result of a failure to obtain a renewal, our franchises are subject to non renewal or termination under some circumstances.In some cases in New York and New Jersey, franchise agreements have not been renewed by the expiration date, and we operate under temporary authority routinely granted from the state while negotiating renewal terms with the franchise authorities.As of December31, 2011, our ten largest franchise areas comprised approximately 44% of our total video customers and of those, two franchises, Newark and Yonkers, comprising approximately 110,000 video customers, are expired.We are currently operating in these franchise areas under temporary authority.
On December15, 2011, the City of Yonkers and the Company executed a 10-year renewal agreement, which will become effective when approved by the New York State Public Service Commission; such approval is expected in the first half of 2012.
In Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, franchises must be renewed prior to their expiration date, subject to the protections of federal law.Neither the Company nor its predecessor in those states, Bresnan Communications, has ever lost a franchise.
A portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions.Collective bargaining agreements can increase our expenses.Labor disruptions could adversely affect our operations.
As of December31, 2011, approximately 580 of our full-time employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements.On January26, 2012, a majority of the Company's technician workforce in Brooklyn, New York voted to be represented by the Communication Workers of America.The total unit of employees is comprised of 282 full time workers.These employees are not yet covered by a collective bargaining agreement.Collective bargaining agreements with the Communication Workers of America covering this group of employees or agreements with other unionized employees may increase our expenses.In addition, any disruptions to our operations due to labor related problems could have an adverse effect on our business.We cannot predict whether labor unions may be successful in organizing other portions of our workforce or what additional costs we could incur as a result.
We rely on network and information systems for our operations, and a disruption or failure of thosesystems may disrupt our operations.
We have in place layered and multi-threaded security systems designed to protect against intentional or unintentional disruption, failure, misappropriation or corruption of our network and information systems.A problem of this type might be caused by events such as computer hacking, computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, "cyber attacks" and other malicious activity, as well as natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks and similar events.Such events could have an adverse impact on us and our customers, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers and damage to our plant, equipment and data.In addition, our future results could be adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential customer data or intellectual property.Operational or business delays may result from the disruption of network or information systems and the subsequent remediation activities.Moreover, these events may create negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers.
(26) Table of Contents We have expended, and expect to continue to spend in the future, significant amounts to protect our network and information systems; however, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent any of the problems identified above.
The MSG Distribution and the AMC Network Distribution could result in significant tax liability.
We have received private letter rulings from the IRS to the effect that, among other things, the MSG Distribution and the AMC Networks Distribution and certain related transactions, will qualify for tax-free treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
Although a private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS, if the factual representations or assumptions made in the letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect, we will not be able to rely on the ruling.Furthermore, the IRS will not rule on whether a distribution satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under the Code.Rather, the ruling is based upon our representations that these conditions have been satisfied, and any inaccuracy in such representations could invalidate the ruling.
If the MSG Distribution or the AMC Networks Distribution does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S.federal income tax purposes, then, in general, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the Madison Square Garden common stock or AMC Networks common stock, as the case may be, in a taxable sale for its fair value.Cablevision stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had received a distribution equal to the fair value of Madison Square Garden common stock or AMC Networks common stock, as the case may be, that was distributed to them, which generally would be treated as a taxable dividend.It is expected that the amount of any such taxes to Cablevision's stockholders and us would be substantial.
The tax rules applicable to the AMC Networks Distribution may restrict us from engaging in certain corporate transactions or from raising equity capital beyond certain thresholds for a period of time after the AMC Networks Distribution, as applicable.
To preserve the tax-free treatment of the AMC Networks Distribution to AMC Network's and Cablevision's stockholders, under a tax disaffiliation agreement between Cablevision and AMC Networks, for the two-year period following the AMC Networks Distribution, we will be subject to restrictions with respect to our activities, including restrictions relating to certain issuances or repurchases of Cablevision's common stock, asset sales, mergers and liquidations.
These restrictions may limit Cablevision's ability during that two-year period to pursue strategic transactions of a certain magnitude that involve the issuance or acquisition of Cablevision's stock or engage in new businesses or other transactions that might increase the value of our business.These restrictions may also limit our ability to raise significant amounts of cash through the issuance of stock, especially if Cablevision's stock price were to suffer substantial declines, or through the sale of certain of our assets.
We may not enjoy all of the benefits of scale that we achieved prior to the MSG Distribution and the AMC Networks Distribution.
Prior to the MSG Distribution and the AMC Networks Distribution, we shared benefits of scope and scale in costs and expenses resulting from various factors including financial reporting, costs associated with complying with federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), tax administration, legal and human resources related functions.While we entered into agreements with Madison Square Garden and AMC Networks that govern a number of our commercial and other relationships after the MSG Distribution and AMC Networks Distribution, those arrangements do not fully capture the benefits we enjoyed as a result of common ownership prior thereto.In addition, in connection with the AMC Networks Distribution, we terminated an agreement pursuant to which we received a management fee that was based upon revenues of the AMC and WE tv networks.This fee, which amounted to approximately $14.0million for the six months ended June30, 2011, was previously included in the operating income of our Telecommunications Services segment and has been reclassified to discontinued operations.As a result of the MSG Distribution and the AMC Networks Distribution, we now carry a relatively larger share of our administrative and other overhead expenses.The loss of these benefits as a consequence of the MSG Distribution and AMC Networks Distribution could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
(27) Table of Contents In connection with the MSG Distribution and AMC Networks Distribution, we will rely on Madison Square Garden's and AMC Networks' performance under various agreements In connection with the MSG Distribution and the AMC Networks Distribution, we entered into various agreements with Madison Square Garden and AMC Networks, respectively, including a distribution agreement, a tax disaffiliation agreement, a transition services agreement, an employee matters agreement and certain related party arrangements.These agreements govern our relationship with those entities subsequent to the distributions and provide for the allocation of employee benefits, taxes and certain other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the distributions.These agreements also include arrangements with respect to transition services and a number of on-going commercial relationships.The distribution agreements include agreements that we and those entities agree to provide each other with indemnities with respect to liabilities arising out of the businesses we transferred to those entities.We are also party to other arrangements with Madison Square Garden and AMC Networks, such as affiliation agreements covering the MSG networks and Fuse, AMC, WE tv, IFC and Sundance Channel.We and these entities will rely on the other to perform its obligations under these agreements.If Madison Square Garden or AMC Networks were to breach or to be unable to satisfy its material obligations under these agreements, including a failure to satisfy its indemnification obligations, we could suffer operational difficulties or significant losses.
We share certain key executives and directors with Madison Square Garden and AMC Networks, which means those executives will not devote their full time and attention to our affairs.
As a result of the AMC Networks Distribution, our Chairman, Charles F. Dolan, serves as Executive Chairman of AMC Networks.As a result of the MSG Distribution, our President and Chief Executive Officer, JamesL. Dolan, also serves as the Executive Chairman of Madison Square Garden and our Vice Chairman, HankJ. Ratner, serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of Madison Square Garden.This arrangement is similar to the historical situation whereby Messrs.Dolan and Ratner have served as senior officers of Madison Square Garden and CharlesF. Dolan provided senior leadership to our Rainbow segment.As a result, since the MSG Distribution and AMC Networks Distribution, three senior officers of the Company are not devoting their full time and attention to the Company's affairs.In addition, eight members of our Board of Directors are also directors of Madison Square Garden and eight members of our Board of Directors are also directors of AMC Networks.
Our overlapping directors and executive officers may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities and other potential conflicts.
Our Board of Directors has adopted a policy that acknowledges that directors and officers of the Company may also be serving as directors, officers, employees or agents of Madison Square Garden or AMC Networks and their respective subsidiaries and that the Company may engage in material business transactions with such entities.The Company renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and the new policy provides that no director or officer of the Company who is also serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of Madison Square Garden or AMC Networks and their respective subsidiaries will be liable to the Company or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of opportunities set forth in the policy) to Madison Square Garden or AMC Networks or any of their respective subsidiaries instead of the Company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunities to the Company.The policy expressly validates certain contracts, agreements, assignments and transactions (and amendments, modifications or terminations thereof) between the Company and Madison Square Garden or AMC Networks and/or any of their respective subsidiaries and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provides that the actions of the overlapping directors or officers in connection therewith are not breaches of fiduciary duties owed to the Company, any of its subsidiaries or their respective stockholders.
(28) Table of Contents We are controlled by the Dolan family.As a result of their control of us, the Dolan family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.
Cablevision has two classes of common stock:  ClassB common stock, which is generally entitled to ten votes per share and is entitled collectively to elect 75% of the Cablevision Board of Directors, and  ClassA common stock, which is entitled to one vote per share and is entitled collectively to elect the remaining 25% of the Cablevision Board of Directors.
As of February14, 2012, the Dolan family, including trusts for the benefit of members of the Dolan family, collectively beneficially owned all of Cablevision's ClassB common stock, less than 2% of Cablevision's outstanding ClassA common stock and approximately 72% of the total voting power of all the outstanding Cablevision common stock.Of this amount, our Chairman, CharlesF. Dolan, beneficially owned approximately 59% of Cablevision's outstanding ClassB common stock, less than 1% of Cablevision's outstanding ClassA common stock and approximately 42% of the total voting power of all the outstanding Cablevision common stock.The members of the Dolan family holding ClassB common stock have executed a voting agreement that has the effect of causing the voting power of the ClassB stockholders to be cast as a block with respect to the election of the directors elected by the ClassB stockholders and any change of control transaction.The Dolan family is able to prevent a change in control of Cablevision and no person interested in acquiring Cablevision will be able to do so without obtaining the consent of the Dolan family.In the past, the Dolan family has madeproposals to take Cablevision private, including a 2007 transaction that was submitted to a vote of Cablevision's stockholders but that did not receive shareholder approval.In each such case, the Dolan family stated that they were only interested in pursuing their proposed transaction and would not sell their stake in Cablevision.There can be no assurances that the Dolan family will not propose, undertake or consummate a similar transaction in the future.
As a result of the Dolan family's ownership of all of the ClassB common stock, the Dolan family has the power to elect all the directors of Cablevision subject to election by holders of ClassB common stock.Those directors constitute a majority of Cablevision's Board of Directors.In addition, Dolan family members may control stockholder decisions on matters in which holders of all classes of Cablevision common stock vote together as a single class.These matters could include the amendment of some provisions of Cablevision's certificate of incorporation and the approval of fundamental corporate transactions.In addition, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66-23% of the outstanding shares of the ClassB common stock, voting separately as a class, is required to approve the authorization or issuance of any additional shares of ClassB common stock.Furthermore, the Dolan family members also have the power to prevent any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of Cablevision's certificate of incorporation that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the ClassB common stock.
One purpose of the voting agreement referred to above is to consolidate Dolan family control of Cablevision.The Dolan family requested Cablevision's Board of Directors to exercise Cablevision's right, as a "controlled company", to opt-out of the New York Stock Exchange listing standards that, among other things, require listed companies to have a majority of independent directors on their board and to have an independent corporate governance and nominating committee.Cablevision's Board of Directors and the directors elected by holders of ClassA common stock each approved this request on March8, 2004.

(33) Table of Contents CNYG Stock Performance Graph The chart below compares the performance of the Company's CNYG ClassA common stock with the performance of the S&P 500 Index and a Peer Group Index by measuring the changes in CNYG ClassA common stock prices from December31, 2006 through December31, 2011.As required by the SEC, the values shown assume the reinvestment of all dividends and also reflect the effect of the AMC Distribution and MSG Distribution.Because no published index of comparable media companies currently reports values on a dividends-reinvested basis, the Company has created a Peer Group Index for purposes of this graph in accordance with the requirements of the SEC.The Peer Group Index is made up of companies that engage in cable television operations as a significant element of their business, although not all of the companies included in the Peer Group Index participate in all of the lines of business in which the Company is engaged and some of the companies included in the Peer Group Index also engage in lines of business in which the Company does not participate.Additionally, the market capitalizations of many of the companies included in the Peer Group are quite different from that of the Company.The common stocks of the following companies have been included in the Peer Group Index for 2011:Comcast Corporation, Mediacom Communications Corporation (until March4, 2011 when Mediacom stock ceased trading), Time Warner Cable Inc. (from January5, 2007, when Time Warner Cable stock began trading), and Charter Communications (from December2, 2009, when Charter emerged from bankruptcy).The chart assumes $100 was invested on December31, 2006 in each of the Company's CNYG ClassA common stock, the S&P 500 Index and in a Peer Group Index and reflects reinvestment of dividends on a quarterly basis and market capitalization weighting.

(1) Reflects data related to Bresnan Cable which was acquired by the Company on December14, 2010.
(2) Represents number of households/businesses that receive at least one of the Company's services.
(3) Video customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets.In calculating the number of customers, we count all customers other than inactive/disconnected customers.Free accounts are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group such as our current and retired employees.Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services.Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion.We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual room units at that hotel.In counting bulk residential customers such as an apartment building, we count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer.
(4) Represents the estimated number of single residence homes, apartment and condominium units and commercial establishments passed by the cable distribution network in areas serviceable without further extending the transmission lines, including our Optimum Lightpath customers.
(5) RPS is calculated by dividing the average monthly GAAP revenues for the Telecommunications Services segment, less the revenue attributable to Optimum Lightpath, for the fourth quarter of each year presented by the average number of video customers served by our cable television systems for the same period.For purposes of this calculation, both revenue and average number of video customers exclude our Optimum Lightpath operations because Optimum Lightpath's third-party revenues are unrelated to our cable television system customers.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on general economic conditions including capital and credit market conditions, the impact of direct competition, our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers.
Additional capital and credit market disruptions could cause broader economic downturns, which may lead to lower demand for our products, such as cable television services, as well as lower levels of television and newspaper advertising, and increased incidence of customer's inability to pay for the services we provide.We have experienced some of the effects of this economic downturn.Continuation of events such as these may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
On February9, 2010, Cablevision distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of Madison Square Garden, a company which owns the sports, entertainment and media businesses previously owned and operated by the Company's Madison Square Garden segment.
On June30, 2011, Cablevision distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock ofAMC Networks Inc., a company which consists principally of national programming networks, including AMC, WE tv, IFC and Sundance Channel, previously owned and operated by the Company's Rainbow segment.
As a result of the AMC Networks Distribution and the MSG Distribution, the Company no longer consolidates the financial results of AMC Networks or Madison Square Garden for the purpose of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden have been reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the AMC Networks Distribution date and the MSG Distribution date.
Telecommunications Services Our Telecommunications Services segment, which accounted for 94% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter-segment eliminations, for the year ended December31, 2011, derives revenues principally through monthly charges to subscribers of our video, high-speed data and VoIP services and commercial data and voice services operations.These monthly charges include fees for cable television programming, high-speed data and voice services, as well as equipment rental, DVR, video-on-demand, pay-per-view, installation and home shopping commissions.
Revenue increases are derived from rate increases, increases in the number of subscribers to these services, including additional services sold to our existing subscribers, upgrades by video customers in the level of programming package to which they subscribe, and acquisition transactions that result in the addition of new subscribers .
We have not implemented a residential rate increase in 2012 and plan to extend the term of certain promotional offers, which will negatively impact revenue growth and our operating income.In addition, our ability to increase the number of subscribers to our services is significantly related to our penetration rates (the number of subscribers to our services as a percentage of serviceable passings, which represent the estimated number of single residence homes, apartment and condominium units and commercial establishments passed by the cable network in areas serviceable without further extending the transmission lines, including our commercial data and voice customers).As penetration rates increase, the number of available homes to which we can market our services generally decreases.We also derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems.Programming costs are the most significant part of our operating expenses and are expected to continue to increase primarily as a result of contractual rate increases and additional service offerings.Additionally, we currently anticipate an increase in our operating expenses as we make additional investments designed to enhance our products and services with a focus on retention and acquisition of subscribers.
(41) Table of Contents In 2011, in our New York metropolitan service area, we began offering a free Optimum App for the iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone, which allows our cable television customers to experience iO TV digital service on their device in the home.While most programmers have not objected to the inclusion of their programming in the in-home application, certain programmers have asserted that the application is a material breach of their affiliation agreements and a copyright violation yielding statutory damages.The Company has reached satisfactory resolutions of the issues with certain of these programmers. Other programmers continue to have concerns, but the Company believes it has a strong legal position.
Our cable television service, which accounted for 54% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter-segment eliminations, for the year ended December31, 2011, faces competition from video service provided by incumbent telephone companies, DBS service providers and others.As discussed in greater detail below, we face intense competition in our New York metropolitan service area from two incumbent telephone companies Verizon and AT&T, which offer video programming in addition to their voice and high-speed Internet access services.To the extent the incumbent telephone companies, who have financial resources that exceed ours, continue to offer promotional packages at prices lower than ours, our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue may continue to be negatively impacted.There are two major providers of DBS service in the United States, DISH Network and DirecTV, each with significantly higher numbers of subscribers than we have.We compete in our service areas with these DBS competitors by "bundling" our service offerings with products that the DBS companies cannot efficiently provide at this time, such as high-speed data service, voice service and interactive services carried over the cable distribution plant.Historically, we have made substantial investments in the development of new and innovative programming options and other service offerings for our customers as a way of differentiating ourselves from our competitors.We currently anticipate a significant increase in our level of capital expenditures to enhance our product and service offerings.
Verizon and AT&T offer video programming as well as voice and high-speed Internet access services to residential customers in our New York metropolitan service area.Verizon has constructed fiber to the home network plant that passes a significant number of households in our New York metropolitan service area (while difficult to assess, our estimates indicate that Verizon passes more than 45% of these households, based on currently available information).Verizon has obtained authority to provide video service for a majority of these homes passed, on a statewide basis in New Jersey, in numerous local franchises in New York State, including all of New York City, and in a small portion of Connecticut.AT&T offers video service in competition with us in most of our Connecticut service area.This competition impacts our video revenue in these areas and may continue to do so in the future.
Our high-speed data services business, which accounted for 20% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter-segment eliminations, for the year ended December31, 2011, faces intense competition from other providers of high-speed Internet access, including Verizon and AT&T in our New York metropolitan service area and CenturyLink in our Optimum West service area.Due to our high penetration in our New York metropolitan service area (54.9% of serviceable passings at December31, 2011) and the impact of intense competition, our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future may continue to be negatively impacted.
Our VoIP offering, which accounted for 13% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter-segment eliminations, for the year ended December31, 2011, faces intense competition from other providers of voice services, including carriers such as Verizon and AT&T in the New York metropolitan service area and CenturyLink in our Optimum West service area.We compete primarily on the basis of pricing, where unlimited United States and Canada (including Puerto Rico in the New York metropolitan service area and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Optimum West service area) long distance, regional and local calling, together with certain features for which the incumbent providers charge extra, are offered at one low price.Due to our high penetration in the New York metropolitan service area (44.7% of serviceable passings at December31, 2011) and the impact of intense competition, our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future may continue to be negatively impacted.
(42) Table of Contents The Telecommunications Services segment advertising and other revenues accounted for 2% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter-segment eliminations, for the year ended December31, 2011.
Optimum Lightpath, which operates in our New York metropolitan service area accounted for 4% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter-segment eliminations, for the year ended December31, 2011.Optimum Lightpath operates in the most competitive business telecommunications market in the country and competes against the very largest telecommunications companies - incumbent local exchange carriers such as Verizon and AT&T, other competitive local exchange companies and long distance companies.To the extent that dominant market leaders decide to reduce their prices, future success of our Optimum Lightpath business may be negatively impacted.The trend in business communications has been shifting from a wired voice medium to a wireless data medium.This trend could also negatively impact the future growth of Optimum Lightpath if it were to accelerate.
Other Our Other segment, which accounted for 6% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter-segment eliminations, for the year ended December31, 2011, includes the operations of (i)Newsday, which includes the Newsday daily newspaper, amNew York, Star Community Publishing Group, and online websites including newsday.com and exploreLI.com, (ii)our motion picture theatre business, Clearview Cinemas, (iii)the News12 Networks, our regional news programming services, (iv)the MSG Varsity network, our network dedicated entirely to showcasing high school sports and activities, (v)our cable television advertising company, Cablevision Media Sales Corporation ("Cablevision Media Sales"), previously known as Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation, and (vi)certain other businesses and unallocated corporate costs.
Newsday Newsday's revenue is derived primarily from the sale of advertising and the sale of newspapers ("circulation revenue").For the year ended December31, 2011, advertising revenues accounted for 71% and circulation revenues accounted for approximately 28% of the total revenues of Newsday.Newsday's circulation revenue is derived primarily from home delivery subscriptions of the Newsday newspaper, and single copy sales of Newsday through local retail outlets.
Local economic conditions affect the levels of retail and classified newspaper advertising revenue.General economic conditions, changes in consumer spending, auto sales, housing sales, unemployment rates, job creation, readership and circulation levels and rates all impact demand for advertising.
For the year ended December31, 2011, Newsday experienced a decline of $20,750 (9%) in advertising revenues as compared to 2010. Circulation revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $958 (1%) over the same period in the prior year due primarily to the impact of home delivery price increases.
Newsday and the newspaper industry generally have experienced significant declines in advertising and circulation revenue as circulation and readership levels continue to be adversely affected by competition from new media news formats and less reliance on newspapers by some consumers, particularly younger consumers, as a source of news and classifieds.A prolonged decline in circulation levels would also have a material adverse effect on the rate and volume of advertising revenues.
Newsday's largest categories of operating expenses relate to the production and distribution of its print products.These costs are driven by volume (number of newspapers printed and number of pages printed) and the number of pages printed are impacted by the volume of advertising and editorial pages.The majority of Newsday's other costs, such as editorial content creation, rent and general and administrative expenses do not directly fluctuate with changes in advertising and circulation revenue.
(43) Table of Contents Clearview Cinemas Clearview Cinemas derives revenues primarily from box office ticket sales, concession stand sales, and, to a lesser extent, from advertising shown at the start of each performance and from venue rentals. Our ability to attract customers to our theatres is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to obtain high quality film content at competitive pricing.
News 12 Networks Our News 12 Networks, which include seven 24-hour local news channels and five traffic and weather services dedicated to covering areas within the New York metropolitan area, derives its revenues from the sale of advertising on its networks and affiliation fees paid by cable operators, principally Cablevision.
MSG Varsity MSG Varsity is a network dedicated entirely to showcasing high school sports and activities.It does not receive intercompany affiliation fees from the Telecommunications Services segment and has minimal revenues.
Cablevision Media Sales Cablevision Media Sales, previously Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation, is a cable television advertising company that derives its revenues from the sale of local and regional commercial advertising time on cable television networks in the New York metropolitan area, which offers advertisers the opportunity to target geographic and demographic audiences.
Critical Accounting Policies In preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available.These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, include the following: Impairment of Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets: The Company's long-lived and indefinite-lived assets at December31, 2011 include goodwill of $442,773, other intangible assets of $1,548,994 ($1,296,123 of which are indefinite-lived intangible assets), and $3,269,232 of property, plant and equipment.Such assets accounted for approximately 74% of the Company's consolidated total assets.Goodwill and identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets, which represent primarily the Company's cable television franchises, various trademarks and licenses, are tested annually for impairment during the first quarter ("annual impairment test date") and upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances.
The Company is required to determine goodwill impairment using a two-step process.The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill utilizing an enterprise-value based premise approach.If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.For the purpose of evaluating goodwill impairment at the annual impairment test date, the Company had three reporting units containing approximately 98% of the Company's goodwill balance of $442,067.These reporting units are the Consumer Services (cable television) reporting unit in the Telecommunications Services reportable segment ($401,320), the Optimum Lightpath reporting unit in the Telecommunications Services reportable segment ($21,487), and the Clearview Cinemas reporting unit in the Other reportable segment ($10,348).
(44) Table of Contents The impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value.If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.The following table sets forth the amount of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2011: Reportable Segment Unit of Accounting Identifiable Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Balance Telecommunications Services Cable Television Franchises $ 1,240,228 Other Newsday Trademarks 45,300 Telecommunications Services and Other FCC licenses and other indefinite-lived intangibles 10,595 $ 1,296,123 For other long-lived assets, including intangible assets that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indication of potential impairment.If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value.
In assessing the recoverability of the Company's goodwill and other long-lived assets, the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets.These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge.Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information.These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision.Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions.These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rate, determination of appropriate market comparables and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables.For the reporting units in the Telecommunications Services reportable segment, these valuations also include assumptions for average annual revenue per customer, number of serviceable passings, operating margin and market penetration as a percentage of serviceable passings, among other assumptions.Further, the projected cash flow assumptions consider contractual relationships, customer attrition, eventual development of new technologies and market competition.For Newsday, these valuations also include assumptions for advertising and circulation revenue trends, operating margin, market participant synergies, and market multiples for comparable companies.If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges related to our long-lived assets.
Based on the Company's annual impairment test during the first quarter of 2011, the Company's reporting units had significant safety margins, representing the excess of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit less its respective carrying value (including goodwill allocated to each respective reporting unit).In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value calculations of the Company's reporting units on the annual impairment calculation for goodwill, the Company applied hypothetical 10%, 20% and 30% decreases to the estimated fair values of each reporting unit.These hypothetical decreases of 10%, 20% and 30% would have no impact on the goodwill impairment analysis for any of the Company's reporting units with the exception of the Clearview Cinemas reporting unit.For Clearview Cinemas, which had a goodwill carrying value of $10,348 at December31, 2011, a 22% reduction in its estimated fair value would result in a step one failure.A step one failure would require the Company to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of implied fair value of goodwill and, if required, the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss.
(45) Table of Contents The Company's primary identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets that represent over 95% of the identifiable indefinite-lived intangibles are the Company's cable television franchises and various reporting unit trademarks, which are valued using an income approach or market approach.The Company's cable television franchises are the largest of the Company's identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets and reflect agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area.Our cable television franchises are valued using a discounted cash flows ("DCF") methodology.The DCF methodology used to value cable television franchises entails identifying the projected discrete cash flows related to such cable television franchises and discounting them back to the valuation date.The projected discrete cash flows related to such cable television franchises represent the rights to solicit and the right to service potential customers in the service areas defined by franchise rights currently held by the Company.Significant judgments inherent in a valuation include the selection of appropriate discount rates, estimating the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows attributable to the cable television franchises and identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions.The discount rates used in the DCF analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
Based on the Company's annual impairment test during the first quarter of 2011, the Company's units of accounting that represent approximately 56% of the Company's identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets have significant safety margins, representing the excess of the identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets estimated fair value unit of accounting over their respective carrying values.Bresnan's identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets had no safety margins as they were acquired at fair value in December 2010.In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of all the Company's identifiable indefinite-lived intangibles, the Company applied hypothetical 10%, 20% and 30% decreases to the estimated fair value of each of the Company's identifiable indefinite-lived intangibles.These hypothetical 10%, 20% and 30% decreases in estimated fair value would have resulted in an impairment to the Company's Bresnan related franchise rights, and the Newsday related trademarks, which had a carrying value of $565,000 (approximately $508,000 related to Bresnan) at the annual impairment test date.The hypothetical fair value decreases would have resulted in impairment charges of approximately $56,000 at 10%, approximately $112,000 at 20%, and approximately $168,000 at 30% related to these identifiable indefinite-lived intangibles.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $11,000, $7,800 and $2,000, respectively, relating to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of Newsday's indefinite-lived intangible trademarks.
The Company determined the fair value of our Newsday reporting unit based on a weighting of the estimated fair values determined under the income approach and the market approach.The income approach utilizes a DCF valuation methodology, which requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates based on the assessment of risks inherent in the projected future cash flows including the cash flows generated from potential synergies a market participant may generate, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, including expected cash flows beyond the Company's current long-term business planning period, and certain tax benefits the Company would recognize.The discount rate utilized for the interim impairment assessment was a consolidated weighted average discount rate of 12.5% at December31, 2011 and 12% at December 31, 2010 and 2009.The market approach measures fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable publicly traded newspaper publishing companies and comparable transactions taking into consideration potential synergies a market participant may generate and requires significant judgments in determining comparable market multiples.The weighting between the income approach and market approach was weighted more towards the income approach based on our belief that the income approach was more reliable in the midst of the steep economic decline impacting the publishing industry, and in view of the fact that there were no recent observable sales transactions involving the newspaper business.The estimated fair values of Newsday's indefinite-lived intangibles, which relate primarily to the trademarks associated with its newspaper mastheads, were based on discounted future cash flows calculated based on the relief-from-royalty method.Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.
(46) Table of Contents The reduction in estimated fair values of the trademarks under the relief-from-royalty method was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate for the Newsday print newspaper from 11.5% in 2009 to 12.0% in 2010 and 12.5% in 2011, and a decline in the Company's revenue projections for the Newsday print newspaper and newsday.com in comparison to the revenue projections originally used when Newsday was acquired in July 2008.The primary reason for the increase in the discount rate for the Newsday print newspaper trademark from 11.5% in 2009 to 12.5% in 2011 was due to an increase in both the estimated cost of equity and debt for the industry, which was primarily due to an increase in the economic volatility affecting the overall economy, and in particular the newspaper publishing industry, and an increase in borrowing costs to the industry.The assumed royalty rate remained at 3% for 2009, 2010 and 2011, although this was a decline from the 4% that was originally used when Newsday was acquired.The decrease from 4% to 3% was due to the lower projected margins for the Newsday print newspaper and newsday.com.
Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets: Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Company's future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards ("NOLs").In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.The Company's ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income and tax planning strategies to allow for the utilization of its NOLs and deductible temporary differences.If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense in the Company's consolidated statement of income.Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly.At this time, based on current facts and circumstances, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize benefit for its gross deferred tax assets, except those deferred tax assets against which a valuation allowance has been recorded which relate to certain state NOLs.The Company increased the valuation allowance by $1,822 in 2011, decreased the valuation allowance by $2,428 in 2010 and decreased the valuation allowance by $1,427 in 2009.In connection with the AMC Networks Distribution, a reduction in the valuation allowance of $491 was recorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital.During 2011, 2010 and 2009, certain state NOLs expired prior to utilization.The deferred tax asset corresponding to the expired NOLs had been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The associated deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were both reduced by $425, $287 and $3,609 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.To address state income tax planning considerations, certain subsidiary corporations were converted to limited liability companies during 2009. Certain state NOLs, for which the related deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance, were eliminated pursuant to such conversions.Accordingly, the associated deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were both reduced by $9,355 in 2009.
(47) Table of Contents Plant and Equipment: Costs incurred in the construction of the Company's cable television system, including line extensions to, and upgrade of, the Company's hybrid fiber-coaxial infrastructure and headend facilities are capitalized.These costs consist of materials, subcontractor labor, direct consulting fees, and internal labor and related costs associated with the construction activities.The internal costs that are capitalized consist of salaries and benefits of Company employees and the portion of facility costs, including rent, taxes, insurance and utilities, that supports the construction activities.These costs are depreciated over the estimated life of the plant (10 to 25years) and headend facilities (4 to 25years).Costs of operating the plant and the technical facilities, including repairs and maintenance, are expensed as incurred.
Costs incurred to connect businesses or residences that have not been previously connected to the infrastructure or digital platform are also capitalized.These costs include materials, subcontractor labor, internal labor to connect, provision and provide on-site and remote technical assistance and other related costs associated with the connection activities.In addition, on-site and remote technical assistance during the provisioning process for new digital product offerings are capitalized.The departmental activities supporting the connection process are tracked through specific metrics, and the portion of departmental costs that is capitalized is determined through a time weighted activity allocation of costs incurred based on time studies used to estimate the average time spent on each activity.New connections are amortized over the estimated useful lives of 5 years or 12years for residence wiring and feeder cable to the home, respectively.The portion of departmental costs related to reconnection, programming service up- and down- grade, repair and maintenance, and disconnection activities are expensed as incurred.
The estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant and such lives are revised to the extent necessary due to changing facts and circumstances.Any changes in estimated useful lives are reflected prospectively.
Refer to Note2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form10-K for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to the policies discussed above and other items.
Legal Contingencies The Company is party to various lawsuits and proceedings and is subject to other claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, some involving claims for substantial damages.The Company records an estimated liability for these claims when management believes the loss from such matters is probable and reasonably estimable.The Company reassesses the risk of loss as new information becomes available and adjusts liabilities as necessary.The actual cost of resolving a claim may be substantially different from the amount of the liability recorded.Refer to Note18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form10-K for a discussion of our legal contingencies.
Certain Transactions The following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: (48) Table of Contents 2011 Transactions On June30, 2011, Cablevision completed the AMC Networks Distribution.As a result of the AMC Networks Distribution, the Company no longer consolidates the financial results of AMC Networks for the purpose of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of AMC Networks have been reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the AMC Networks Distribution date.
2010 Transactions On February9, 2010, Cablevision completed the MSG Distribution.As a result of the MSG Distribution, the Company no longer consolidates the financial results of Madison Square Garden for the purpose of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of Madison Square Garden have been reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the MSG Distribution date.
On December14, 2010, the Company completed its acquisition of Bresnan Cable for a purchase price of $1,364,276.The acquisition was financed using an equity contribution by CSC Holdings of $395,000, which CSC Holdings borrowed under its revolving loan facility, and debt consisting of an undrawn $75,000 revolving loan facility, a $765,000 term loan facility and $250,000 8.0% senior notes due 2018.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures We define adjusted operating cash flow (AOCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of stock appreciation rights and, in the case of restricted shares, restricted stock units and stock options, the expense associated with an award that is not expected to be made in cash.
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.AOCF and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.Internally, we use net revenues and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate managements effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.Each presentation of AOCF in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss).

(ii)our motion picture theatre business, Clearview Cinemas, (iii)the News 12 Networks, (iv)the MSG Varsity network, (v)Cablevision Media Sales, a cable television advertising company, and (vi)certain other businesses and unallocated corporate costs.
We allocate certain amounts of our corporate overhead to each segment based upon their proportionate estimated usage of services, except for Newsday as to which we allocated the incremental costs incurred in providing these services through September30, 2009.Subsequent to September30, 2009, we allocated certain amounts of our corporate overhead to Newsday based upon its proportionate estimated usage of such services.Corporate overhead costs previously allocated to AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden that were not eliminated as a result of the AMC Networks Distribution in June 2011 and the MSG Distribution in February 2010 have been reclassified to continuing operations.Subsequent to July1, 2011 and January1, 2010, amounts allocated to AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden, respectively, represent charges pursuant to transition services agreements.
The segment financial information set forth below, including the discussion related to individual line items, does not reflect inter-segment eliminations unless specifically indicated.
See "Business Segments Results" for a discussion relating to the operating results of our segments.In those sections, we provide detailed analysis of the reasons for increases or decreases in the various line items at the segment level.
Revenues, net for the year ended December31, 2011 increased $523,273 (8%) as compared to revenues, net for the prior year.The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in revenues of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 544,131 Decrease in revenues of the Other segment (22,077 ) Inter-segment eliminations 1,219 $ 523,273 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairments) include primarily:  cable programming costs which are costs paid to programmers, net of amortization of any launch support received, for cable content and are generally paid on a per-subscriber basis;  network management and field service costs which represent costs associated with the maintenance of our broadband network, including costs of certain customer connections;  interconnection, call completion and circuit fees relating to our telephone and VoIP businesses which represent the transport and termination of calls with other telecommunications carriers; and  publication production and distribution costs of our Newsday business.
(52) Table of Contents Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairments) in 2011 increased $304,792 (11%) as compared to 2010.The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 314,287 Decrease in expenses of the Other segment (9,558 ) Inter-segment eliminations 63 $ 304,792 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses increased 1% in 2011 as compared to 2010.
Selling, general and administrative expenses include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs, and costs of customer call centers.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $41,613 (3%) for 2011 as compared to 2010.The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 64,319 Decrease in expenses of the Other segment (23,862 ) Inter-segment eliminations 1,156 $ 41,613 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1% in 2011 as compared to 2010.
Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) increased $127,882 (14%) for 2011 as compared to 2010.The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 118,618 Increase in expenses of the Other segment 9,264 $ 127,882 Adjusted operating cash flow increased $171,115 (8%) for the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in AOCF of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 164,275 Increase in AOCF of the Other segment 6,840 $ 171,115 Interest expense, net increased $34,955 (5%) for 2011 as compared to 2010.The net increase is attributable to the following: Net increase due to change in average debt balances $ 36,391 Increase due to higher average interest rates on our indebtedness 9,887 Higher interest income (339 ) Other net decrease (term loan extension fees of $11,034 were included in 2010) (10,984 ) $ 34,955 See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" discussion below for a detail of our borrower groups.
Gain on sale of affiliate interests of $683 and $2,051 for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, relate to the installment sale of our ownership interest in PVI Virtual Media Services LLC ("PVI").
Gain on investments, net for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010 of $37,384 and $109,813, respectively, consists primarily of the increase in the fair value of Comcast common stock owned by the Company.The effects of these gains are partially offset by the losses on the related equity derivative contracts, net described below.
(53) Table of Contents Gain (loss) on equity derivative contracts, net for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010 of $1,454 and $(72,044), respectively, consists of unrealized and realized gains and losses due to the change in fair value of the Company's equity derivative contracts relating to the Comcast common stock owned by the Company.The effects of these gains and losses are partially offset by the losses or gains on investment securities pledged as collateral, which are included in gain (loss) on investments, net discussed above.
Loss on interest rate swap contracts, net amounted to $7,973 and $85,013 for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.These interest rate swap contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on a portion of the Company's floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates.The losses on interest rate swap contracts are a result of a shift in the yield curve over the life of the swap contracts.
Loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs amounted to $92,692 and $110,049 for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.The 2011 amount represents amounts paid in excess of the aggregate principal amount to repurchase CSC Holdings senior notes due April 2012, April 2014 and June 2015 and related fees associated with the tender offers and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts related to such repurchases.The 2010 amount represents premiums paid to repurchase a portion of Cablevision senior notes due April 2012 and related fees associated with the tender offer and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to such repurchases.
Income tax expense of $184,436 for the year ended December31, 2011, reflected an effective tax rate of 44%.The Company recorded a tax benefit of $1,015 due to the impact of a change in the state rate used to measure deferred taxes.An increase in the valuation allowance relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards resulted in tax expense of $1,822.The Company recorded tax expense of $1,699, including accrued interest, related to uncertain tax positions.In addition, the exclusion of the pretax loss of an entity that is not consolidated for income tax purposes resulted in additional tax expense of $2,509.
The Company recorded income tax expense of $113,767 for the year ended December31, 2010, reflecting an effective tax rate of 35%.In the second quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a nonrecurring tax benefit of $18,951 for an increase in certain state and city net operating loss carry forwards pursuant to the finalization of an examination with a state taxing authority.Absent this tax benefit, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have been 41%.The Company recorded tax expense of $5,842 for the impact of a change in the state rate used to measure deferred taxes principally due to the impact of the MSG Distribution on February9, 2010.A decrease in the valuation allowance relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards resulted in a tax benefit of $2,428.The Company recorded tax expense of $1,202, including accrued interest, related to uncertain tax positions.
For the year ended December31, 2010, the Company has fully offset federal taxable income with a net operating loss carry forward.However, the Company is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and certain state and local income taxes that are payable quarterly.

The increase in advertising revenue is primarily due to the acquisition of our Bresnan Cable system as well as a general improvement in the cable television advertising market in 2011.The increase in Optimum Lightpath net revenues is primarily attributable to growth in Ethernet data services, partially offset by reduced traditional data services.
(56) Table of Contents The following table presents certain statistical information as of December31, 2011, September30, 2011 and December31, 2010 for our cable television systems in the New York metropolitan service area (excluding Optimum Lightpath) and the Optimum West service area: December31, 2011 September30, 2011 December31, 2010 New York Metropolitan Service Area Optimum West (a) Total New York Metropolitan Service Area Optimum West (a) Total New York Metropolitan Service Area Optimum West (a) Total (in thousands) Total customers 3,255 (b) 356 3,611 (b) 3,269 (b) 353 3,622 (b) 3,298 (b) 350 3,648 (b) Video customers 2,947 303 3,250 2,962 302 3,264 3,008 306 3,314 High-speed data customers 2,701 264 2,965 2,688 257 2,945 2,653 239 2,892 Voice customers 2,201 156 2,357 2,178 148 2,326 2,138 131 2,269 ______________ (a) Reflects data related to Bresnan Cable, which was acquired by the Company on December14, 2010.
(b) Reflects approximately 3 additional customers as a result of a revision in our statistical reporting in March 2011.
The Company had a loss of 60,300 basic video customers in the New York metropolitan service area for the year ended December31, 2011 compared to a loss of 55,500 in 2010.We believe our video subscriber losses are largely attributable to the continuing economic downturn and intense competition, particularly from Verizon.The length of the economic downturn and this intense competition could continue to impact our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future.
Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below) for 2011 increased $314,287 (13%) as compared to 2010.Excluding the impact of Bresnan Cable's technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization), such expenses increased $98,478 (4%) in 2011 as compared to 2010.The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in programming costs (including costs of on-demand services) primarily due to programming costs for the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system operations of $114,946, rate increases and new program offerings, partially offset by lower subscribers to certain tiers of video service $ 167,197 Adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to estimated programming costsrecorded inyears prior to 2011 resulting from the renewals of contracts that expired in previous years (42,900 ) Nonrecurring settlement of a contractual fee matter related to years prior to 2009 recorded in the second quarter 2010 23,000 Increase in field operations and network related costs primarily due to costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system of $74,632 and general cost increases primarily related to maintenance and insurance in the New York metropolitan service area 107,082 Increase in voice-related and other general costs, primarily due to costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system of $30,296.The increase in the New York metropolitan service area is primarily due to an increase in voice-related fees, termination and interconnection costs 44,541 Increase in employee overtime and repair costs attributable to two severe storms in the New York metropolitan service area 16,300 Nonrecurring contract termination charge related to the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system recorded in the fourth quarter 2010 (14,375 ) Increase in franchise fees primarily due to fees for the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system operations of $10,310, increase in revenues subject to franchise fees and higher rates in certain regions 13,400 Intra-segment eliminations 42 $ 314,287 Technical and operating expenses consist primarily of programming costs and direct costs associated with providing and maintaining services to our customers.These costs typically rise due to general inflationary cost increases for employees, contractors, programming rates, insurance and other various expenses.Certain of these costs are also variable based on the number of customers.Costs of field operations also increase as the portion of our expenses that we are able to capitalize decreases due to lower new customer installations and lower new service upgrades.Network related costs also fluctuate as capitalizable network upgrade and enhancement activity changes.Franchise fees are payable to the state governments and local municipalities where we operate and are primarily based on a percentage of certain categories of revenue, primarily video revenue, which vary by state and municipality.These costs change in relation to changes in such categories of revenues or rate changes.We expect that our technical and operating expenses will continue to increase in the future.
(57) Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $64,319 (6%) for 2011 as compared to 2010.Excluding the impact of Bresnan Cable's selling, general and administrative expenses, such expenses decreased $17,641 (2%) in 2011 as compared to 2010.The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in sales and marketing costs primarily due to costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired reversals and Bresnan Cable system of $35,670, and in the New York metropolitan service area higher employee and consumer incentiverelated costs, partially offset by lower costs related to program carriage disputes recorded in the first quarter 2010 $ 49,234 Decrease in expenses relating to long-term incentive plan awards to employees primarily due to accrual reversals and reductions in the fourth quarter of 2011 of $25,353 (see discussion below) (30,558 ) Increase in customer related costs, primarily due to costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system of $29,007, increased high-speed data and voice customers and general cost increases, partially offset by a decrease in customer related costs in the New York metropolitan service area primarily due to a reduction in call center labor costs due to fewer calls handled 19,217 Increase primarily in call center overtime costs attributable to two severe storms in the New York metropolitan service area 3,800 Other net increases primarily due to administrative costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system of $17,282, and the impact of insurance, legal, other fees and employee costs (including $3,236 of certain executiveseparation costsin the fourth quarter of 2011) in the New York metropolitan service area 22,587 Intra-segment eliminations 39 $ 64,319 Selling, general and administrative expenses include customer related costs, principally from the operation and maintenance of our call center facilities that handle customer inquiries and billing and collection activities.These costs generally rise as the number of customers grow and also as a result of general inflationary cost increases for employees and other various expenses.Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of employee costs and advertising production and placement costs associated with acquiring and retaining customers.These costs may vary period to period and may increase with intense competition.
The payment of long-term cash incentive awards is based on achievement of performance targets set at the time of the award. As a result of our current strategy to make additional investments designed to enhance our products and services with a focus on retention and acquisition of customers, these targets are not expected to be achieved for awards due to be paid in 2013 andexpected to beonly partially achieved for awards due to be paid in 2014. Accordingly, in 2011, the related accruals were reversed or substantially reduced.
Prior to the AMC Networks Distribution, the Telecommunications Services segment received a management fee calculated based on gross revenues of AMC and WEtv (as defined under the terms of the management agreement) on a monthly basis.Historically, these management fees were reported as a contra-expense and amounted to $13,958 for the year ended December31, 2011 (which represents management fees through June30, 2011) as compared to $26,511 for the year ended December31, 2010.The management agreement was terminated in connection with the AMC Networks Distribution and the fees received have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.
(58) Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization increased $118,618 (14%) for 2011 as compared to 2010.The net increase resulted primarily from depreciation and amortization related to the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system of $156,510 and depreciation of new asset purchases, offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated.
Adjusted operating cash flow increased $164,275 (7%) for the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to 2010.The increase was primarily due to adjusted operating cash flow related to the operations of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system of $145,632, and an increase in revenue, partially offset by an increase in both technical and operating and selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation, as discussed above.

(59) Table of Contents Newsday's other publications, which include amNew York and Star Community Publishing, are distributed for free. amNew York averaged weekday circulation of approximately 317,000 for the six months ended September25, 2011, a decrease of approximately 10% over the comparable prior year period.Star Community Publishing distributed approximately 1,851,000 copies each week (for the six months ended September25, 2011), a decrease of approximately 1% over the comparable prior year period.
Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below) for the year ended December31, 2011 decreased $9,558 (3%) as compared to the prior year.The net decrease is attributable to the following: Decrease in operating costs of PVI $ (5,486 ) Decrease in expenses at Newsday (from $187,606 to $183,508) primarily due to a decrease in production and distribution expenses, partially offset by an increase in newsprint and ink expenses (4,098 ) Other net increases 26 $ (9,558 ) Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December31, 2011 decreased $23,862 (7%) as compared to the prior year.The net decreases are attributable to the following: Decrease in unallocated Corporate costs due primarily to an increase in allocations to business units and a decrease in transaction costs related to the Bresnan acquisition of $8,879, which was consummated in December 2010 $ (16,057 ) Increase in unallocated Corporate costs primarily due to employee related costs (including $10,698 of certain executiveseparation costsin the fourth quarter of 2011) and an increase in legal and other professional fees 12,599 Decrease in expenses relating to long-term incentive plan awards to employees primarily due to accrual reversals andreductions in the fourth quarter of 2011 of $7,592, excluding Newsday,(see discussion below) (11,721 ) Decrease at Newsday (from $110,403 to $105,040) including a decrease of $3,494 in expenses relating to long-term incentive plan awards to employees primarily due to accrual reversals and reductions in the fourth quarter of 2011 of $2,629 (5,363 ) Other net decreases (1,846 ) Intra-segment eliminations (1,474 ) $ (23,862 ) For the year ended December31, 2011 and 2010, we allocated certain corporate overhead, including share-based compensation expense and expenses related to Cablevision's long-term incentive plans of $18,834 (through June30, 2011, the AMC Networks Distribution date), and $38,015, respectively, to AMC Networks.Such expenses were not eliminated as a result of the AMC Networks Distribution and have been reclassified to the Other segment for all periods presented.
The payment of long-term cash incentive awards is based on achievement of performance targets set at the time of the award. As a result of our current strategy to make additional investments designed to enhance our products and services with a focus on retention and acquisition of customers, these targets are not expected to be achieved for awards due to be paid in 2013 and expected to beonly partially achieved for awards due to be paid in 2014. Accordingly, in 2011, the related accruals were reversed or substantially reduced.
Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) for the year ended December31, 2011 increased $9,264 (15%) as compared to the prior year.The net increase is primarily due to depreciation of new asset purchases and an increase in impairment charges recorded at Newsday ($12,724 in 2011 and $7,800 in 2010), partially offset by decreases in depreciation due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated.
(60) Table of Contents Adjusted operating cash flow deficit decreased $6,840 (3%) for the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to 2010 (including Newsday's AOCF of $7,237 in 2011 compared to AOCF of $19,349 in 2010).The increase for the twelve month period was due primarily to decreases in revenues, net, partially offset by decreases in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation, as discussed above.

(64) Table of Contents We believe the increase in advertising revenue is primarily due to a general improvement in the cable television advertising market and political advertising in 2010.The increase in Optimum Lightpath net revenues is primarily attributable to growth in Ethernet data services, partially offset by reduced traditional data services and lower intra-segment revenue.
The following table presents certain statistical information as for our cable television systems in the New York metropolitan service area (excluding Optimum Lightpath) and the Optimum West service area as of December 31, 2010: December31, 2010 New York Metropolitan Service Area Optimum West (a) Total September30, 2010 December31, 2009 (in thousands) Total customers 3,298 (a) 350 3,648 (a) 3,321 3,314 Video customers 3,008 306 3,314 3,043 3,063 High-speed data customers 2,653 239 2,892 2,647 2,568 Voice customers 2,138 131 2,269 2,129 2,052 ______________ (a) Reflects data related to Bresnan Cable, which was acquired by the Company on December14, 2010.
Total RGUs as of December31, 2010, include 880,900 RGUs related to the acquisition of our Bresnan Cable system in December 2010.
Excluding the impact of the Bresnan Cable system, the Company had a loss of 55,500 video customers for the year ended December31, 2010 compared to a loss of 45,100 in 2009.This is largely attributable to the impact of a retransmission consent dispute in October 2010, the economic downturn, and, to a lesser extent, intense competition, particularly from Verizon.
For the year ended December31, 2010, excluding the impact of the Bresnan Cable system, the Company added 128,600 RGUs as compared to 297,700 in 2009.These additions include increases in digital video customers of approximately 40,500 and 50,600 for the years ended 2010 and 2009, respectively, resulting from the migration from analog to full digital across certain regions of our service area.The length of the economic downturn, along with intense competition, could impact our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future.
(65) Table of Contents Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below) for 2010 increased $134,460 (6%) as compared to 2009.The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in programming costs (including costs of on-demand services) due primarily to rate increases (see discussion of MSG networks below), new program offerings and programming costs for the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system operations ($5,662), partially offset by lower subscribers to certain tiers of service $ 88,206 Nonrecurring settlement of a contractual fee matter related to years prior to 2009 recorded in the second quarter of 2010 (23,000 ) Increase in field operations and network related costs primarily due to lower capitalizable activities, general cost increases, costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system ($5,003), and growth in RGUs 31,417 Nonrecurring contract termination charge related to the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system 14,375 Increase in franchise fees due to increase in video revenues and higher rates in certain regions 8,239 Impact of accrual reversals in 2009 due to legislative changes which clarified the applicability of certain VoIP fees 18,976 Lower termination rates, partially offset by higher interconnection costs due to the favorable resolution of certain disputed costs in 2009 (termination and interconnection costs are net of related intra-segment eliminations) (3,532 ) Intra-segment eliminations (221 ) $ 134,460 Technical and operating expenses consist primarily of programming costs and direct costs associated with providing and maintaining services to our customers.These costs typically rise as the number of RGUs grow and also due to general inflationary cost increases for employees, contractors, programming rates and other various expenses.Costs of field operations also increase as the portion of our expenses that we are able to capitalize decreases due to lower new customer installations and lower new service upgrades.Network related costs also fluctuate as capitalizable network upgrade and enhancement activity changes.Franchise fees are payable to the state governments and local municipalities where we operate and are based on a percentage of certain categories of revenue, primarily video revenue which vary by state and municipality.These costs change in relation to changes in such categories of revenues or rate changes.We expect that our technical and operating expenses will continue to increase in the future.However, as a percentage of revenues, we expect these costs to remain relatively constant.
Effective January1, 2010, a new long-term affiliation agreement was entered into between Cablevision and the MSG networks, which are owned by Madison Square Garden.This new long-term affiliation agreement resulted in incremental programming costs to the Company of approximately $29,000 for the year ended December31, 2010, as compared to the amount of programming costs recognized by the Company pursuant to the Company's arrangement with Madison Square Garden in 2009.This new affiliation agreement provides for the carriage of the MSG Network and MSG Plus program services on the Company's cable television systems in the tri-state area.This agreement has a term of 10years, obligates the Company to carry the MSG networks program services on its cable television systems and provides for the payment by the Company to the MSG networks of a per subscriber license fee, which fee is increased each year during the term of the agreement.
(66) Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $45,256 (4%) for 2010 as compared to 2009.The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in sales and marketing costs primarily due to increased customer promotions, higher commissions, higher advertising costs, including costs related to program carriage disputes, and costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system ($2,003) $ 22,283 Impact of the favorable resolution of litigation, that resulted in a reversal of expense recognized in prior periods, recorded in 2009 5,579 Decrease in customer related costs in the New York metropolitan service area primarily due to a reduction in call center labor costs due to fewer calls handled, partially offset by increased RGUs and general cost increases (3,937 ) Increase in share-based compensation expense and expenses relating to Cablevision's long-term incentive plans 8,087 Other net increases primarily due to legal costs, other fees and employee costs in the New York metropolitan service area and administrative costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system ($2,244) 13,471 Intra-segment eliminations (227 ) $ 45,256 Selling, general and administrative expenses include customer related costs, principally from the operation and maintenance of our call center facilities that handle customer inquiries and billing and collection activities.These costs generally rise as the number of RGUs grow and also as a result of general inflationary cost increases for employees and other various expenses.Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of employee costs and advertising production and placement costs associated with acquiring and retaining customers.These costs may increase with intense competition.
Prior to the AMC Networks Distribution, the Telecommunications Services segment received a management fee calculated based on gross revenues of AMC and WEtv (as defined under the terms of the management agreement) on a monthly basis.Historically, these management fees were reported as a contra-expense and amounted to $26,511 and $23,773, for the year ended December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.The management agreement was terminated in connection with the AMC Networks Distribution and the fees received have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Depreciation and amortization decreased $32,890 (4%) for 2010 as compared to 2009.The net decrease resulted primarily from certain assets becoming fully depreciated, partially offset by depreciation of new asset purchases and depreciation and amortization of $6,791 related to the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system.
Adjusted operating cash flow increased $127,443 (6%) for the year ended December31, 2010 as compared to 2009.The increase was due to an increase in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation, as discussed above.The year ended 2010 increase includes the $23,000 nonrecurring settlement of a contractual fee matter related to years prior to 2009 recorded in 2010, partially offset by a $14,375 nonrecurring contract termination charge related to the Bresnan Cable system.The increase in 2010 was also negatively impacted by the reversal of an accrual in 2009 due to legislative changes which clarified the applicability of certain VoIP fees of $18,976 and the impact of the favorable resolution of litigation that resulted in a reversal of expense recognized in prior periods recorded in 2009 of $5,579.

Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) for the year ended December31, 2010 increased $3,574 (6%) as compared to the prior year.The net increase is primarily due to an impairment charge recorded at Newsday of $7,800 in 2010 relating to the estimated fair value of Newsday's indefinite-lived intangible trademark, as compared to $2,000 in the prior year, and depreciation of new asset purchases, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated and a decrease in depreciation expense of $4,025 related to two Newsday printing presses that were phased out of service in mid-year 2009.
Restructuring expense for the year ended December31, 2009 amounted to $5,583.This is comprised of $3,590 in severance and other related costs associated with the elimination of 98 staff positions and $3,174 related to a lease modification termination penalty and other lease and contract exit costs at Newsday.Offsetting these expenses are restructuring credits of $1,181 related to adjustments in severance and facility realignment provisions recorded in prior restructuring plans.
Adjusted operating cash flow deficit increased $31,583 (18%) for the year ended December31, 2010 as compared to 2009 (including AOCF of Newsday of $19,349 and $21,775 in 2010 and 2009, respectively).The increase was due primarily to a decrease in revenues, net, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation, as discussed above.

(74) Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cablevision Cablevision has no operations independent of its subsidiaries.Cablevision's outstanding securities consist of CNYG ClassA common stock, CNYG ClassB common stock and approximately $2,931,000 of debt securities, including approximately $2,177,000 face value of debt securities held by third party investors and approximately $754,000 held by Newsday Holdings LLC.The $754,000 of notes are eliminated in Cablevision's consolidated financial statements and are shown as notes due from Cablevision in the consolidated equity of CSC Holdings.
Funding for the Company's Debt Service Requirements Funding for the debt service requirements of our debt securities is provided by our subsidiaries' operations, principally CSC Holdings, as permitted by the covenants governing CSC Holdings' credit agreements and indentures.Funding for our subsidiaries is generally provided by cash flow from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under credit facilities made available to the Restricted Group (as later defined) and Bresnan Cable, and the proceeds from the issuance of securities in the capital markets.Our decision as to the use of cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under credit facilities of the Restricted Group and Bresnan Cable will be based upon an ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, the timing of cash flow generation and the cost of borrowing under each respective credit agreement.Moreover, we will monitor the credit markets and may seek opportunities to issue debt, the proceeds of which could be used to meet our future cash funding requirements.The Company has accessed the debt markets for significant amounts of capital in the past and may do so in the future.
We have assessed the implications of the volatility in the capital and credit markets on our ability to repay our scheduled debt maturities over the next 12months and we currently believe that a combination of cash-on-hand, cash generated from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facilities should provide us with sufficient liquidity to repay such scheduled current debt maturities in the next 12months totaling approximately $208,681 under our credit facilities, senior notes and notes payable as of December31, 2011.However, additional market disruptions could cause broader economic downturns, which may lead to lower demand for our products, such as cable television services, as well as lower levels of television and newspaper advertising, and increased incidence of customers' inability to pay for the services we provide.These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.Although we currently believe that amounts available under our CSC Holdings and Bresnan Cable revolving credit facilities will be available when, and if needed, we can provide no assurance that access to such funds will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.The obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facilities are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others.
In the longer term, we do not expect to be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund anticipated capital expenditures, meet all existing future contractual payment obligations and repay our debt at maturity.As a result, we will be dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets.We will need to raise significant amounts of funding over the next several years to fund capital expenditures, repay existing obligations and meet other obligations, and the failure to do so successfully could adversely affect our business.If we are unable to do so, we will need to take other actions including deferring capital expenditures, selling assets, seeking strategic investments from third parties or reducing or eliminating dividend payments and stock repurchases or other discretionary uses of cash.

Interest Rate Swaps As of December31, 2011, CSC Holdings was party to several interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $2,600,000 that effectively fixed borrowing rates on a portion of the Company's floating rate debt.These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.As a result of the CSC Holdings interest rate swap transactions, the interest rate paid on approximately 81% of the Company's outstanding debt (excluding capital leases and collateralized indebtedness) is effectively fixed (56% being fixed rate obligations and 25% is effectively fixed through utilization of these interest rate swap contracts) as of December31, 2011.The table below summarizes certain terms of these interest rate swap contracts as of December31, 2011: Maturity Date Notional Amount Weighted Average Fixed Rate Paid by the Company Weighted Average Effective Floating Rate Received by the Company at December31, 2011 * June 2012 $2,600,000 4.86% 0.54% ______________ * Represents the weighted average effective floating rate received by the Company under its interest rate swap contracts at December31, 2011 and does not represent the rates to be received by the Company on future payments.
Bresnan Cable Credit Facility Debt We currently expect that net funding and investment requirements for Bresnan Cable for the next 12months will be met with one or more of the following: cash on hand, cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under its credit facility.
Bresnan Cable has an $840,000 senior secured credit facility which is comprised of two components : a $765,000 term loan facility and a $75,000 revolving loan facility (collectively, the "Bresnan Credit Agreement").In connection with the financing of the Bresnan acquisition in December 2010, the full $765,000 amount of the term loan facility was drawn, net of an original issue discount of approximately $7,700. The revolving loan facility, which includes a $25,000 sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $5,000 sublimit for swingline loans, was not drawn in connection with the transaction. Such revolving loan facility is expected to be available to provide for ongoing working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Borrowings under the Bresnan Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate, which at the option of Bresnan Cable may be either 2.0% over a floating base rate or 3.0% over an adjusted LIBOR rate, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.50%. The Bresnan Credit Agreement requires Bresnan Cable to pay a commitment fee of 0.75% in respect of the average daily unused commitments under the revolving loan facility. Bresnan Cable is also required to pay customary letter of credit fees, as well as fronting fees, to banks that issue letters of credit pursuant to the Bresnan Credit Agreement.
(82) Table of Contents All obligations under the Bresnan Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Holdings Sub (the direct parent of Bresnan Cable) and each of Bresnan Cable's existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries in accordance with the Bresnan Credit Agreement (the "Guarantors"). All obligations under the Bresnan Credit Agreement, including the guarantees of those obligations, will be secured by certain assets of the Bresnan Cable and the Guarantors, including a pledge of the equity interests of Bresnan Cable.
Bresnan Cable may voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the Bresnan Credit Agreement at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (except for customary breakage costs with respect to Eurodollar loans, if applicable).If Bresnan Cable makes a prepayment of term loans in connection with certain refinancing transactions, Bresnan Cable must pay a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the amount of term loans prepaid.
With certain exceptions, Bresnan Cable is required to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances, including (i)a specified percentage of excess cash flow beginning in 2012 depending on its cash flow ratio, (ii)from the net cash proceeds of certain sales of assets (subject to reinvestment rights), (iii)from casualty insurance and/or condemnation proceeds, and (iv)upon the incurrence of certain indebtedness.
The term loan facility requires remaining quarterly repayments of $1,913 from 2012 through September 2017, and $713,363 on December14, 2017, the maturity date of the termloan facility.Any amounts outstanding under the revolving loan facility are due at maturity on December14, 2015.
The Bresnan Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also requires Bresnan Cable to comply with the following financial covenants: (i)a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to operating cash flow (as defined) of 7.75:1 decreasing periodically to 5.00:1 on March31, 2014; (ii)a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense of 2.00:1 increasing periodically to 2.75:1 on March31, 2014, and (iii)minimum liquidity (as defined) of $25,000 .
Bresnan Cable was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its credit agreement as of December31, 2011.
Newsday LLC We currently expect that net funding and investment requirements for Newsday LLC for the next 12months will be met with one or more of the following: cash on hand, cash generated by operating activities, interest income from the Cablevision senior notes held by Newsday Holdings LLC, capital contributions and intercompany advances.
NewsdayLLC's $650,000 senior secured loan facility is comprised of two components: a $525,000 10.50% fixed rate term loan facility and a $125,000 floating rate term loan facility.The senior secured loan facility matures on August1, 2013 and, subject to certain exceptions, requires mandatory prepayments out of the proceeds of certain sales of property or assets, insurance proceeds and debt and equity issuances.No mandatory prepayments were required prior to July29, 2011, and the amount of prepayments thereafter are limited to $105,000 in the aggregate prior to July29, 2012 and $140,000 in the aggregate prior to the maturity date.Optional prepayments are also permitted, subject to specified prepayment premiums.
(83) Table of Contents The principal financial covenant for the senior secured loan facility is a minimum liquidity test of $25,000, which is tested bi-annually on June30 and December31.The senior secured loan facility also contains other affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including limitations on indebtedness (other than permitted senior indebtedness (as defined) not exceeding $50,000 and permitted subordinated indebtedness (as defined) to be used for investments not to exceed $100,000), investments (other than investments out of excess cash flow and out of the proceeds of the Cablevision senior notes in excess of the outstanding borrowings and out of a $40,000 basket), and dividends and other restricted payments (other than in respect of management and guarantee fees and restricted payments out of excess cash flow and out of the proceeds of the Cablevision senior notes in excess of the outstanding borrowings).Certain of the covenants applicable to CSC Holdings under the Newsday LLC senior secured loan facility are similar to the covenants applicable to CSC Holdings under its outstanding senior notes.
Borrowings by Newsday LLC under its senior secured loan facility are guaranteed by Newsday Holdings LLC, NMG Holdings, Inc. and CSC Holdings on a senior unsecured basis and secured by a lien on the assets of Newsday LLC, and the Cablevision senior notes receivable held by Newsday Holdings LLC.Newsday LLC will generally be prohibited from using the proceeds received from any repayment of the Cablevision senior notes contributed to Newsday Holdings LLC by CSC Holdings to acquire non-publicly traded notes or debt instruments of Cablevision or CSC Holdings, and Newsday LLC will be required under its senior secured loan facility to maintain cash or cash equivalents or publicly traded notes or debt instruments of Cablevision or CSC Holdings with an aggregate principal amount that exceeds the then-outstanding borrowings by NewsdayLLC under its senior secured loan facility.
Newsday LLC was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its credit agreement as of December31, 2011.

Managing our Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk Interest Rate Risk To manage interest rate risk, we have entered into various interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable interest rates.Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates.We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes.We monitor the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and we only enter into interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions that are rated investment grade.We diversify our swap contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution.
Interest rate risk is primarily a result of exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates and credit spreads.
All interest rate swap contracts are carried at their fair values on our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in value reflected in our consolidated statements of income.
Equity Price Risk We have entered into derivative contracts to hedge our equity price risk and monetize the value of our shares of common stock of Comcast Corporation.These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price.If any one of these contracts is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date due to the occurrence of an event specified in the contract, we would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date.As of December31, 2011, we did not have an early termination shortfall relating to any of these contracts.The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value.
(88) Table of Contents See "Item7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for information on how we participate in changes in the market price of the stocks underlying these derivative contracts.
All of our monetization transactions are obligations of our wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not part of the Restricted Group; however, CSC Holdings provides guarantees of the subsidiaries' ongoing contract payment expense obligations and potential payments that could be due as a result of an early termination event (as defined in the agreements).The guarantee exposure approximates the net sum of the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and the equity collar.All of our equity derivative contracts are carried at their current fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in value reflected in our consolidated statements of income, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic350):Testing Goodwill for Impairment.ASU No.2011-08 is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a "qualitative" assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary.ASU No.2011-08 was effective for the Company on January1, 2012.
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No.2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic820):Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.ASU No.2011-04 provides amendments to Topic820 that change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements.ASU No.2011-04 is to be applied prospectively and was effective for the Company on January1, 2012.
Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk All dollar amounts, except per subscriber, per unit and per share data, included in the following discussion under this Item7A are presented in thousands.
Equity Price Risk The Company is exposed to market risks from changes in certain equity security prices.Our exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the shares of Comcast Corporation common stock held by us.We have entered into equity derivative contracts consisting of a collateralized loan and an equity collar to hedge our equity price risk and to monetize the value of these securities.These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price.The contracts' actual hedge prices per share vary depending on average stock prices in effect at the time the contracts were executed.The contracts' actual cap prices vary depending on the maturity and terms of each contract, among other factors.If any one of these contracts is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date due to the occurrence of an event specified in the contract, we would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date.As of December31, 2011, we did not have an early termination shortfall relating to any of these contracts.
(89) Table of Contents The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value.The carrying value of our collateralized indebtedness amounted to $455,938 at December31, 2011.At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of Comcast common stock, with a value determined by reference to the applicable stock price at maturity.
As of December31, 2011, the fair value and the carrying value of our holdings of Comcast common stock aggregated $509,234.Assuming a 10% change in price, the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately $50,923.As of December31, 2011, the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the equity derivative contracts entered into to partially hedge the equity price risk of our holdings of Comcast common stock aggregated $4,364, a net payable position.For the year ended December31, 2011, we recorded a net gain on our outstanding equity derivative contracts of $1,454 and recorded unrealized gains of $37,371 on our holdings of Comcast common stock that we held during the period.
Fair Value of Equity Derivative Contracts Fair value as of December31, 2010, net payable position $ (59,300 ) Change in fair value, net 1,454 Settlement of contracts 53,482 Fair value as of December31, 2011, net payable position $ (4,364 ) The maturity, number of shares deliverable at the relevant maturity, hedge price per share, and the lowest and highest cap prices received for each security monetized via an equity derivative prepaid forward contract are summarized in the following table: # of Shares Hedge Price Cap Price (b) Security Deliverable Maturity per Share (a) Low High Comcast 8,069,934 2012 $ 17.57 - $18.85 $ 21.09 $ 22.62 13,407,684 2013 $ 20.52 - $24.94 $ 24.63 $ 29.92 ______________ (a) Represents the price below which we are provided with downside protection and above which we retain upside appreciation. Also represents the price used in determining the cash proceeds payable to us at inception of the contracts.
(b) Represents the price up to which we receive the benefit of stock price appreciation.
Fair Value of Debt :Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at December31, 2011, the fair value of our fixed rate debt of $7,749,426 was more than its carrying value of $7,207,560 by $541,866.The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities.Our floating rate borrowings bear interest in reference to current LIBOR-based market rates and thus their carrying values approximate fair value.The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December31, 2011 would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by $364,768 to $8,114,194.This estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities.
Interest Rate Swap Contracts :Our exposure to interest rate movements results from our use of floating and fixed rate debt to fund the approximately $3billion special dividend paid in 2006, our working capital, capital expenditures, and other operational and investment requirements.To manage interest rate risk, from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates.Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates and/or effectively convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to permit the Company to realize lower interest expense in a declining interest rate environment.We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes.The Company monitors the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and we only enter into interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions that are rated investment grade. We diversify our swap contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution.All such contracts are carried at their fair values on our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value reflected in our consolidated statements of income.
(90) Table of Contents As of December31, 2011, CSC Holdings was party to several interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $2,600,000 that effectively fixed borrowing rates on a portion of the Company's floating rate debt.As of December31, 2011, our outstanding interest rate swap contracts had a fair value and carrying value of $55,383, a net liability position, as reflected under liabilities under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet.Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December31, 2011 would increase our liability under these derivative contracts by approximately $3,313 to a liability of $58,696.
For the year ended December31, 2011, we recorded a net loss on interest swap contracts of $7,973, as detailed in the table below: Fair Value of Interest Rate Swap Contracts Fair value as of December31, 2010, a net liability position $ (167,278 ) Cash payments, net 119,868 Change in fair value, net (7,973 ) Fair value as of December31, 2011, a net liability position $ (55,383 ) Item 8.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of Cablevision's management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under SEC rules).Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2011.
(91) Table of Contents Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's external financial statements, including estimates and judgments, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Therefore, even those internal controls determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
The Company's management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011.
Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation reports appearing on pagesI-1, I-2, I-3 and I-4.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Cablevision Systems Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Cablevision Systems Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' deficiency, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011, and our report dated February28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, RELATED MATTERS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Company and Related Matters Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision"), its wholly-owned subsidiary CSC Holdings, LLC ("CSC Holdings," and collectively with Cablevision, the "Company") and their subsidiaries own and operate cable television systems and own companies that provide regional news, other programming and advertising sales services for the cable television industry, provide telephone service, operate motion picture theatres and operate a newspaper publishing business.The Company classifies its operations into two reportable segments:(1)Telecommunications Services, consisting principally of its video, high-speed data, Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") and its commercial data and voice services operations; and (2)Other, consisting principally of (i)Newsday, which includes the Newsday daily newspaper, amNew York, Star Community Publishing Group, and online websites including newsday.com and exploreLI.com, (ii)a motion picture theatre business ("Clearview Cinemas"), (iii)the News12 Networks, which provides regional news programming services, (iv)the MSG Varsity network, a network dedicated entirely to showcasing high school sports and activities, (v)a cable television advertising company, Cablevision Media Sales Corporation ("Cablevision Media Sales"), previously known as Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation, and (vi)certain other businesses and unallocated corporate costs.
On February9, 2010, Cablevision distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of The Madison Square Garden Company ("Madison Square Garden"), a company which owns the sports, entertainment and media businesses previously owned and operated by the Company's Madison Square Garden segment (the "MSG Distribution").The MSG Distribution took the form of a distribution by Cablevision of one share of Madison Square Garden ClassA Common Stock for every four shares of Cablevision NY Group ("CNYG") ClassA Common Stock held of record at the close of business in New York City on January25, 2010 (the "MSG Distribution Record Date") and one share of Madison Square Garden ClassB Common Stock for every four shares of CNYG ClassB Common Stock held of record on the MSG Distribution Record Date.As a result of the MSG Distribution, the Company no longer consolidates the financial results of Madison Square Garden for the purpose of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of Madison Square Garden have been reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the MSG Distribution date.
On June30, 2011, Cablevision distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of AMC Networks Inc., formerly Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, ("AMC Networks"), a company which consists principally of national programming networks, including AMC, WE tv, IFC and Sundance Channel, previously owned and operated by the Company's Rainbow segment (the "AMC Networks Distribution").The AMC Networks Distribution took the form of a distribution by Cablevision of one share of AMC Networks ClassA Common Stock for every four shares of Cablevision NY Group ("CNYG") ClassA Common Stock held of record on June16, 2011 (the "AMC Networks Distribution Record Date") and one share of AMC Networks ClassB Common Stock for every four shares of CNYG ClassB Common Stock held of record on the AMC Networks Distribution Record Date.As a result of the AMC Networks Distribution, the Company no longer consolidates the financial results of AMC Networks for the purpose of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of AMC Networks have been reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the AMC Networks Distribution date.
I-22 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Assets and liabilities related to the AMC Networks Distribution on the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2010 and related footnotes have been reclassified as assets distributed to stockholders/sole member in 2011 and liabilities distributed to stockholders/sole member in 2011.All assets and liabilities distributed to stockholders/sole member in 2011 are excluded from the footnotes unless otherwise noted.
Accounts due to or due from Madison Square Garden and AMC Networks that were previously eliminated in consolidation are now presented as amounts due to affiliates or amounts due from affiliates on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Cablevision include the accounts of Cablevision and its majority-owned subsidiaries and the accompanying consolidated financial statements of CSC Holdings include the accounts of CSC Holdings and its majority-owned subsidiaries.Cablevision has no business operations independent of its CSC Holdings subsidiary, whose operating results and financial position are consolidated into Cablevision.The consolidated balance sheets and statements of income for Cablevision are essentially identical to the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income for CSC Holdings, with the following significant exceptions:Cablevision has $2,166,966 of senior notes outstanding at December31, 2011 (excluding the $753,717 aggregate principal amount of Cablevision senior notes held by its subsidiary Newsday Holdings LLC discussed in Note 11) that were issued to third party investors, cash, deferred financing costs and accrued interest related to its senior notes, deferred taxes and accrued dividends on its balance sheet and CSC Holdings and its subsidiaries have certain intercompany receivables from Cablevision.
Differences between Cablevision's results of operations from those of CSC Holdings primarily include incremental interest expense, interest income, loss on extinguishment of debt, write-off of deferred financing costs, and income tax expense or benefit .
CSC Holdings' results of operations include incremental interest income from the Cablevision senior notes held by Newsday Holdings LLC and the accretion of the discount on the 8% senior notes due 2012 issued by Cablevision to Newsday Holdings LLC that were redeemed during the second quarter of 2010 (which were replaced with the $753,717 aggregate principal amount of Cablevision notes discussed in Note 11), all of which eliminate in Cablevision's results of operations.
The combined notes to the consolidated financial statements relate to the Company, which, except as noted, are essentially identical for Cablevision and CSC Holdings.All significant intercompany transactions and balances between Cablevision and CSC Holdings and their respective consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated in both sets of consolidated financial statements.Intercompany transactions between Cablevision and CSC Holdings do not eliminate in the CSC Holdings consolidated financial statements, but do eliminate in the Cablevision consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates.See Note 13 for a discussion on fair value estimates.

NOTE 2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes video, high-speed data, VoIP, and telephony revenues as the services are provided to subscribers.Installation revenue for the Company's video, consumer high-speed data and VoIP services is recognized as installations are completed, as direct selling costs have exceeded this revenue in all periods reported.Advertising revenues are recognized when commercials are aired.
The Company's Newsday business recognizes publication advertising revenue when advertisements are published.Newsday recognizes circulation revenue for single copy sales as newspapers are distributed, net of returns.Proceeds from advance billings for home-delivery subscriptions are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue on a pro-rata basis over the term of the subscriptions.
Revenues derived from other sources are recognized when services are provided or events occur.
Multiple-Element Transactions On January1, 2011, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No.2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, which was applicable on a prospective basis to revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after January1, 2011.ASU No.2009-13 eliminates the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration to deliverables, requires the use of the relative selling price method and requires that the Company determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis.
For revenue arrangements entered into prior to January1, 2011, the Company allocated the arrangement consideration to the separate elements of accounting based on relative fair values, if there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all elements of accounting in a multiple-element arrangement.There may be cases in which there was objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items in an arrangement but no such evidence for the delivered items.In those cases, the Company utilized the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration.Under the residual method, the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered items equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items.In determining fair value, the Company referred to historical transactions or comparable cash transactions.
Gross Versus Net Revenue Recognition In the normal course of business, the Company is assessed non-income related taxes by governmental authorities, including franchising authorities, and collects such taxes from its customers.The Company's policy is that, in instances where the tax is being assessed directly on the Company, amounts paid to the governmental authorities and amounts received from the customers are recorded on a gross basis.That is, amounts paid to the governmental authorities are recorded as technical and operating expenses and amounts received from the customer are recorded as revenues.For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the amount of franchise fees included as a component of net revenue aggregated $147,498, $134,730, and $127,716, respectively.
I-24 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Technical and Operating Expenses Costs of revenue related to sales of services are classified as "technical and operating" expenses in the accompanying statements of income.
Programming Costs Programming expenses for the Company's cable television business included in the Telecommunications Services segment relate to fees paid to programming distributors to license the programming distributed to subscribers.This programming is acquired generally under multi-year distribution agreements, with rates usually based on the number of subscribers that receive the programming.There have been periods when an existing affiliation agreement has expired and the parties have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time.In substantially all these instances, the Company continues to carry and pay for these services until execution of definitive replacement agreements or renewals.The amount of programming expense recorded during this interim period is based on the Company's estimates of the ultimate contractual agreement expected to be reached, which is based on several factors, including previous contractual rates, customary rate increases and the current status of negotiations.Such estimates are adjusted as negotiations progress until new programming terms are finalized.
In addition, the Company's cable television business has received, or may receive, incentives from programming distributors for carriage of the distributors' programming.The Company generally recognizes these incentives as a reduction of programming costs in technical and operating expense, generally over the term of the programming agreement.
Advertising Expenses Advertising costs are charged to expense when incurred and are recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of income.Advertising costs amounted to $177,694, $164,314 and $157,777 for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the fair value of the portion of share-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
For options and performance based option awards, Cablevision recognizes compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model using a straight-line amortization method.For restricted shares and restricted stock units, Cablevision recognizes compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method, based on the grant date price of CNYG ClassA common stock over the vesting period, except for restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors which vest 100% and are expensed at the date of grant.For stock appreciation rights, Cablevision recognizes compensation expense based on the estimated fair value at each reporting period using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
I-25 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) For CSC Holdings, share-based compensation expense is recognized in its statements of income for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 based on allocations from Cablevision.
Income Taxes The Company's provision for income taxes is based on current period income, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in estimates with regard to uncertain tax positions.Deferred tax assets are subject to an ongoing assessment of realizability.The Company provides deferred taxes for the outside basis difference of its investment in partnerships.Interest and penalties, if any, associated with uncertain tax positions are included in income tax expense.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company's cash investments are placed with money market funds and financial institutions that are investment grade as rated by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service.The Company selects money market funds that predominantly invest in marketable, direct obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States government or its agencies, commercial paper, fully collateralized repurchase agreements, certificates of deposit, and time deposits.
The Company considers the balance of its investment in funds that substantially hold securities that mature within three months or less from the date the fund purchases these securities to be cash equivalents.The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents either approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments or are at fair value.
Restricted Cash Restricted cash principally includes money market securities held in a rabbi trust established in December 2011 to fund deferred compensation payments as required under certain employment agreements.
Accounts Receivable The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of valuation allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable by evaluating the collectibility of outstanding receivables and general factors such as historical collection experience, length of time individual receivables are past due, and the economic and competitive environment.
Investments Investment securities and investment securities pledged as collateral are classified as trading securities and are stated at fair value with realized and unrealized holding gains and losses included in net income.
Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including construction materials, are carried at cost, and include all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the construction of cable television transmission and distribution systems, and the costs of new product and subscriber installations.Equipment under capital leases is recorded at the present value of the total minimum lease payments.Depreciation on equipment is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, with respect to equipment under capital leases and leasehold improvements, amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the assets' useful lives and reported in depreciation and amortization (including impairments) in the consolidated statements of income.
I-26 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) The Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or develop internal-use software.Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software and reported in depreciation and amortization.
Intangible assets established in connection with acquisitions consist of primarily customer relationships, advertiser relationships, other intangibles, and goodwill.These intangible assets are amortized in a manner that reflects the pattern in which the projected net cash inflows to the Company are expected to occur, such as the sum of the years' digits method, or when such pattern does not exist, using the straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.Goodwill and the value of franchises, trademarks, licenses and certain other intangibles acquired in purchase business combinations which have indefinite useful lives are not amortized.
The Company reviews its long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization that arose from acquisitions) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process.The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill utilizing an enterprise-value based premise approach.If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any.The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill which would be recognized in a business combination.
Effective January 1, 2011, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2010-28, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts.ASU No. 2010-28 modified Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
The impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value.If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
I-27 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred to obtain debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value.The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market risks from changes in certain equity prices and interest rates and does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges, and changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings as gains (losses) on derivative contracts.
Commitments and Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when the Company believes it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated.

Income (Loss) Per Common Share Cablevision Basic net income per common share attributable to Cablevision stockholders is computed by dividing net income attributable to Cablevision stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.Diluted net income per common share attributable to Cablevision stockholders reflects the dilutive effects of stock options and restricted stock (including stock options and restricted stock held by AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden employees).
I-30 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) A reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share attributable to Cablevision stockholders calculation for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010 is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (in thousands) Basic weighted average shares outstanding 276,369 293,165 291,759 Effect of dilution: Stock options 3,320 3,181 2,483 Restricted stock awards 5,215 5,534 4,202 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 284,904 301,880 298,444 Anti-dilutive shares (options whose exercise price exceeds the average market price of Cablevision's common stock during the period and certain restricted shares) totaling approximately 303,000, 237,000 and 1,736,000 (which include Company options held by AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden employees), have been excluded from diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the years ended December31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively.In addition 193,000 restricted shares issued pursuant to the Company's employee stock plan have been excluded from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2011 as the performance criteria on these awards have not yet been satisfied.
CSC Holdings Net income (loss) per membership unit for CSC Holdings is not presented since CSC Holdings is a limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision.
Comprehensive Income (Loss) In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220):Presentation of Comprehensive Income.The main provisions of ASU No. 2011-05 provide that an entity that reports items of other comprehensive income has the option to present comprehensive income as (i) a single statement that presents the components of net income and total net income, the components of other comprehensive income and total other comprehensive income, and a total for comprehensive income or (ii) in a two-statement approach, whereby an entity must present the components of net income and total net income in the first statement and that statement is immediately followed by a financial statement that presents the components of other comprehensive income, a total for other comprehensive income, and a total for comprehensive income.The option in current GAAP that permits the presentation of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity has been eliminated.ASU No.2011-05 is to be applied retrospectively.The Company has early adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2011-05 during the fourth quarter of 2011 and has opted to present comprehensive income in a two-statement approach.
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.ASU No. 2011-12 defers only those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented on the face of the financial statements.All other requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 are not affected by ASU No. 2011-12, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements.The Company has deferred the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as required by ASU No. 2011-05.
I-31 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that may potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade account receivables.The Company monitors the financial institutions and money market funds where it invests its cash and cash equivalents with diversification among counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution.The Company's emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and liquidity and secondarily on maximizing the yield on its investments.The Company did not have a single customer that represented 10% or more of its consolidated net revenues for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, or 10% or more of its consolidated net trade receivables at December31, 2011 and 2010.

TRANSACTIONS 2010 Transactions Acquisition of Bresnan Cable On December14, 2010, BBHI Holdings LLC ("Holdings Sub"), BBHI Acquisition LLC ("Acquisition Sub") and CSC Holdings, each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision, consummated the merger contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Holdings Sub, Acquisition Sub, CSC Holdings, Bresnan Broadband Holdings, LLC ("Bresnan Cable") and Providence Equity Bresnan Cable LLC dated June13, 2010 (the "Merger Agreement").Acquisition Sub merged with and into Bresnan Cable, with Bresnan Cable being the surviving entity, and becoming a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings Sub and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision and CSC Holdings.The purchase price was $1,364,276.The acquisition was financed using an equity contribution by CSC Holdings of $395,000 (which CSC Holdings borrowed under its revolving loan facility) and debt consisting of an undrawn $75,000 revolving loan facility, a $765,000 term loan facility and $250,000 8.0% senior notes due 2018.
For income tax purposes, the acquisition was treated as an asset acquisition with a full step-up in tax basis.
The Company accounted for the acquisition of Bresnan Cable in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") Topic 805.
The total purchase price was allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values.The excess of the purchase price over those fair values was recorded as goodwill.The fair value assigned to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon assumptions developed by management and other information compiled by management, including a purchase price allocation analysis.
The operating results of Bresnan Cable have been consolidated from the date of acquisition and are included in the Company's Telecommunications Services segment and the Company's Consumer Services reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.
The following table provides the allocation of the purchase price (excluding transaction costs of $8,969 which were expensed) of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value: Estimated Useful Life Accounts receivable $ 5,081 Prepaid expenses and other assets 4,033 Property and equipment 2 to 36 years 499,304 Other amortizable intangibles 3 to 18 years 1,920 Customer relationships 9 years 211,350 Franchise costs Indefinite-lived 508,380 FCC licenses Indefinite-lived 4,232 Goodwill Indefinite-lived 167,736 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (34,510 ) Deferred revenue (3,250 ) Net assets acquired $ 1,364,276 Identification and allocation of value to the identified intangible assets was based on the acquisition method of accounting. The fair value of the identified intangible assets was estimated by performing a discounted cash flow ("DCF") analysis using the "income" approach.Significant judgments in the preliminary purchase price included the selection of appropriate discount rates, estimating the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows attributable to the cable television franchises, identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions and attributing the appropriate attrition factor for customer relationships.The projected cash flow assumptions considered contractual relationships, customer attrition, eventual development of new technologies and market competition.The discount rates used in the DCF analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.This method includes a forecast of direct revenues and costs associated with the respective intangible assets and charges for economic returns on tangible and intangible assets utilized in cash flow generation. Net cash flows attributable to the identified intangible assets are discounted to their present value at a rate commensurate with the perceived risk.
I-33 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Estimates of fair value were determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions.These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rate, determination of appropriate market comparables, average annual revenue per customer, number of homes passed, operating margin, market penetration as a percentage of homes passed, and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables.
The estimates of expected useful lives take into consideration the effects of contractual relationships, customer attrition, eventual development of new technologies and market competition.
Revenues and loss from continuing operations before income taxes attributable to Bresnan Cable for the period from December14, 2010 through December31, 2010 amounted to approximately $22,135 and ($20,610), respectively, which are included in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2010.
Approximately $167,300 of goodwill recorded in connection with the Bresnan Cable acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.
The unaudited pro forma revenues, income from continuing operations, net income, income per share from continuing operations and net income per share for the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, as if the Bresnan acquisition had occurred on January1, 2009, are as follows: Cablevision CSC Holdings Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 Revenues $ 6,599,504 $ 6,316,061 $ 6,599,504 $ 6,316,061 Income from continuing operations $ 202,927 $ 100,358 $ 416,256 $ 206,009 Net income $ 356,775 $ 261,825 $ 570,104 $ 367,476 Basic income per share from continuing operations $ 0.69 $ 0.34 Basic net income per share $ 1.22 $ 0.90 Diluted income per share from continuing operations $ 0.67 $ 0.34 Diluted net income per share $ 1.18 $ 0.88 I-34 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) NOTE 5.

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the first quarter of each year or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances.As a result of the continuing deterioration of values in the newspaper industry and the greater than anticipated economic downturn and its current and anticipated impact on Newsday's advertising business, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred and the Company tested indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill for impairment as of December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (the "interim testing dates").
The Company determined the fair value of the Newsday business based on a combination of the estimated fair market values determined under the income approach and the market approach.The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow valuation methodology, which requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates based on the assessment of risks inherent in the projected future cash flows including the cash flows generated from synergies from a market participant's point of view, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, including expected cash flows beyond the Company's current long-term business planning period.The market approach measures fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies taking into consideration synergies a market participant may generate.The market approach requires significant judgments determining comparable market multiples.The estimated fair values of the Newsday business indefinite-lived intangibles, which relate primarily to the trademarks associated with its mastheads, were based on discounted future cash flows calculated utilizing the relief-from-royalty method.Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.
I-35 Table of Contents The Company's impairment analysis as of December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of $11,000, $7,800 and $2,000, respectively, related to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of certain indefinite-lived intangibles.These pre-tax impairment charges are included in depreciation and amortization (including impairments) in the Other segment.No goodwill impairment was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
In addition, the Company recorded impairment charges of $2,506, $1,803 and $1,436 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, included in depreciation and amortization.These charges relate primarily to certain other long-lived assets related to the Company's theatre operations and the Newsday business in the Other segment.

NOTE 12.
DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND COLLATERALIZED INDEBTEDNESS To manage interest rate risk, the Company has entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable interest rates.Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates.The Company does not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes and it has only entered into transactions with counterparties that are rated investment grade.The Company monitors the financial institutions that are counterparties to its interest rate swap contracts and it diversifies its swap contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution.
As of December31, 2011, CSC Holdings was party to several interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $2,600,000 that effectively fixed borrowing rates on a portion of the Company's floating rate debt.Interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $1,100,000 matured in March 2010.These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.As a result of the CSC Holdings interest rate swap transactions, the interest rate paid on approximately 81% of the Company's outstanding debt (excluding capital leases and collateralized indebtedness) is effectively fixed (56% being fixed rate obligations and 25% is effectively fixed through utilization of these interest rate swap contracts) as of December31, 2011.
I-52 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) The table below summarizes certain terms of these interest rate swap contracts as of December31, 2011: Maturity Date Notional Amount Weighted Average Fixed Rate Paid by the Company Weighted Average Effective Floating Rate Received by the Company at December31, 2011 * June 2012 $2,600,000 4.86% 0.54% ______________ * Represents the weighted average effective floating rate received by the Company under its interest rate swap contracts at December31, 2011 and does not represent the rates to be received by the Company on future payments.
The net unrealized losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the Company's swap agreements and the net realized losses as a result of net cash interest expense are reflected in loss on interest rate swap contracts, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
The Company has also entered into various transactions to limit the exposure against equity price risk on its shares of Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") common stock.The Company had monetized all of its stock holdings in Comcast Corporation through the execution of prepaid forward contracts, collateralized by an equivalent amount of the respective underlying stock.At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of Comcast stock with a value determined by reference to the applicable stock price at maturity.These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share while allowing the Company to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price.
The Company received cash proceeds upon execution of the prepaid forward contracts discussed above which has been reflected as collateralized indebtedness in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.In addition, the Company separately accounts for the equity derivative component of the prepaid forward contracts.These equity derivatives have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes.Therefore, the net fair values of the equity derivatives have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability and the net increases or decreases in the fair value of the equity derivative component of the prepaid forward contracts are included in gain (loss) on derivative contracts in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
I-53 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) All of the Company's monetization transactions are obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not part of the Restricted Group; however, in certain of the Comcast transactions, CSC Holdings provided guarantees of the subsidiaries' ongoing contract payment expense obligations and potential payments that could be due as a result of an early termination event (as defined in the agreements).The guarantee exposure approximates the net sum of the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and the equity collar and the present value of remaining interest payments.As of December31, 2011, this exposure was $1,400.
The Company monitors the financial institutions that are counterparties to its equity derivative contracts and it diversifies its equity derivative contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution.All of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings.

At December31, 2011, the Company had principal collateralized indebtedness obligations of $148,175 relating to shares of Comcast common stock that mature during the next twelve months.The Company intends to settle such obligations by either delivering shares of the applicable stock and proceeds of the equity derivative contracts or delivering cash from the proceeds of new monetization transactions.
I-54 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) In the event of an early termination of any of these contracts, the Company would be obligated to repay the guarantee (discussed above) which would be calculated based on the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar at the termination date.
Settlements of Collateralized Indebtedness The following table summarizes the settlement of the Company's collateralized indebtedness relating to Comcast Corporation shares that were settled by delivering cash equal to the collateralized loan value, net of the value of the related equity derivative contracts for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010.The cash was obtained from the proceeds of new monetization contracts covering an equivalent number of Comcast shares.The terms of the new contracts allow the Company to retain upside participation in Comcast shares up to each respective contract's upside appreciation limit with downside exposure limited to the respective hedge price.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable.Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity's pricing based upon their own market assumptions.The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:  Level I - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level II - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Level III - Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.
The FASB issued ASU No.2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic820):Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurement that outlines certain new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in ASC Topic820-10.ASU No.2010-06 became effective and was adopted by the Company on January1, 2011.
I-55 Table of Contents The following table presents for each of these hierarchy levels, the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December31, 2011 and December 31, 2010: At December 31, 2011: Level I Level II Level III Total Assets: Money market funds $ 556,853 $ - $ - $ 556,853 Restricted money market funds 27,920 - - 27,920 Investment securities 113 - - 113 Investment securities pledged as collateral 509,234 - - 509,234 Prepaid forward contracts - 18,617 - 18,617 Liabilities: Liabilities under derivative contracts: Prepaid forward contracts - 22,981 - 22,981 Interest rate swap contracts - 55,383 - 55,383 At December 31, 2010: Level I Level II Level III Total Assets: Money market funds $ 259,463 $ - $ - $ 259,463 Investment securities 101 - - 101 Investment securities pledged as collateral 471,864 - - 471,864 Liabilities: Liabilities under derivative contracts: Prepaid forward contracts - 59,300 - 59,300 Interest rate swap contracts - 167,278 - 167,278 The Company's money market funds, restricted money market funds, investment securities and investment securities pledged as collateral are classified within LevelI of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices.
The Company's derivative contracts and liabilities under derivative contracts are valued using market-based inputs to valuation models.These valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, and measures of volatility.When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit risk considerations.Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence.Since model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgment, the Company has concluded that these instruments should be classified within LevelII of the fair value hierarchy.
The Company considers the impact of credit risk when measuring the fair value of its derivative asset and/or liability positions, as applicable.
I-56 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value: Credit Facility Debt, Collateralized Indebtedness, and Senior Notes and Debentures The fair values of each of the Company's debt instruments are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for instruments of the same remaining maturities.
The carrying values and estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments, excluding those that are carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, are summarized as follows: December31, 2011 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value CSC Holdings notes receivable: Cablevision senior notes held by Newsday Holdings LLC (a) $ 753,717 $ 802,268 Debt instruments: Credit facility debt (b) $ 5,184,194 $ 5,198,987 Collateralized indebtedness 455,938 446,660 Senior notes and debentures 3,279,694 3,627,852 Notes payable 29,227 29,227 CSC Holdings total debt instruments 8,949,053 9,302,726 Cablevision senior notes and debentures 2,166,966 2,355,160 Cablevision total debt instruments $ 11,116,019 $ 11,657,886 December 31, 2010 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value CSC Holdings notes receivable: Cablevision senior notes held by Newsday Holdings LLC (a) $ 753,717 $ 795,508 Debt instruments: Credit facility debt (b) $ 5,756,510 $ 5,802,917 Collateralized indebtedness 352,606 349,853 Senior notes and debentures 3,402,505 3,781,994 CSC Holdings total debt instruments 9,511,621 9,934,764 Cablevision senior notes and debentures 2,165,688 2,328,644 Cablevision total debt instruments $ 11,677,309 $ 12,263,408 ______________ (a) These notes are eliminated at the consolidated Cablevision level.
(b) The carrying value of the Company's credit facility debt, the substantial portion of which bears interest at variable rates approximates its fair value.
Fair value estimates related to the Company's debt instruments and senior notes receivable presented above are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision.Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

INCOME TAXES Cablevision Cablevision files a consolidated federal income tax return with its 80% or more owned subsidiaries.
Income tax expense (benefit) attributable to Cablevision's continuing operations consists of the following components: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Current expense (benefit): Federal $ (1,616 ) $ (2,716 ) $ 7,639 State and other 22,295 17,134 8,798 20,679 14,418 16,437 Deferred expense (benefit): Federal 138,804 120,234 71,832 State 18,415 (24,552 ) 23,918 157,219 95,682 95,750 Tax expense relating to uncertain tax positions, including accrued interest 6,538 3,667 990 Income tax expense $ 184,436 $ 113,767 $ 113,177 The current federal income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to the carry back of a capital loss from 2009 to 2007.The current federal income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to impact of the requested change in tax accounting method with regard to certain installation costs that was approved by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") during 2010 whereby the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment to reflect current deductibility of such costs for income tax purposes.
I-58 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) The income tax expense (benefit) attributable to Cablevision's continuing operations differs from the amount derived by applying the statutory federal rate to pretax income principally due to the effect of the following items: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Federal tax expense at statutory federal rate $ 148,083 $ 112,531 $ 82,953 State income taxes, net of federal benefit 29,236 11,784 19,577 Changes in the valuation allowance 1,822 (2,428 ) (1,427 ) Change in the state rate used to determine deferred taxes, net of federal benefit (1,015 ) 5,842 (6,764 ) Tax expense relating to uncertain tax positions, including accrued interest, net of deferred tax benefits 1,699 1,202 (105 ) Impact of non-deductible officers' compensation, net 77 3,989 7,264 Other non-deductible expenses 3,742 3,246 3,340 Increase in certain state and city net operating loss carry forwards pursuant to the finalization of an examination with a taxing authority - (18,951 ) - Elimination of state carry forwards pursuant to LLC conversions - - 9,095 Research credit (1,800 ) (1,800 ) (1,200 ) Tax expense from exclusion of pretax loss of an entity that is consolidated for financial reporting purposes but not for income tax purposes 2,509 335 - Other, net 83 (1,983 ) 444 Income tax expense $ 184,436 $ 113,767 $ 113,177 I-59 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) For Cablevision, the tax effects of temporary differences which give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets or liabilities and the corresponding valuation allowance at December31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows: December 31, 2011 2010 Deferred Tax Asset (Liability) Current NOLs and tax credit carry forwards $ 69,689 $ 96,570 Compensation and benefit plans 41,330 43,074 Allowance for doubtful accounts 5,286 6,260 Other liabilities 10,868 8,626 Deferred tax asset 127,173 154,530 Valuation allowance (2,311 ) (2,217 ) Net deferred tax asset, current 124,862 152,313 Investments (39,937 ) (48,668 ) Deferred tax liability, current (39,937 ) (48,668 ) Net deferred tax asset, current 84,925 103,645 Noncurrent NOLs and tax credit carry forwards 523,548 513,319 Compensation and benefit plans 85,122 57,929 Investments - 4,565 Partnership investments 159,456 161,501 Other 11,948 8,483 Deferred tax asset 780,074 745,797 Valuation allowance (12,036 ) (11,224 ) Net deferred tax asset, noncurrent 768,038 734,573 Fixed assets and intangibles (793,332 ) (620,987 ) Investments (35,943 ) - Other assets (19,309 ) (14,299 ) Deferred tax liability, noncurrent (848,584 ) (635,286 ) Net deferred tax asset (liability), noncurrent (80,546 ) 99,287 Total net deferred tax asset $ 4,379 $ 202,932 The increase in the deferred tax liability with regard to fixed assets from December 31, 2010 to December31, 2011 is primarily attributable to the estimated impact of additional first-year bonus depreciation deductions for federal income tax purposes for certain capital expenditures.
At December31, 2011, Cablevision had consolidated federal NOLs of $1,659,345 expiring on various dates from 2021 through 2031.Cablevision has recorded a deferred tax asset related to $1,402,443 of such NOLs.A deferred tax asset has not been recorded for the remaining NOL of $256,902 as this portion relates to excess tax benefits that have not yet been realized, including 'windfall' deductions on share-based awards and amortization of certain tax deductible goodwill.The tax deduction resulting from the exercise and issuance of certain share-based awards exceeded the aggregate compensation expense for such awards by $46,362 in 2011 and by $242,525 on a cumulative basis through December31, 2011.Cablevision uses the 'with-and-without' approach to determine whether an excess tax benefit has been realized.Upon realization, such excess tax benefits will be recorded as an increase to paid-in capital with regard to share-based awards and as a decrease in goodwill with regard to certain tax deductible goodwill.
As of December31, 2011, Cablevision has $20,443 of federal alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards, which do not expire.
I-60 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Subsequent to the utilization of Cablevision's NOLs and tax credit carry forwards, payments for income taxes are expected to increase significantly.
CSC Holdings CSC Holdings and its 80% or more owned subsidiaries were included in the consolidated federal income tax returns of Cablevision for the years presented herein.CSC Holdings was converted to a limited liability company on November10, 2009.The income tax provision for CSC Holdings is determined on a stand-alone basis for all periods presented, including the period subsequent to the LLC conversion, as if CSC Holdings filed separate consolidated income tax returns.
Income tax expense (benefit) attributable to continuing operations consists of the following components: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Current expense: Federal $ (835 ) $ 6,190 $ 11,174 State and other 33,491 17,134 8,798 32,656 23,324 19,972 Deferred expense (benefit): Federal 210,415 226,188 125,182 State 42,989 (2,293 ) 38,111 253,404 223,895 163,293 Tax expense relating to uncertain tax positions, including accrued interest 6,538 3,667 990 Income tax expense $ 292,598 $ 250,886 $ 184,255 The current federal income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to the carry back of a capital loss from 2009 to 2007.The current federal tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to the estimated federal income tax liability of CSC Holdings on a stand-alone basis, partially offset by the impact of the requested change in tax accounting method with regard to certain installation costs that was approved by the IRS during 2010 whereby the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment to reflect current deductibility of such costs for income tax purposes.
In connection with the tax allocation policy between CSC Holdings and Cablevision, CSC Holdings has recorded a payable due to Cablevision and Cablevision has recorded a receivable due from CSC Holdings, both in the amount of $773, representing the estimated federal income tax liability of CSC Holdings for the year ended December31, 2011 as determined on a stand-alone basis as if CSC Holdings filed separate federal consolidated income tax returns.
I-61 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) The income tax expense (benefit) attributable to CSC Holdings' continuing operations differs from the amount derived by applying the statutory federal rate to pretax income principally due to the effect of the following items: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Federal tax expense (benefit) at statutory federal rate $ 232,987 $ 235,187 $ 144,808 State income taxes, net of federal benefit 45,237 30,263 29,777 Changes in the valuation allowance 1,822 (2,428 ) (1,427 ) Change in the state rate used to determine deferred taxes, net of federal benefit 5,800 2,925 (8,510 ) Tax expense relating to uncertain tax positions, including accrued interest, net of deferred tax benefits 1,699 1,202 (105 ) Impact of non-deductible officers' compensation, net 77 3,989 7,264 Other non-deductible expenses 3,742 3,246 3,340 Increase in certain state and city net operating loss carry forwards pursuant to the finalization of an examination with a taxing authority - (18,951 ) - Elimination of state carry forwards pursuant to LLC conversions - - 9,095 Research credit (1,800 ) (1,800 ) (1,200 ) Tax expense from exclusion of pretax loss of an entity that is consolidated for financial reporting purposes but not for income tax purposes 2,509 335 - Other, net 525 (3,082 ) 1,213 Income tax expense $ 292,598 $ 250,886 $ 184,255 I-62 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) For CSC Holdings, the tax effects of temporary differences which give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets or liabilities and the corresponding valuation allowance at December31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows: December 31, 2011 2010 Deferred Tax Asset (Liability) Current NOLs and tax credit carry forwards $ 79,318 $ 152,163 Compensation and benefit plans 41,330 43,074 Allowance for doubtful accounts 5,286 6,260 Other liabilities 10,868 8,626 Deferred tax asset 136,802 210,123 Valuation allowance (5,493 ) (5,968 ) Net deferred tax asset, current 131,309 204,155 Investments (39,937 ) (48,668 ) Deferred tax liability, current (39,937 ) (48,668 ) Net deferred tax asset, current 91,372 $ 155,487 Noncurrent Tax credit carry forwards 492 41,634 Compensation and benefit plans 85,122 57,929 Investments - 4,565 Partnership investments 159,456 161,501 Other 11,948 8,483 Deferred tax asset 257,018 274,112 Valuation allowance (8,854 ) (7,473 ) Net deferred tax asset, noncurrent 248,164 266,639 Fixed assets and intangibles (793,332 ) (620,987 ) Investments (35,943 ) - Other assets (19,309 ) (14,299 ) Deferred tax liability, noncurrent (848,584 ) (635,286 ) Net deferred tax liability, noncurrent (600,420 ) (368,647 ) Total net deferred tax liability $ (509,048 ) $ (213,160 ) The increase in the deferred tax liability with regard to fixed assets from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to the estimated impact of additional first-year bonus depreciation deductions for federal income tax purposes with regard to certain capital expenditures.
At December31, 2011, on a stand-alone basis CSC Holdings had consolidated federal NOLs of $253,868, expiring in 2024.CSC Holdings has recorded a deferred tax asset related to $84,816 of such NOLs.A deferred tax asset has not been recorded for the remaining NOL of $169,052 as this portion relates to excess tax benefits that have not yet been realized, including 'windfall' deductions on share-based awards and amortization of certain tax deductible goodwill.The tax deduction resulting from the exercise and issuance of certain share-based awards exceeded the aggregate compensation expense for such awards by $46,362 in 2011 and by $154,675 on a cumulative basis through December31, 2011.Cablevision uses the 'with-and-without' approach to determine whether an excess tax benefit has been realized.Upon realization, such excess tax benefits will be recorded as an increase to paid-in capital with regard to share-based awards and as a decrease in goodwill with regard to certain tax deductible goodwill.However, on a stand-alone basis CSC Holdings realized excess state tax benefit of $11,196 during the year ended December31, 2011.Such excess tax benefit resulted in an increase to additional paid-in capital.Subsequent to the utilization of CSC Holdings' net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, including the portion relating to remaining excess tax benefits not yet realized, obligations to Cablevision pursuant to the tax allocation policy will increase significantly.
I-63 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) As of December31, 2011, on a stand-alone basis CSC Holdings has $40,416 of alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards, which do not expire.
The Company Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Company's future deductible temporary differences and NOLs.In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.The Company's ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income and tax planning strategies to allow for the utilization of its NOLs and deductible temporary differences.If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense in the Company's consolidated statement of income.Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly.At this time, based on current facts and circumstances, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize benefit for its gross deferred tax assets, except those deferred tax assets against which a valuation allowance has been recorded which relate to certain state NOLs.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions, excluding associated deferred tax benefits and accrued interest, is as follows: Balance at December31, 2010 $ 60,098 Increases related to prior year tax positions 4,535 Decreases related to prior year tax positions (341 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 329 Settlements - Lapse of statute of limitations - Balance at December 31, 2011 $ 64,621 As of December31, 2011, if all uncertain tax positions were sustained at the amounts reported or expected to be reported in the Company's tax returns, the elimination of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits, net of the deferred tax impact, would decrease income tax expense by $58,319.
Interest expense related to uncertain tax positions is included in income tax expense, consistent with the Company's historical policy.After considering the associated deferred tax benefit, interest expense of $1,179, $1,210 and $385 has been included in income tax expense attributable to continuing operations in the consolidated statements of income for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.At December 31, 2011, accrued interest on uncertain tax positions of $306 and $3,015 was included in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet.
I-64 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of the gross liability for uncertain tax positions existing as of December31, 2011 will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months of December31, 2011.
With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and local income tax audits by taxing authorities for years prior to 2007.The most significant jurisdictions in which the Company is required to file income tax returns include the states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and the city of New York.The IRS is presently examining the Company's consolidated federal income tax returns for years 2006 through 2008.The State of New York is presently auditing income tax returns for years 2006 through 2008.
Management does not believe that the resolution of the ongoing income tax examinations described above will have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the Company.Changes in the liabilities for uncertain tax positions will be recognized in the interim period in which the positions are effectively settled or there is a change in factual circumstances.
NOTE 15.
BENEFIT PLANS Plan Descriptions Qualified and Non-qualified Defined Benefit Plans Cablevision Retirement Plans (collectively, the "Cablevision Defined Benefit Plans") The Company sponsors a non-contributory qualified defined benefit cash balance retirement plan (the "Pension Plan") for the benefit of non-union employees other than those of the theatre business, Bresnan Cable and Newsday (subsequent to May 1, 2009).Under the Pension Plan, the Company credits a certain percentage of eligible pay into an account established for each participant which is credited with a market based rate of return monthly.
The Company also maintains an unfunded non-contributory non-qualified defined benefit excess cash balance plan ("Excess Cash Balance Plan") covering certain employees of the Company who participate in the Pension Plan, as well as an additional unfunded non-contributory non-qualified defined benefit plan ("CSC Supplemental Benefit Plan")for the benefit of certain officers and employees of the Company which provides that, upon attaining normal retirement age, a participant will receive a benefit equal to a specified percentage of the participant's average compensation, as defined.All participants are 100% vested in the CSC Supplemental Benefit Plan.
In May 2011, the Pension Plan was amended whereby all benefits earned by employees of AMC Networks who participated in the Pension Plan were frozen as of the AMC Networks Distribution date.Also, all active employees of AMC Networks that participated in the Pension Plan who were unvested as of the AMC Networks Distribution became fully vested as of the AMC Networks Distribution date.
Effective January1, 2010, employees of Madison Square Garden ceased participation in the Pension Plan and Excess Cash Balance Plan and began participation in a Madison Square Garden sponsored cash balance pension plan and an excess cash balance plan (the "MSG Plans Transfer").Also effective January1, 2010, Madison Square Garden assumed the liability to pay benefits to its current and former employees who had previously participated in the Pension Plan and Excess Cash Balance Plan.

I-67 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Plan Assumptions for Defined Benefit Plans Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost (made at the beginning of the year) and benefit obligations (made at the end of the year) for the Cablevision defined benefit plans are as follows: Weighted-Average Assumptions Net Periodic Benefit Cost for the Years Ended December 31, Benefit Obligations at December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 Discount rate 5.25% 5.17% 5.58% 4.32% 5.25% Rate of increase in future compensation levels 3.50% 3.50% 4.50% 3.50% 3.50% Expected rate of return on plan assets (Pension Plan only) 5.04% 4.38% 4.00% N/A N/A In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the discount rates used by the Company in calculating the net periodic benefit cost were determined (based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the pension plans) from the Buck Consultants' Discount Rate Model (which is developed by examining the yields on selected highly rated corporate bonds), to select a rate at which the Company believed the pension benefits could be effectively settled.
In December 2010, the Pension Plan's actuary completed an experience study of the demographic assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of the Pension Plan.The assumptions reviewed included the expected rates of termination and retirement, as well as the assumed timing of benefit commencements and lump sum utilization rates.Based on this analysis, the actuary developed revised demographic assumptions, which were utilized in calculating the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2010.The use of the revised assumptions resulted in an increase in the Pension Plan's expected duration of benefit payments as compared to the previous years.Although overall discount rates decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009, the increase in the expected duration of benefit payments yielded a higher discount rate as compared to the discount rate under the Pension Plan's historical expected duration of benefit payments.
The Company's expected long-term return on plan assets is based on a periodic review and modeling of the plan's asset allocation structure over a long-term horizon.Expectations of returns for each asset class are the most important of the assumptions used in the review and modeling and are based on comprehensive reviews of historical data, forward looking economic outlook, and economic/financial market theory.The expected long-term rate of returns were selected from within the reasonable range of rates determined by (a)historical real returns, net of inflation, for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, and (b)projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants.
I-68 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Plan Assets and Investment Policy The weighted average asset allocations of the Pension Plan at December31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Plan Assets at December 31, 2011 2010 Asset Class: Fixed income securities 93 % 91 % Cash equivalents and other (a) 7 9 100 % 100 % ______________ (a) Represents investment in mutual funds that invest primarily in money market securities.
The Pension Plan's investment objectives reflect an overall low risk tolerance to stock market volatility.This strategy allows for the Pension Plan to invest in portfolios that would obtain a market rate of return throughout economic cycles, commensurate with the investment risk and cash flow needs of the Pension Plan.This requires the Pension Plan to subject a portion of its assets to increased risk to generate a greater rate of return.The investments held in the Pension Plan are readily marketable and can be sold to fund benefit payment obligations of the plan as they become payable.
Investment allocation decisions are formally made by the Company's Investment and Benefit Committee, which takes into account investment advice provided by its external investment consultant.The investment consultant takes into account expected long-term risk, return, correlation, and other prudent investment assumptions when recommending asset classes and investment managers to the Company's Investment and Benefit Committee.The investment consultant also takes into account the Pension Plan's liabilities when making investment allocation decisions.These decisions are driven by asset/liability studies conducted by the external investment consultant who combine actuarial considerations and strategic investment advice.The major categories of the Pension Plan Trust's assets are cash equivalents and bonds which are marked-to-market on a daily basis.Due to the Pension Plan Trust's significant holdings in long-term government and non-government securities, the Pension Plan Trust's assets are subjected to interest-rate risk; specifically, a rising interest rate environment.However, these assets are structured in an asset/liability framework. Consequently, an increase in interest rates causes a corresponding decrease to the overall liability of the Pension Plan thus creating a hedge against rising interest rates.Additional risks involving the asset/liability framework include earning insufficient returns to cover future liabilities and imperfect hedging of the liability.In addition, a portion of the Pension Plan Trust's bond portfolio is invested in foreign debt securities where there could be foreign currency risks associated with them, as well as in non-government securities which are subject to credit-risk of the bond issuer defaulting on interest and/or principal payments.

Benefit Payments and Contributions for Defined Benefit Plans The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid: 2012 $ 22,994 2013 27,231 2014 30,964 2015 32,788 2016 34,758 2017-2021 199,766 Of the amounts expected to be paid in 2012, the Company has recorded $1,947 as a current liability in its consolidated balance sheets at December31, 2011, since this amount represents the aggregate benefit payment obligation payable in the next twelve months that exceeds the fair value of aggregate plan assets at December31, 2011 for the Company's Excess Cash Balance Plan and CSC Supplemental Benefit Plan.
I-70 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) The Company currently expects to contribute approximately $21,600 to the Pension Plan in 2012.
Defined Contribution Benefit Plans The Company also maintains the Cablevision 401(k) Savings Plan, a contributory qualified defined contribution plan for the benefit of non-union employees of the Company.Employees can contribute a percentage of eligible annual compensation and the Company will make a matching cash contribution or discretionary contribution, as defined in the plan.In addition, the Company maintains an unfunded non-qualified excess savings plan for which the Company provides a matching contribution similar to the Cablevision 401(k) Savings Plan.The cost associated with these plans was $23,011, $23,395 and $21,377 for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
NOTE 16.
EQUITY AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS Cablevision's Equity Plans In April 2006, Cablevision's Board of Directors approved the Cablevision Systems Corporation 2006 Employee Stock Plan and the Cablevision Systems Corporation 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which was approved by Cablevision's stockholders at its annual stockholders meeting on May18, 2006.
Under the 2006 Employee Stock Plan, Cablevision is authorized to grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and other equity-based awards.Cablevision may grant awards for up to 46,000,000 shares of CNYG ClassA common stock (subject to certain adjustments).Options and stock appreciation rights under the 2006 Employee Stock Plan must be granted with an exercise price of not less than the fair market value of a share of CNYG ClassA common stock on the date of grant and must expire no later than 10years from the date of grant (or up to one additional year in the case of the death of a holder).The terms and conditions of awards granted under the 2006 Employee Stock Plan, including vesting and exercisability, are determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors and may be based upon performance criteria.
Under the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, Cablevision is authorized to grant nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units and other equity-based awards.Cablevision may grant awards for up to 1,000,000 shares of CNYG ClassA common stock (subject to certain adjustments) under this plan.Options under this plan must be granted with an exercise price of not less than the fair market value of a share of CNYG ClassA common stock on the date of grant and must expire no later than 10years from the date of grant (or up to one additional year in the case of the death of a holder).The terms and conditions of awards granted under the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, including vesting and exercisability, are determined by the compensation committee.Unless otherwise provided in an applicable award agreement, options granted under this plan will be fully vested and exercisable, and restricted stock units granted under this plan will be fully vested, upon the date of grant.Unless otherwise determined by the compensation committee, on the date of each annual meeting of Cablevision's stockholders, each non-employee director will receive a number of restricted stock units for the number of shares of common stock equal to $110,000 divided by the fair value of a share of CNYG Class A stock based on the closing price on the date of grant.In 2011 and 2010, Cablevision granted its non-employee directors an aggregate of 32,460 and 52,151 restricted stock units, respectively, which vested on the date of grant.
I-71 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Previously, Cablevision had an employee stock plan ("1996 Employee Stock Plan") under which it was authorized to grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and bonus awards and a non-employee director stock plan ("1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan") under which it was authorized to grant options and restricted stock units.The 1996 Employee Stock Plan expired in February 2006 and the 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan expired in May 2006.Outstanding options issued pursuant to these plans have expiration dates through 2015.
Options and stock appreciation rights have typically been scheduled to vest over three years in 33-1/3% annual increments and expire 10 years from the grant date.Restricted shares have typically been subject to three or four year cliff vesting.Performance based options were typically subject to approximately two year or three year cliff vesting, with exercisability subject to performance criteria.Performance based restricted stock are subject to three year cliff vesting subject to achievement of performance criteria. Performance based options typically expire 10 years from the date of grant (or up to one additional year in the case of the death of the holder).Cablevision has 98,752 fully vested stock appreciation rights outstanding (which include 57,152 held by AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden employees) at December31, 2011.Total non-employee director restricted stock units outstanding as of December31, 2011 were 235,826.There were no stock options or stock appreciation rights granted in 2011.
Since share-based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, such compensation (which includes options, restricted stock, and stock appreciation rights) for theyears ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.Forfeitures were estimated based primarily on historical experience.Share-based compensation expense (including expenses related to AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden share-based awards held by Company employees) recognized for continuing operations as selling, general and administrative expense for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to $44,536, $50,289 and $49,820 (of which $44,877, $48,434 and $47,143 related to equity classified awards), respectively.An income tax benefit of $17,782, $18,142 and $15,467 was recognized in continuing operations resulting from this share-based compensation expense for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The following table presents the share-based compensation expense (income) for continuing operations recognized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Stock options (including performance based options) $ 3,931 $ 4,877 $ 6,697 Stock appreciation rights (341 ) 1,855 2,677 Restricted shares 40,946 43,557 40,446 Share-based compensation $ 44,536 $ 50,289 $ 49,820 Cablevision uses the 'with-and-without' approach to determine the recognition and measurement ofexcess tax benefits.
Cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits are classified as cash flows from financing activities.Excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from tax deductions for options exercised and restricted shares issued in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock compensation costs for such awards.Excess tax benefits of $11,196 were recorded at CSC Holdings for the year ended December 31, 2011.No excess tax benefits for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 for Cablevision and for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 for CSC Holdings were recorded.
Cash received from option exercises for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $6,471, $21,768 and $17,663, respectively.
I-72 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Valuation Assumptions - Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights Cablevision calculates the fair value of each option award on the date of grant and for each stock appreciation right on the date of grant and at the end of each reporting period using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.Cablevision's computation of expected life was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share-based awards and vesting schedules, or by using the simplified method (the average of the vesting period and option term), if applicable.The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is based on interest yields for U.S.Treasury instruments in effect at the time of grant.For stock appreciation rights, the interest rate is based on interest yields for U.S.Treasury instruments in effect at the time of grantand at the end of each reporting period.Cablevision's computation of expected volatility is based on historical volatility of its common stock.
Treatment of Share-Based Payment Awards After the AMC Networks Distribution and MSG Distribution In connection with the AMC Networks Distribution and MSG Distribution, and as provided for in the Company's equity plans, each stock option and stock appreciation right ("SAR") outstanding at the effective date of the AMC Networks Distribution and MSG Distribution became:(i)one option and one SAR with respect to CNYG Class A Common Stock, (ii)one option and one SAR with respect to AMC Networks Class A common stock, and (iii)one option and one SAR with respect to Madison Square Garden Class A common stockThe existing exercise price of each option/SAR was allocated between the existing Cablevision option/SAR, AMC Networks option/SAR and Madison Square Garden option/SAR based on the average of the volume weighted average prices of AMC Network's, Madison Square Garden's and Cablevision's common shares for the ten trading days immediately following the AMC Networks Distribution and MSG Distribution.The underlying share amount took into account the 1:4 distribution ratio for both the AMC Networks Distribution and MSG Distribution. As a result of these adjustments, 82.63% of the pre-MSG Distribution exercise price of options/rights was allocated to the Cablevision options/rights and 17.37% was allocated to the new Madison Square Garden options/rights and approximately 73.59% of the pre-AMC Networks Distribution exercise price of options/SARs was allocated to the Cablevision options/SARs and approximately 26.41% was allocated to the new AMC Networks options/SARs.No additional compensation expense was recorded as a result of these modifications for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010.

I-76 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cablevision recognizes compensation expense for restricted shares issued to its employees using a straight-line amortization method, based on the grant date price of CNYG Class A common stock over the service period.
For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the amount of cash used by the Company to settle the aggregate intrinsic value of stock appreciation rights exercised under Cablevision's stock plans was $879, $6,443 and $1,308, respectively, determined as of the date of exercise.The aggregate intrinsic value, which was settled in cash, is calculated as the difference between (i)the exercise price of the underlying awards and (ii)the quoted price of the CNYG ClassA common stock as of the date of exercise, plus dividends, as applicable.
As of December31, 2011, there was $42,657 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to Cablevision's unvested options and restricted shares granted under Cablevision's stock plans.The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1year.
During the year ended December31, 2011, 2,616,030 Cablevision restricted shares issued to employees of the Company, AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden vested.To fulfill the employees' statutory minimum tax withholding obligations for the applicable income and other employment taxes, 1,071,017 of these shares, with an aggregate value of $35,555, were surrendered to the Company.These acquired shares have been classified as treasury stock.
Long-Term Incentive Plans In April 2006, Cablevision's Board of Directors approved the Cablevision Systems Corporation 2006 Cash Incentive Plan, which was approved by Cablevision's stockholders at its annual stockholders meeting in May 2006.
In connection with the long-term incentive awards outstanding, the Company has recorded expenses in continuing operations of $2,920, $48,410 and $44,106 for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.At December31, 2011, the Company had accrued $1,970 for performance-based awards for which the performance criteria had not yet been met as of December31, 2011 as such awards are based on achievement of certain performance criteria through December31, 2012 and 2013.The Company has accrued the amount that it currently believes will ultimately be paid based upon the performance criteria established for these performance-based awards.In 2011, the Company reversed and substantially reduced accruals related to awards with performance criteria through December31, 2012 and 2013.

Revenues, net The Company recognizes revenue in connection with television advertisements and print advertising, as well as certain telecommunication services charged by its subsidiaries to AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden.
The Company and its subsidiaries, together with AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden, may enter into agreements with third parties in which the amounts paid/received by AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden, their subsidiaries, or the Company may differ from the amounts that would have been paid/received if such arrangements were negotiated separately.Where subsidiaries of the Company have incurred a cost incremental to fair value and Madison Square Garden or AMC Networks have received a benefit incremental to fair value from these negotiations, the Company and its subsidiaries will charge Madison Square Garden or AMC Networks for the incremental amount.
Technical Expenses, net of Credits Technical expenses include costs incurred by the Company for the carriage of the MSG networks and Fuse program services, as well as for AMC, WE tv, IFC and Sundance Channel on Cablevision's cable systems.The Company also purchases certain programming signal transmission and production services from AMC Networks.
Effective January1, 2010, a new long-term affiliation agreement was entered into between Cablevision and the MSG networks, which are owned by Madison Square Garden.This new long-term affiliation agreement resulted in incremental programming costs to the Company of approximately $29,000 for the year ended December31, 2010, as compared to the amount of programming costs recognized by the Company pursuant to the Company's arrangement with Madison Square Garden in 2009.This new affiliation agreement provides for the carriage of the MSG Network and MSG Plus program services on the Company's cable television systems in the tri-state area.This agreement has a term of 10years, obligates the Company to carry the MSG networks program services on its cable television systems and provides for the payment by the Company to the MSG networks of a per subscriber license fee, which fee is increased each year during the term of the agreement.

I-81 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Many of the Company's franchise agreements and utility pole leases require the Company to remove its cable wires and other equipment upon termination of the respective agreements.The Company has concluded that the fair value of these asset retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated since the range of potential settlement dates is not determinable.
Legal Matters Cable Business Litigation Brantley, et al. v. NBC Universal, Inc. et al .: On September20, 2007, individual cable and satellite subscribers, purportedly on behalf of a nationwide class of cable and satellite subscribers, filed an antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against Cablevision and several other defendants, including other cable and satellite providers and programming content providers.The complaint, as amended, alleges that the defendants violated Section1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by agreeing to the sale and licensing of programming on a "bundled" basis and by offering programming in packaged tiers rather than on an " la carte" basis.Plaintiffs seek unspecified treble monetary damages and injunctive relief.On June12, 2009, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the third amended complaint.On October15, 2009, the District Court granted the defendants' motions and dismissed the third amended complaint with prejudice for failure to plead foreclosure of any non-defendant programmers, which the Court held to be a necessary element of the alleged antitrust injury.On April19, 2010, Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.On June3, 2011, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the action.On July7, 2011, Plaintiffs filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc with the Ninth Circuit.In an order issued on October 31, 2011, following the death of a member of the original panel, the Ninth Circuit withdrew its decision, denied the petitions for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc as moot, and directed that the three-judge panel be reconstituted with a new third member.The Company intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously, but is unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit with certainty or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss.
Marchese, et al. v. Cablevision Systems Corporation and CSC Holdings, LLC: The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey by several present and former Cablevision subscribers, purportedly on behalf of a class of iO video subscribers in New Jersey, Connecticut and New York.After three versions of the complaint were dismissed without prejudice by the District Court, Plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint on August22, 2011, alleging that the Company violated Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by allegedly tying the sale of interactive services offered as part of iO television packages to the rental and use of set-top boxes distributed by Cablevision, and violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by allegedly seeking to monopolize the distribution of Cablevision-compatible set-top boxes.Plaintiffs seek unspecified treble monetary damages, attorney's fees,as well as injunctive and declaratory relief.On September 23, 2011, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. On January10, 2012, the District Court issued a decision dismissing with prejudice the Section2 monopolization claim, but allowing the Section1 tying claim and related state common law claims to proceed.Cablevision's answer to the third amended complaint was filed on February13, 2012 .
The Company believes that these claims are without merit and intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously, but is unable to predict the outcome of the lawsuit with certainty or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss.
I-82 Table of Contents COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) In re Cablevision Consumer Litigation: Following expiration of the affiliation agreements for carriage of certain Fox broadcast stations and cable networks on October16, 2010, News Corporation terminated delivery of the programming feeds to the Company, and as a result, those stations and networks were unavailable on the Company's cable television systems.On October30, 2010, the Company and Fox reached an agreement on new affiliation agreements for these stations and networks, and carriage was restored.Several class action lawsuits were subsequently filed on behalf of the Company's customers seeking recovery for the lack of Fox programming.Those lawsuits were consolidated in an action before the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, and a consolidated complaint was filed in that court on February22, 2011.The plaintiffs have asserted claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and consumer fraud, and seek unspecified compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorneys' fees.The Company has filed a motion to dismiss this action.The Court's decision is pending.The Company believes that these claims are without merit and intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously, but is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits with certainty or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss.
Livingston v. Cablevision Systems Corporation, et al.: On January26, 2012, a securities lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Company and certain current and former officers, by a Cablevision shareholder, purportedly on behalf of a class of individuals who purchased Cablevision common stock between February16, 2011 and October28, 2011.The complaint alleges that the Company and the individual defendants violated Section10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act by allegedly issuing materially false and misleading statements regarding (i)the Company's customer retention and advertising costs, and (ii)the Company's loss of video customers, especially in the New York area.The complaint also alleges that the individual defendants violated Section20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act for the same alleged conduct.Plaintiff seeks unspecified monetary damages, attorneys' fees, and equitable relief.The Company believes that these claims are without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously, but is unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit with certainty or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss.
Patent Litigation Cablevision is named as a defendant in certain lawsuits claiming infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of the Company's businesses.In certain of these cases other industry participants are also defendants.In certain of these cases the Company expects that any potential liability would be the responsibility of the Company's equipment vendors pursuant to applicable contractual indemnification provisions.The Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously, but is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits with certainty or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss.
DISH Network Contract Dispute In 2005, subsidiaries of the Company (now subsidiaries of AMC Networks) entered into agreements with EchoStar Communications Corporation and its affiliates by which EchoStar Media Holdings Corporation acquired a 20% interest in VOOM HD Holdings LLC ("VOOM HD") and EchoStar Satellite LLC (the predecessor to DISH Network, LLC ("DISH Network")) agreed to distribute VOOM on DISH Network for a 15-year term.The affiliation agreement with DISH Network for such distribution provides that if VOOM HD fails to spend $100,000 per year (subject to reduction to the extent that the number of offered channels is reduced to fewer than 21), up to a maximum of $500,000 in the aggregate, on VOOM, DISH Network may seek to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances.On January30, 2008, DISH Network purported to terminate the affiliation agreement, effective February1, 2008, based on its assertion that VOOM HD had failed to comply with this spending provision in 2006.On January31, 2008, VOOM HD sought and obtained a temporary restraining order from the New York Supreme Court for New York County prohibiting DISH Network from terminating the affiliation agreement.In conjunction with its request for a temporary restraining order, VOOM HD also requested a preliminary injunction and filed a lawsuit against DISH Network asserting that DISH Network did not have the right to terminate the affiliation agreement.In a decision filed on May5, 2008, the court denied VOOM HD's motion for a preliminary injunction.On or about May13, 2008, DISH Network ceased distribution of VOOM on its DISH Network.On May27, 2008, VOOM HD amended its complaint to seek damages for DISH Network's improper termination of the affiliation agreement.On June24, 2008, DISH Network answered VOOM HD's amended complaint and asserted counterclaims alleging breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing with respect to the affiliation agreement.On July14, 2008, VOOM HD replied to DISH Network's counterclaims.The Company believes that the counterclaims asserted by DISH Network are without merit.VOOM HD and DISH Network each filed cross-motions for summary judgment.In November 2010, the court denied both parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, but granted VOOM HD's motion for sanctions based on DISH Network's spoliation of evidence as well as its motion to exclude DISH Network's principal damages expert.DISH Network appealed these latter two rulings.On January 31, 2012, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court issued a decision affirming (i) the trial court's finding of spoliation and imposition of the sanction of an adverse inference at trial; and (ii) the trial court's decision to exclude DISH Network's damages expert.On February 6, 2012, DISH Network filed a motion seeking leave from the Appellate Division to appeal the order.VOOM has opposed the motion.Further proceedings in the trial court remain stayed pending the appellate court's ruling on the motion.
I-83 Table of Contents In connection with the AMC Networks Distribution, CSC Holdings and AMC Networks and its subsidiary, Rainbow Programming Holdings, LLC (collectively, the "AMC Parties") have entered into an agreement (the "VOOM Litigation Agreement") which provides that from and after the AMC Networks Distribution date, CSC Holdings retains full control over the pending litigation with DISH Network.Any decision with respect to settlement will be made jointly by CSC Holdings and the AMC Parties.CSC Holdings and the AMC Parties will share equally in the proceeds (including in the value of any non-cash consideration) of any settlement or final judgment in the pending litigation with DISH Network that are received by subsidiaries of AMC Networks from VOOM HD.CSC Holdings and the AMC Parties will also bear equally the legal fees and expenses once such costs reach an agreed-upon threshold.
Tax Disputes The Company has been under examination by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance ("NYS") for sales tax with regard to the Optimum Voice business for the period June1, 2006 through November30, 2007.In March 2009, NYS concluded the audit and issued a proposed assessment ("Notice") totaling approximately $16,000, including tax, interest and penalties.The foregoing amount does not include any amounts which could be assessed for periods subsequent to November 2007, including additional interest and penalties.The Notice is not a final assessment at this time, because the Company requested, on a timely basis, further review by the Division of Tax Appeals by filing a petition for an Administrative Law Judge hearing.The administrative hearing has been adjourned to allow the Company and NYS an opportunity to discuss possible resolutions of this matter.The principal audit issue is the amount of Optimum Voice revenue that should be subject to tax.The Company has collected and remitted, and continues to collect and remit, sales tax on more than 75% of its VoIP revenue, based in part on the provision of New York state law that specifically excludes interstate and international telephone service from tax and the Company's reasonable calculation of subscriber interstate and international usage.NYS has asserted that all Optimum Voice revenue, less embedded sales tax included in the subscriber fee, bad debts and other customer adjustments, should be subject to sales tax.The Company believes that it has substantial defenses to such claim and will continue to vigorously contest the Notice.No provision has been made for such claim in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
I-84 Table of Contents The Montana Department of Revenue ("MT DOR") generally assesses property taxes on cable companies at 3% and on telephone companies at 6%.Historically, Bresnan Cable's cable and telephone businesses have been taxed separately by the MT DOR.In 2010, MT DOR assessed Bresnan Cable as a single telephone business and retroactively assessed it as such for 2007 through 2009.Bresnan Cable filed a declaratory judgment action against the MT DOR in Montana State Court challenging its property tax classifications for 2007 through 2010.Under Montana law, a taxpayer must first pay a current assessment of disputed property tax in order to challenge such assessment.In accordance with that law, Bresnan Cable has paid substantially all of its 2010 property tax assessment under protest, which the Company expensed when the payments were made, and is seeking a refund of the protested amount.No provision for additional tax, which amount could be up to approximately $15,000, including interest, as a single telephone business for 2007 through 2009 has been made.On September26, 2011 , the Court grantedBresnan Cable's summary judgment motion seeking to vacate the MT DOR's retroactive tax assessments for the years 2007, 2008, and 2009.The MT DOR cannot appeal this ruling until there is a final judgment in the case.The MT DOR's assessment for 2010 was the subject of a trial which took place the week of October24, 2011, in Billings, Montana.The Court's decision is pending.In the fourth quarter of 2011, Bresnan Cable paid the first half of the 2011 protest assessment (which totals approximately $11,000 for full year 2011), which is included in technical and operating expense.Bresnan Cable expects to pay and expense the second half of the 2011 protest assessment ($5,500) in the second quarter of 2012.
The Company believes it has substantial grounds for challenging the legal validity of MT DOR's assessments and intends to vigorously assert such challenges.
Other Legal Matters On April15, 2011, ThomasC. Dolan, a director and Executive Vice President, Strategy and Development, in the Office of the Chairman at Cablevision, filed a lawsuit against Cablevision and Rainbow Media Holdings in New York Supreme Court.The lawsuit raises compensation-related claims (seeking approximately $11,000) related to events in 2005.The matter is being handled under the direction of an independent committee of the Board of Directors of Cablevision.Based on the Company's assessment of this possible loss contingency, no provision has been made for this matter in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
In addition to the matters discussed above, the Company is party to various lawsuits, some involving claims for substantial damages.Although the outcome of these other matters cannot be predicted with certainty and the impact of the final resolution of these other matters on the Company's results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known, management does not believe that the resolution of these other lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company or the ability of the Company to meet its financial obligations as they become due.
