Explanatory       Note As       previously announced and disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K dated May       30,       2007, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC or the Company) has restated its       consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2006, and the related consolidated       statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for fiscal years ended       March 31, 2006 and April 1, 2005 in this Form 10-K as discussed in Note 2,       Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements in the Notes to Consolidated       Financial Statements.These restatements relate to the 1) completion       of the Companys investigation of its stock option granting practices, 2) the       correction of errors relating to the accounting for income taxes, and 3)       recognition of revenue for the sale of licenses for a software       product.This Form 10-K also reflects the restatement of Selected       Consolidated Financial Data in Item 6 for the fiscal years ended March 31,       2006, April 1, 2005, April 2, 2004 and March 28, 2003.In addition,       the quarterly financial data in Item 8 has been restated.
The       Company has not amended and does not plan to amend previously filed Annual       Reports on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for any period affected       by this restatement.
Revenue       Recognition The       Company determined that it did not correctly apply the provisions of Statement       of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition with respect to the sale of       licenses for a software product. As a result, the Company overstated       revenue and unbilled receivables and understated deferred revenue related to       this product in fiscal years prior to 2005.In fiscal years 2006 and       2005 this error resulted in an understatement of revenue.The Company       has restated revenue for fiscal 2006 and 2005 and as a result revenue increased       $23.4 and $21.4 for these years, respectively.The cumulative effect       of this error on earnings retained for use in business was a decrease of $51.1       at April 3, 2004.
Income       Taxes The       Company identified errors related to income taxes in prior periods. The       most significant of these errors related to income tax accounting for       amortization of tax bases of assets contributed to a consolidated       affiliate.The impact of the correction of this error was an increase in       income tax expense of $53.7 and $11.8 for fiscal 2006 and 2005.The       cumulative effect of the correction of this error on earnings retained for       use       in business was a decrease of $91.4 at April 3, 2004.
In       addition, the Company identified errors in the accounting for U.S. income tax       liabilities related to foreign operations.The impact of the       correction of this error was an increase in income tax expense of $6.6 and       $5.4       for fiscal 2006 and 2005.The cumulative effect of this error on       earnings retained for use in business was a decrease $15.2 at April 3,       2004.
The       Company also identified individually immaterial income tax accounting errors       that have been corrected.These errors related principally to state       income taxes, provision for a gain, the valuation of state net operating losses       and deferred tax liabilities related to state taxes.The combined       impact of these errors on income tax expense was an increase of $28.4 and $1.4       for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively.The cumulative effect of the       correction of these errors on earnings retained for use in business was a       decrease of $3.6 at April 3, 2004.
Additionally,       the Company identified certain errors in the preparation ofU.S. federal       tax returns.These included an error which understated the deduction       of certain general and administrative costs in its U.S. federal income tax       returns for fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2005 and resulted in the overstatement       of       income tax expense by $7.4 for fiscal 2005 and an understatement of income       tax       expense by $2.1 for fiscal 2006.The cumulative effect of the       correction of these errors on earnings retained for use in business was an       increase of $17.3 at April 3, 2004.
As       a       result of the errors noted above the Company incurred interest and       penalties.For fiscal 2006 and 2005 the Company has recorded       adjustments related to additional interest expense of $16.7 and $2.6,       respectively, for the income tax errors.The cumulative effect on       earnings retained for use in business was a decrease of $4.8 at April 3,       2004.The Company also recorded penalties related to the income tax       errors of $4.0 and $44.3 for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively.The       cumulative effect of the penalties for periods prior to fiscal 2005 on earnings       retained for use in business was a decrease of $7.4 at April 3,       2004.
The       total       effect of all the income tax adjustments noted above was to increase income       tax       expense $90.8 ($84.2 net of impact of interest expense) and $11.2 ($10.2 net       of       the impact of interest expense) for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005.The       cumulative effect of these errors on earnings retained for use in business       was a       decrease of $ 105.1 at April 3, 2004.
Stock       Options As       announced in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 28, 2007, the       Company has completed its internal investigation of its stock option grant       practices.As previously announced, in response to investigations of       CSC's option grant practices by the Securities and Exchange Commission and       the       United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, the       Company's Board of Directors on July 29, 2006, established a special committee,       comprised of the two most recently elected independent directors (the Special       Committee), to manage and supervise the internal investigation, and to report       the results of its investigation to the independent members of the Board of       Directors.Upon receipt of the results of the investigation, the       independent directors made conclusions required to address the issues raised       by       the investigation.
Together       with its independent counsel and forensic accountants, the Special Committee       conducted an extensive review of stock option grants made by the Company between       March1,1996, and July 31, 2006 (the Relevant Period), which covered       13,564 grants made on 520 dates.The Special Committee cooperated       with the SEC and the U.S. Attorney throughout this process.
The       Company's independent directors concluded that the evidence obtained by the       Special Committee's investigation, as well as by their own interviews of certain       current and former employees, did not establish any intentional wrongdoing       by       current or former employees or directors, and the independent directors continue       to have confidence in the integrity of management.
Based       on       the report of the Special Committee, the independent directors determined that       9,234 stock option grants should be modified, principally due to delays in       authorization and approval and the absence of definitive documentation,       including:  540                 stock option grants made on five dates between May 9, 1996, and                 June13,2002, which should have been accounted for as                 repricings of prior stock option grants, 527 of which require variable                 accounting until April 1, 2006, when the Company adopted Statement                 of                 Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based                 Payment;  3,906                 other stock option grants made on 108 dates between April 9, 1996,                 and                 April 3, 2006, for which the measurement date should be changed to                 a later                 date on which the closing stock price was higher, requiring additional                 compensation expense; and  4,788                 other stock option grants made on 71 dates between April 1, 1996,                 and July                 10, 2006, for which the measurement date should be changed to a later                 date                 on which the closing stock price was lower, requiring no additional                 compensation expense.
The       incremental cumulative non-cash compensation expense, before taxes, from       March1,1996, through June 30, 2006, related to stock options was       approximately $70 million, including approximately $30 million attributable       to       the repricings requiring variable accounting.This $70million       (approximately $60 million after taxes) has been allocated among the last 11       fiscal years and first three quarters of fiscal 2007 as follows: Pre-Tax                 Expense Fiscal                 Year Ended (in                 millions) March                 29, 1996 $ 0.0 March                 28, 1997 $ 0.4 April                 3, 1998 $ 1.8 April                 2, 1999 $ 3.2 March                 31, 2000 $ 8.7 March                 30, 2001 $ 2.8 March                 29, 2002 $ 16.8 March                 28, 2003 $ (6.5 ) April                 2, 2004 $ 14.1 April                 1, 2005 $ 8.5 March                 31, 2006 $ 20.6 Fiscal                 Quarter Ended June                 30, 2006 $ (0.2 ) The       Company also determined that the tax benefits associated with the exercise       of       certain stock options in foreign jurisdictions had been incorrectly credited       against the foreign tax provision, rather than additional paid-in       capital.The Company further determined that it had applied the       effective rate, rather than the U.S. statutory rate, in recognizing the tax       benefits associated with the exercise of stock options in the       U.S.Correction of these two tax errors resulted in an incremental       cumulative tax provision of approximately $14 million, which is included in       the       previously stated $60 million incremental cumulative after-tax compensation       expense through June 30, 2006.
Unless       otherwise indicated, all references hereafter in this explanatory note to years       are to calendar years.
Background During       the Relevant Period, CSC granted stock options to two categories of       employees:  the                 Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, each of their respective                 direct reports and each other employee who is an "officer"                 forpurposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934                 (collectively, Senior Executives);                 and  all                 other employees (collectively, Other                 Employees).
Option       grants to Senior Executives were approved by the Compensation Committee or       the       Board of Directors.Approvals for option grants to Other Employees       were delegated to the Chief Executive Officer or, after July 1999, in the case       of option grants of 5,000 shares or less, to the Corporate Vice President,       Human       Resources.The Company did not grant stock options to its independent       directors.
Option       grants during the Relevant Period can be grouped into three general       categories:  "Annual                 Cycle Options," which were granted as part of the annual compensation                 review process each year;  "Discounted                 Options," which, on and prior to May 12, 2004, were granted on the                 Annual                 Cycle Option grant date in lieu of a cash bonus, and which typically                 had                 an exercise price per share equal to 25% of the closing market price                 of                 the Company's common stock on the grant date;                 and  "Other                 Options," which primarily include options granted to new hires (including                 to employees acquired through acquisitions and outsourcings) and                 for                 promotions and special recognition.
Of       the       13,564 option grants made by the Company during the Relevant Period, (i) 9,134       were for Annual Cycle Options, (ii) 262 were for Discounted Options and (iii)       4,168 were for Other Options.The option grants in each category were       reviewed to determine the first date upon which the identity of the optionee,       the number of shares subject to the option grant and the option exercise price       were determined with finality (the measurement date).The following       describes the option grants for which the independent directors determined       that       the measurement date should be a date other than the grant date.
Annual       Cycle Options Annual       Cycle Options Granted to Senior Executives.
The       independent directors concluded that there was evidence that the Annual Cycle       Options granted to Senior Executives in 1996, 1999 and 2002 may each have had       two measurement dates: (i) the first occurring on the date of an initial action       to select the optionees, the number of option shares and the grant date closing       stock price to be used for the exercise price, and (ii) the second occurring       on       the date of a subsequent action, within 10 days, to select a later grant date       closing stock price to be used for the exercise price.Therefore, the       Company determined that the aggregate 54 Annual Cycle Option grants to Senior       Executives on May9,1996, May10,1999 and       June13,2002, should be accounted for as a repricing of options for       which a measurement date had previously been established on       May6,1996, May 3, 1999, and June 3, 2002,       respectively.Generally accepted accounting principles in effect at       the time require a change from fixed to variable accounting for the 1999 and       2002 repricings, but not for the 1996 repricing.The incremental       cumulative non-cash compensation expense before taxes from       March1,1996, through June 30, 2006, related to accounting for these       Annual Cycle Option grants to Senior Executives as repricings was approximately       $10 million.
Annual       Cycle Options Granted to Other Employees.
In       each       of the years from 1996 through 2005, there were changes, after the grant date,       in the list of Annual Cycle Options to be granted to Other       Employees.Therefore, the measurement date for all of the 7,562       Annual Cycle Options (excluding the 260 French grants discussed below) granted       to Other Employees in those years was changed to be the first date upon which       the list was determined with finality.Of these grants, 3,891 had a       lower closing stock price on the new measurement dates than on the related       grant       dates, which did not result in any additional compensation       expense.The remaining 3,671 grants did, however, except as set forth       below, result in additional compensation expense amortized over the vesting       period.
The       new       measurement date for the 2001 Annual Cycle Options granted to Other Employees       resulted in a repricing requiring variable accounting.On October 29,       2001, the Company commenced an exchange offer (the 2001 Exchange Offer) pursuant       to which employees could elect to cancel unexercised options with an exercise       price per share of $70 or more in exchange for new options.The 2001       Exchange Offer was specifically designed so that no employee eligible to       participate was granted any options during the period beginning six months       before the commencement of the 2001 Exchange Offer and ending six months after       the option cancellation date.Although the grant date of the Annual       Cycle Options granted to Other Employees in 2001 precedes the 2001 Exchange       Offer commencement date by more than six months, the new measurement date of       these Annual Cycle Options does not.Consequently, certain of these       options were treated as a repricing of options held by the same optionee which       were cancelled in the 2001 Exchange Offer.The remaining 2001 Annual       Cycle Options which were not treated as a repricing also resulted in additional       compensation expense, since the new measurement date had a higher closing stock       price than the grant date.The incremental cumulative non-cash       compensation expense before taxes through June 30, 2006, related to changing       the       measurement date of the 2001 Annual Cycle Options granted to Other Employees,       and accounting for such options as a repricing was approximately $21 million,       including approximately $19million attributable to variable       accounting.
By       2006,       the Company had revised the annual grant process, and the measurement date       of       the Annual Cycle Options granted to Other Employees on May22,2006,       is the same as the grant date.
The       foregoing description excludes all Annual Cycle Options granted to Other       Employees subject to French taxes (French Options).The Company has a       French sub-plan pursuant to which it grants French Options addressing French       tax       consequences.One of the requirements for these options is that they       not be granted during a "closed period," as defined under French tax       law.Until recently, the Company understood that the closed period       included, among other periods, the 10-trading day period before and after the       Company made a material announcement.Since the Company did not       determine the grant date of French Options until it had confirmed that no       material announcement was made during the following 10 trading days, the       measurement date for all of the 260 French Option grants made during the       Relevant Period has been changed.The Company currently believes that       the closed period does not include the 10-day period after a material       announcement (other than an earnings release or the filing of a Form 10-K or       Form10-Q).
The       incremental cumulative non-cash compensation expense before taxes from       March1,1996, through June 30, 2006, related to Annual Cycle Option       grants to Other Employees, including the $21 million relating to the 2001 Annual       Cycle Options discussed above, constitutes approximately $47million of the       total $70 million incremental cumulative non-cash compensation expense before       taxes.
Discounted       Options and Restricted Stock The       Company has identified 105 Discounted Options granted on four dates between       May3,2000, and May 12, 2004, in which the identity of the optionee       or the number of shares underlying the option was not determined with finality       until after the grant date.The incremental cumulative non-cash       compensation expense before taxes from May3,2000, through December       29, 2006, related to changing the measurement dates for these Discounted Options       grants was approximately $1million.
In       2005       and 2006, the Company granted restricted stock and restricted stock units,       respectively, in lieu of a cash bonus.Sixteen of the restricted       stock awards in 2005 were not determined with finality until after the grant       date, and the Company recorded an incremental cumulative non-cash compensation       expense before taxes from March 1, 1996, through December 29, 2006, related       to       accounting for the change in the measurement dates for these restricted stock       awards of less than $50,000.This amount has been included in the       aggregate incremental compensation expense amounts related to stock       options.
The       Company has also determined it had incorrectly reversed accruals for certain       management bonuses which had been exchanged for discounted options and       awards.The previously stated allocation of the $68 million       incremental cumulative non-cash compensation expense before taxes from March       1,1996, through December 29, 2006, related to stock options includes the       resulting increase or decrease in compensation expense for each period       affected.The cumulative impact of the bonus accrual adjustments       through June 30, 2006, was approximately $4 million.
By       2006,       the Company had revised the process for granting and accounting for equity       in       lieu of a cash bonus, and the measurement date of the restricted stock units       awarded on May22,2006, in lieu of a cash bonus is the same as the       grant date.
Other       Options During       the Relevant Period, the Company issued 4,168 Other Option grants to new hires       and for promotions, special recognition and other reasons.Of these,       the Company identified 931 which were granted to new hires who joined the       Company through an acquisition, or through an outsourcing by their former       employer, in which the measurement date should be a date other than the grant       date.Although the acquisition or outsourcing agreement generally set       forth the aggregate number of option shares to be granted to the new employees,       the specific allocation among employees was often not finalized until after       the       grant date.
The       Company has also identified 320 additional Other Option grants in which the       measurement date should be a date other than the grant date, and two Other       Option grants which should have been accounted for as repricings requiring       variable accounting.These Other Option grants were primarily made to       new hires or for promotions or special recognition.
By       2006,       the Company had revised the processes for granting Other Options, and the       measurement date of all Other Options granted after April 3, 2006, other than       those granted to French employees, is the same as the grant date.The       incremental cumulative non-cash compensation expense before taxes from       March1,1996, through June 30, 2006, related to Other Option grants       was approximately $8 million.
Changes       in Option Grant Procedure Other       than options granted to French employees, the Company has not identified any       stock option grants made after April 3, 2006, that were accounted for       incorrectly.In order to provide greater predictability and       transparency in the Company's equity granting process, however, the Board of       Directors adopted an Equity Grant Policy on February 23, 2007.The       Policy Statement provides that:  all                 terms of each equity grant must be approved on or prior to the grant                 date;  all                 stock options must have an exercise price equal to or greater than                 the                 closing market price on the grant                 date;  there                 will be a fixed, monthly grant date for all equity grants other than                 those                 issued to new hires who become CSC employees through a merger, acquisition                 or outsourcing;  all                 recipients of equity grants must be notified of such grants as soon                 as                 possible after approval, and the Company must use reasonable efforts                 to                 notify such recipients on or prior to the grant                 date;  there                 is an approval matrix for all equity                 grants;  the                 Compensation Committee must approve an annual equity grant budget                 that                 cannot be exceeded without its prior approval;                 and  the                 Company's management must make a report to the Compensation Committee,                 within two weeks after the end of each quarter, of all equity grants                 issued during the quarter.
The       Company has restated previously filed financial statements in this Form       10-K.Adjustments to net income amounted to $15.2 million and $7.3       million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and April       1,       2005.
The       incremental impact from recognizing stock-based compensation expense resulting       from the investigation of past stock option grants is as follows (dollars in       millions): Fiscal                 Year Pre-Tax Expense After                 Tax Expense 1997 $ .4 $ .3 1998 1.8 1.4 1999 3.2 1.6 2000 8.7 11.6 2001 2.8 6.0 2002 16.8 11.8 2003 (6.5 ) (4.0 ) 2004 14.1 8.9 Total                 1997  2004 impact 41.3 37.6 2005 8.5 7.3 2006 20.6 15.2 Total $ 70.4 $ 60.1 Additionally,       the Company has restated the pro forma expense under Statement of Financial       Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated       Financial Statements of this Form 10-K to reflect the impact of these       adjustments for the years ended March 31, 2006 and April 1, 2005.

Exhibits 127 i PART       I Item       1. Business INTRODUCTION       AND HISTORY General Computer       Sciences Corporation (CSC or the Company) is one of the world leaders in the       information technology (I/T) and professional services industry. Since it was       founded in 1959, the Company has helped clients use I/T more efficiently in       order to improve their operations and profitability, achieve business results       and focus on core competencies.
CSC       offers a broad array of services to clients in the Global Commercial and       government markets and specializes in the application of complex I/T to achieve       its customers strategic objectives. Its service offerings include information       technology and business process outsourcing, and I/T and professional       services.
Outsourcing       involves operating all or a portion of a customers technology infrastructure,       including systems analysis, applications development, network operations,       desktop computing and data center management. CSC also provides business process       outsourcing, managing key functions for clients, such as procurement and supply       chain, call centers and customer relationship management, credit services,       claims processing and logistics.
I/T       and       professional services include systems integration, consulting and other       professional services. Systems integration encompasses designing, developing,       implementing and integrating complete information systems. Consulting and       professional services includes advising clients on the strategic acquisition       and       utilization of I/T and on business strategy, security, modeling, simulation,       engineering, operations, change management and business process       reengineering.
The       Company also licenses sophisticated software systems for the financial services       markets and provides a broad array of end-to-end e-business solutions that       meet       the needs of large commercial and government clients. The Company focuses on       delivering results by combining business innovation skills with seasoned       delivery expertise to provide flexible and scalable solutions. To do so, CSC       draws on its vast experience in designing, building and maintaining large,       complex, mission-critical systems and applies this knowledge to todays business       challenges.
CSC       does       not have exclusive agreements with hardware or software providers and believes       this vendor neutrality enables it to better identify and manage solutions       specifically tailored to each clients needs.
Major       Markets CSC       provides its services to clients in Global Commercial industries and to the       U.S.       federal and foreign government. Segment and geographic information is included       in Note 16 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended       March 30, 2007.
In       the       Global Commercial market sector, CSCs service offerings are delivered to       clients in a wide array of industries including aerospace/defense, automotive,       chemical and resources, consumer goods, financial services, healthcare,       manufacturing, retail/distribution, telecommunications, and technology. The       Companys Global Commercial market sector also includes U.S. local and foreign       government clients.
The       Company has provided I/T services to the U.S. federal government since 1961,       is       a leading federal contractor and is one of its top I/T service providers. CSC       serves a broad federal customer base, including most civil departments and       branches of the military, as well as the Department of Homeland Security. The       Company provides a broad spectrum of services to the U.S. federal government,       ranging from traditional systems integration and outsourcing to complex project       management and technical services. Key offerings include enterprise       modernization, telecommunications and networking, managed services, base and       range operations, and training and simulation.
Geographically,       CSC has major operations throughout North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific       region, including India.
1 During       the last three fiscal years, the Companys revenue mix by major markets was as       follows: 2007 2006 2005 U.S.                 Commercial 26 % 28 % 27 % Europe 28 28 31 Other                 International 10 9 9 Global                 Commercial 64 65 67 U.S.                 Federal Government 36 35 33 Total                 Revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % Fiscal       2007 Overview During       fiscal 2007, CSC announced awards valued at approximately $16.9 billion,       including $9.2 billion of Global Commercial awards and $7.7 billion with the       U.S. federal government.These multi-year awards represent the       estimated value of the Companys portion at contract signing. They cannot be       considered firm orders, however, due to their variable attributes, including       demand-driven usage, modifications in scope of work due to changing customer       requirements, the annual funding constraints and indefinite delivery/indefinite       quantity characteristics of major portions of the Companys U.S. federal       activities.
During       April 2006, the Company implemented a restructuring program which is expected       to       positively impact future cash flow and earnings, enhancing       shareholdervalue.The program is designed to streamline CSCs       global operations and increase the use of lower cost resources, and involves       workforce reductions during fiscal 2007 and 2008 to address excess capacity       in       certain geographies.Restructuring charges consist predominantly of       severance and related employee payments resulting from       termination.As a result, during fiscal 2007, the company incurred       pre-tax restructuring charges of $333.4 million.
During       fiscal 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Datatrac Information       Services, Inc., a privately held U.S government services and solutions provider       headquartered in Richardson, Texas for an initial purchase price of $123.8       million.The acquisition expands the Companys I/T Solutions services       within the North American Public Sector, and strengthens CSCs ability to       compete for work within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other       government agencies.For further discussion, please see Note 4 to the       notes to consolidated financial statements.
Global       Commercial Market Highlights Within       the Global Commercial market, there were several significant awards to CSC       during fiscal 2007.Many of the Companys awards were extensions       and/or expansions of existing relationships, a clear indication of customer       satisfaction.
CSCs       largest commercial award during fiscal 2007 was the 9 year, $3.7 billion       contract with the United Kingdoms National Health Service.Under       this agreement CSC assumes the role of primary contractor from Accenture Ltd.       for two additional regions for the implementation of a record keeping system       for       the National Health Service.
CSC       signed a $330 million, 7 year agreement with TDC, the largest telecommunications       company in Denmark.Under the seven year contract, CSC will provide       the full scope of I/T infrastructure services including desktop, helpdesk,       data       center and local area networking services.

2 CSC       signed a $275 million, 7 year contract with UKvisas, a joint UK Home       Office and Foreign and Commonwealth Office directorate which operates as the       overseas arm of the United Kingdoms integrated border       management.CSC will establish Visa Application Centers in three       regions covering 15 countries in the Europe, Americas and North African       regions.
CSC       entered into a $180 million, 7 year I/T services agreement with Newmont Mining       Corporation, one of the worlds largest gold mining companies.Under       the agreement, CSC will manage operations for all of Newmonts global shared       services operations and regional gold mining facilities, including locations       in       Denver, Nevada, Ghana, Peru and Australia.CSC will also be       responsible for Newmonts enterprise-wide infrastructure, which includes help       desk, desktop, network, and telecommunications, and security services, as well       as server support and applications maintenance.
North       American Public Sector Highlights The       North       American Public Sector (formerly the U.S. Federal Sector) had several       significant awards during fiscal 2007 from the U.S. federal       government.
The       Companys largest U.S. federal government award during the fiscal year was the       $2.0 billion, 3 to 6 year contract with the U.S. Army.The company is       one of 11 firms that have been awarded an Information Technology Enterprise       Solutions-2 Services contract by the U.S. Army Contracting Agency on behalf       of       the Armys Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information       Systems.Under the agreement, CSC will provide a comprehensive range       of I/T services to support the Armys enterprise infrastructure       worldwide.
CSC       signed an $800 million, 4 year contract with the U.S Agency for International       Development.CSC is one of 5 firms that have been awarded a Principal       Resource for Information Management Enterprise-wide blanket purchase agreement       by U.S. Agency for International Development.CSC will provide a       comprehensive range of I/T support services in support of USAIDs mission to       provide economic development and humanitarian assistance around the       world.
CSC       entered into a $378 million, 6.5 year agreement with the U.S. Air       Force.Under the agreement CSC will provide technical and business       transformation services for the U.S. Air Force Expeditionary Combat Support       System.The Company will also be the prime systems integrator and       provide logistics business process redesign and commercial off-the-shelf       enterprise resource planning services.
CSC       also       signed a $151 million, 5 year contract with the Department of Defenses Missile       Defense Agency.The Company will provide scientific, engineering and       technical assistance for the U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense System.
COMPETITION The       I/T       and professional services markets in which CSC competes are not dominated by       a       single company or a small number of companies. A substantial number of companies       offer services that overlap and are competitive with those offered by the       Company. Some of these are large industrial firms, including computer       manufacturers and major aerospace firms that may have greater financial       resources than CSC and, in some cases, may have greater capacity to perform       services similar to those provided by the Company.The increased       importance of offshore labor centers has brought a number of foreign-based       firms       into competition with CSC.
CSCs       ability to obtain business is dependent upon its ability to offer better       strategic concepts and technical solutions, better value, a quicker response,       more flexibility or a combination of these factors. In the opinion of the       Companys management, CSC is positioned to compete effectively in the Global       Commercial and U.S. federal government markets based on its technology and       systems expertise and large project management skills. It is also managements       opinion that CSCs competitive position is enhanced by the full spectrum of I/T       and professional services it provides, from consulting to software and systems       design, implementation and integration, to information technology and business       process outsourcing to technical services, delivered to a broad commercial       and       government customer base.
3 EMPLOYEES The       Company has offices worldwide, and as of March 30, 2007 employed approximately       79,000 persons. The services provided by CSC require proficiency in many fields,       such as computer sciences, programming, mathematics, physics, engineering,       astronomy, geology, operations, research, economics, statistics and business       administration.

4 Item       1A. Risk Factors Past       performance may not be a reliable indicator of future financial performance.       Future performance and historical trends may be adversely affected by the       following factors, as well as other variables, and should not be relied upon       to       project future period results.
1.
Our                 business may be adversely impacted as a result of changes in demand,                 both                 globally and in individual market segments, for information technology                 outsourcing, business process outsourcing and consulting and systems                 integration services.
Economic       and political uncertainty adversely impact our customers demand for our       services. A general economic downturn may adversely impact our customers demand       for consulting and systems integration services.Our federal       government segment generated approximately 36.1% of our revenue for fiscal       2007.       While the pipeline for government projects continues to be robust, the budget       deficit, the cost of rebuilding infrastructure as a result of natural disasters       and the cost of reconstruction in Iraq may reduce the federal governments       demand for information technology projects, adversely impacting our federal       government segment and our business.
2.
Our                 ability to continue to develop and expand our service offerings to                 address                 emerging business demands and technological trends will impact our                 future                 growth. If we are not successful in meeting these business challenges                 our                 results of operations and cash flows will be materially and adversely                 affected.
Our       ability to implement solutions for our customers incorporating new developments       and improvements in technology which translate into productivity improvements       for our customers and to develop service offerings that meet the current and       prospective customers needs are critical to our success. The markets we serve       are highly competitive. Our competitors may develop solutions or services which       make our offerings obsolete. Our ability to develop and implement up to date       solutions utilizing new technologies which meet evolving customer needs in       consulting and systems integration and technology outsourcing markets will       impact our future revenue growth and earnings.

Our                 primary markets, technology outsourcing and consulting and systems                 integration, are highly competitive markets. If we are unable to                 compete                 in these highly competitive markets our results of operations will                 be                 materially and adversely                 affected.
Our       competitors include large, technically competent and well capitalized companies.       As a result, the markets which we serve are highly competitive. This competition       may place downward pressure on operating margins in our industry, particularly       for technology outsourcing contract extensions or renewals. As a result we       may       not be able to maintain our current operating margins for technology outsourcing       contracts, extended or renewed in the future.
Any       reductions in margins will require that we effectively manage our cost       structure. If we fail to effectively manage our cost structure during periods       with declining margins our results of operations will be adversely       affected.
4.
O ur                 ability to consummate and integrate acquisitions may materially and                 adversely affect our profitability if we fail to achieve anticipated                 revenue improvements and cost                 reductions.
Our       ability to successfully integrate the operations we acquire and leverage these       operations to generate revenue and earnings growth will significantly impact       future revenue and earnings. Integrating acquired operations is a significant       challenge and there is no assurance that the company will be able to manage       the       integrations successfully. Failure to successfully integrate acquired operations       may adversely affect our cost structure thereby reducing our margins and return       on investment.
5 5.
Our                 customers may experience financial difficulties and we may not be                 able to                 collect our receivables, materially and adversely affecting our                 profitability.
Over       the       course of a long-term contract our customers financial fortunes may change       affecting their ability to pay their obligations and our ability to collect       our       fees for services rendered. Additionally, we may perform work for the federal       government, for which we must file requests for equitable adjustment or claims       with the proper agency to seek recovery in whole or in part for out-of-scope       work directed or caused by the customers in support of their critical missions.       While we may resort to other methods to pursue our claims or collect our       receivables these methods are expensive and time consuming and success is not       guaranteed. Failure to collect our receivables or prevail on our claims would       have an adverse affect on our profitability.
6.
If                 we are unable to accurately estimate the cost of services and the                 timeline                 for completion of contracts the profitability of our contracts may                 be                 materially and adversely                 affected.
Our       commercial and federal government contracts are typically awarded on a       competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to       provide the services. To generate an acceptable return on our investment in       these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide       the       services required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts       in a       timely manner. If we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required       to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially       and       adversely affected.
7.
We                 are defendants in pending litigation which may have a material and                 adverse                 impact on our                 profitability.
As       noted       in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Form 10-K we are currently party to a       number of disputes which involve or may involve litigation. We are not able       to       predict the ultimate outcome of these disputes or the actual impact of these       matters on our profitability. If we agree to settle these matters or judgments       secured against us we will incur charges which may have a material and adverse       impact on our liquidity and earnings.
We       are       engaged in providing services under contracts with the U.S. Government. These       contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and, from       time to time, agencies of the U.S. Government investigate whether our operations       are being conducted in accordance with these requirements. U.S. Government       investigations of us, whether related to the Companys federal government       contracts or conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil       or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed       upon us, or could lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government       contracting.
8.
Our                 ability to provide our customers with competitive services is dependent                 on                 our ability to attract and retain qualified                 personnel.
Our       ability to grow and provide our customers with competitive services is partially       dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with       the       skills to serve our customers. As we noted above, the markets we serve are       highly competitive and competition for skilled employees in the technology       outsourcing and consulting and systems integration markets is intense for both       on-shore and off-shore locales.
6 9.
Our                 international operations are exposed to risks, including fluctuations                 in                 exchange rates, which may be beyond our                 control.
For       fiscal 2007 we earned approximately 38% of revenues in currencies other than       the       U.S. dollar. As a result we are exposed to various risks associated with       operating in multiple countries including exposure to fluctuations in currency       exchange rates. While this risk is partially mitigated by largely matching       costs       with revenues in a given currency, our exposure to fluctuations in other       currencies against the U.S. dollar increases as revenue in currencies other       than       the U.S. dollar increase and as more of the services we provide shifted to       lower       cost regions of the world. We project that the percentage of our revenue       denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar will continue to represent       a significant portion of our revenue. Also, we project that some of our ability       to match revenue and expenses in a given currency will decrease as more work       is       performed at offshore locations.
We       operate in 55 countries and our operations in these countries are subject to       the       local legal and political environments. Our operations are subject to among       other things, employment, taxation, statutory reporting, trade restrictions       and       other regulations. In spite of our best efforts we may not be in compliance       with       all regulations around the world and may be subject to penalties and or fines       as       a result. These penalties or fines may materially and adversely impact our       profitability.
10.
Our                 ability to compete in certain markets we serve is dependent on our                 ability                 to continue to expand our capacity in certain offshore                 locations.However, as our presence in these locations                 increases we are exposed to risks inherent to these locations which                 may                 adversely impact our revenue and                 profitability.
A       significant portion of our application outsourcing and software development       activities have been shifted to India and we plan to continue to expand our       presence there.As such, we are exposed to the risks inherent to       operating in India including 1) a highly competitive labor market for skilled       workers which may result in significant increases in labor costs as well as       shortages of qualified workers in the future, 2) the tax holiday granted by       certain tax jurisdictions in India to the Company, which currently extend       through 2010, may not be extended or may be revoked resulting in an increase       in       income tax expense, 3) the possibility that the U.S. federal government or       the       European Union may enact legislation which may provide significant disincentives       to customers to offshore certain of their operations which would reduce the       demand for the services we provide in India and may adversely impact our cost       structure and profitability.
11.
In                 the course of providing services to customers we may inadvertently                 infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and be exposed                 to                 claims for damages.
The       solutions we provide to our customers may inadvertently infringe on the       intellectual property rights of third parties resulting in claims for damages       against us or our customers. Our contracts generally indemnify our clients       from       claims for intellectual property infringement for the services and equipment       we       provide under our contracts. The expense and time of defending against these       claims may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability.       Additionally, the publicity we may receive as a result of infringing       intellectual property rights may damage our reputation and adversely impact       our       ability to develop new business.
12.
Generally                 our contracts contain provisions under which a customer may terminate                 the                 contract prior to completion. Early contract terminations may materially                 and adversely affect our revenues and                 profitability.
Our       contracts contain provisions by which customers may terminate the contract       prior       to completion of the term of the contract. These contracts generally allow       the       customer to terminate the contract for convenience upon providing written       notice. In these cases we seek, either by defined contract schedules or through       negotiations, recovery of our investments in the contracts. There is no       assurance we will be able to fully recover our investments.
7 We       may       not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from these contracts in the       short-term. In the long-term our reputation may be harmed by the publicity       generated from contract terminations.
13.
We                 may be exposed to negative publicity and other potential risks if                 we are                 unable to maintain effective internal                 controls.
We       are       required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to provide a report from       management to our shareholders on our internal controls over financial reporting       including an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls to provide       reasonable assurance a material misstatement did not occur in our financial       statements. The failure of our controls to provide reasonable assurance that       a       material misstatement does not exist or to detect a material misstatement may       cause us to be unable to meet our filing requirements and the resulting negative       publicity may adversely affect our business, and our stock price may be       materially and adversely affected.
14.
We                 have identified a material weakness related to accounting for income                 taxes                 and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting                 was not                 effective as of March 30, 2007.
Inability to maintain                 effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely                 affect                 our financial results, the market price of our common stock or our                 operations .
The Company has       identified a material weakness related to accounting for income taxes and,       as a       result, has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as       of       March 30, 2007 was not effective. Remediation of this material weakness may       be       costly and time consuming.Inability to maintain effective internal       control over financial reporting could adversely affect our financial results,       the market price of our common stock or our operations.
15.
Our                 largest customer, the U.S. federal government, accounts for a significant                 portion of our revenue and earnings. Inherent in the government                 contracting process are various risks which may materially and adversely                 affect our business and                 profitability.
A       significant portion of our revenue, approximately 36.1%, is derived from       contracts with the U.S. federal government. As a result our exposure to the       risks inherent in the government contracting process is material. These risks       include government audits of billable contract costs and reimbursable expenses,       project funding and requests for equitable adjustment, compliance with       government reporting requirements as well as the consequences if improper or       illegal activities are discovered.
If       any of       these should occur our reputation may be adversely impacted and our relationship       with the government agencies we work with damaged resulting in a material and       adverse affect on our profitability.
16.
Our                 ability to raise additional capital for future needs will impact                 our                 ability to compete in the markets we                 serve.
We       may       require additional capital to purchase assets, complete strategic acquisitions,       repurchase shares on the open market or for general liquidity needs. Declines       in       our credit rating or limits on our ability to sell additional shares may       adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or materially increase       our cost of capital. Our inability to raise additional capital at a reasonable       cost may adversely impact our revenue growth and the price of our       stock.
17.
As                 a result of the delayed filing of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ending                 December 29, 2006, we are currently ineligible to use Form S-3 to                 register                 securities with the SEC in capital-raising transactions, which may                 adversely affect our cost of future                 capital.
As       a       result of the delayed filing of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December       29,       2006, we are ineligible to use Form S-3 to register securities for sale by       us or       for resale by other security holders, in capital raising transactions, until       we       have timely filed all periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of       1934       for at least 12 calendar months following March 5, 2007, the date our Form       10-Q       for the quarter ended December 29, 2006 was filed.In the meantime,       for capital raising transactions we would need to use Form S-1 to register       securities with the SEC, or issue such securities in a private placement, which       could increase the costs of raising capital during this period.
8 18.
Our                 future profitability may be materially and adversely affected if                 we fail                 to execute according to plan the restructuring announced by the Company                 on                 April 4, 2006.
The       Company announced a restructuring plan in April 2006, to be carried out during       fiscal 2007 and 2008.The restructuring will result in an estimated       pre-tax charge of $440 million and have resulted in cost savings of $180 million       and an estimated $340 million during fiscal 2007 and 2008,       respectively.The majority of the restructuring activities involve       employees in central and southern Europe with certain aspects of the       restructuring subject to negotiation with employee works       councils.Additionally, certain restructured activities will be       centralized or transitioned to other locales requiring the transfer of       knowledge.If we fail to execute our restructuring plan and achieve       the cost savings we have estimated our margins and profitability will be       materially and adversely affected.
19.
Our                 performance on contracts on which we have partnered with third parties                 may                 be adversely affected if the third parties fail to deliver on their                 commitments.
Our       contracts are increasingly complex and require that we partner with parties       including software and hardware vendors to provide the complex solutions       required by our customers. Our ability to deliver the solution and provide       the       services required by our customers is dependent on the ability of our partners       to meet their delivery schedules. If our partners fail to deliver their services       or products on time our ability to complete the contract may be adversely       affected which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenue and       profitability.
If       we are       the primary contractor and our partners fail to perform as agreed we may be       liable to our customers for penalties or lost profits. These penalties or       payments for lost profits may have a material and adverse affect on our       profitability.

10 Item       3. Legal Proceedings CSC       is       engaged in providing services under contracts with the U.S.       Government.The contracts are subject to extensive legal and       regulatory requirements and, from time to time, agencies of the U.S. Government       investigate whether the Companys operations are being conducted in accordance       with these requirements.U.S. Government investigations of the       Company, whether related to the Companys federal government contracts or       conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil or criminal       liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon the       Company, or could lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government       contracting.The Company believes it has adequately reserved for any       losses which may be experienced from these investigations.
In       the       course of business, discrepancies or claims may arise as to the use or       reliability of various software products provided by the Company for its       customers.During 2005, the Company was named, along with other       vendors to the insurance industry and dozens of insurance companies in Hensley,       et al. vs. Computer Sciences Corporation, et al., filed as a putative nationwide       class action in state court in Miller County, Arkansas shortly before President       Bush signed the Class Action Fairness Act into law.The plaintiffs       allege the defendants conspired to wrongfully use software products licensed       by       the Company and the other software vendors to reduce the amount paid to the       licensees insureds for bodily injury claims.Plaintiffs also allege       wrongful concealment of the manner in which these software programs evaluate       claims and wrongful concealment of information about alleged inherent errors       and       flaws in the software.Plaintiffs seek injunctive and monetary relief       of less than $75,000 for each class member, as well as attorneys fees and       costs.The Company is vigorously defending itself against the       allegations.
Litigation       is inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome       of the matters discussed above.Considering the early stage of the       Hensley case, the complicated issues presented by that matter, and the fact       that       no class has been certified, it is not possible at this time to make meaningful       estimates of the amount or range of loss that could result from this       matter.It is possible that the Companys business, financial       condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be affected by the       resolution of this matter.Whether any losses, damages or remedies       ultimately resulting from this proceeding could reasonably have a material       effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations, or       cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including, for example, the       timing and amount of such losses or damages, if any, and the structure and       type       of any such remedies.Depending on the ultimate resolution of these       matters, some may be material to the Company's operating results for a       particular period if an unfavorable outcome results, although such a material       unfavorable result is not presently expected, and all other litigation, in       the       aggregate, is not expected to result in a material adverse impact to the       consolidated financial statements.
As       reflected by Form 8-K filings made by Sears Holdings Corporation (SHC) on May       13, 2005 (following merger with K-Mart Holding Corporation), and by the Company       on May 16, 2005, SHC's subsidiary, Sears, Roebuck and Co. (Sears), and the       Company are in dispute over amounts due and owing and applicable termination       fees following Sears' termination of its Master Services Agreement (Agreement)       with the Company on May 11, 2005. The dispute which also involves billings       for       continued services and counterclaim allegations by Sears of contract breaches       is       expected to be resolved pursuant to negotiations or legal and arbitration       proceedings. As of March 30, 2007, the Companys investment in net assets       associated with the Agreement was approximately $80 million. These net assets       include accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, outsourcing contract costs,       software, and property, plant and equipment. The Company will vigorously pursue       recovery for its associated assets and commitments. While the Company expects       full recovery of its investments associated with this Agreement, if       unsuccessful, the Company may experience a charge, which could be material,       associated with the impairment of these assets.
11 The       Company has converted 16 submitted Requests for Equitable Adjustment (REAs)       to       interest bearing claims under the Contract Disputes Act (CDA) totaling in excess       of $1 billion on two U.S. Federal contracts.Included in current       assets on the Companys balance sheet is approximately $820 million of unbilled       accounts receivable and deferred costs related to the contracts.CSC       has requested payment for certain related out-of-scope work directed or caused       by the customers in support of their critical missions.The       contractual modification process for scope changes has lagged behind the need       for CSC to provide critical on-going operational support.The Company       does not record any profit element when it defers costs associated with such       REAs/claims.The Company believes it has a legal basis for pursuing       recovery of these REAs/claims and that collection is probable with interest       on       the claims accruing but not being recognized.Settlement of the       amounts depends on individual circumstances, negotiations with the parties       and       prosecution of the claims; we are unable to predict the timing of resolution       of       these claims.
Several       shareholders of the Company have filed purported derivative actions against       both       the Company, as nominal defendant, as well as certain of CSC's executive       officers and directors. These actions generally allege that certain of the       individual defendants breached their fiduciary duty to the Company by       purportedly backdating stock options granted to CSC executives, improperly       recording and accounting for allegedly backdated stock options, producing and       disseminating disclosures that improperly recorded and accounted for the       allegedly backdated options, engaging in acts of corporate waste, and committing       violations of insider trading laws. They allege that certain of the defendants       were unjustly enriched and seek to require them to disgorge their       profits.The Company and certain directors and other individuals have       also been sued in a class action proceeding alleging violations of the ERISA       statute related to claims of alleged backdating of stock options.
In       addition to the matters noted above, the Company is currently party to a number       of disputes which involve or may involve litigation.The Company       consults with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seeks       input from other experts and advisors with respect to other matters in the       ordinary course of business.Whether any losses, damages or remedies       ultimately resulting from such other matters could reasonably have a material       effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operation,       or       cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including, for example, the       timing and amount of such losses or damages (if any) and the structure and       type       of any such remedies.For these reasons, it is not possible to make       reliable estimates of the amount or range of loss that could result from these       other matters at this time.Company management does not, however,       presently expect any of such other matters to have a material impact on the       consolidated financial statements of the Company.

As       of May       25, 2007 the number of registered shareholders of Computer Sciences       Corporations common stock was 8,441. The table shows the high and low intra-day       prices of the Companys common stock as reported on the composite tape of the       New York Stock Exchange for each quarter during the last two calendar years       and       through May 25, 2007.

Under the Companys most restrictive covenant       requirement, $4,250.6 million of retained earnings was available for cash       dividends at March 30, 2007.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of       Operations Note:The       following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and       Results of Operations has been revised for the effects of the restatement       discussed in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial       Statements.
GENERAL The       following discussion and analysis provides information management believes       is       relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of       operations and financial condition of Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC or       the       Company). The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys       consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended March       30,       2007. There are three primary objectives of this discussion: 1) to                 provide a narrative explanation of the consolidated financial statements,                 as presented through the eyes of                 management; 2) to                 enhance the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements                 and                 footnotes, providing context within which the consolidated financial                 statements should be analyzed; and 3) to                 provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive                 value of the reported financial                 results.
To       achieve these objectives, the discussion is presented in the following       sections: Overview includes       a brief description of the business and how it earns revenue and generates       cash,       as well as a discussion of the key business drivers, economic and industry       factors, fiscal 2007 highlights and fiscal 2008 commentary.
Result s o f Operations discusses year-over-year changes       to operating results for fiscal 2005 to 2007, describing the factors affecting       revenue on a consolidated and reporting segment basis, including new contracts,       acquisitions and currency impacts, and also by describing the factors affecting       changes in the major cost and expense categories.
Financia l Condition discusses causes of changes in cash flows and       describes the Companys liquidity position and available capital       resources.
Critica l Accountin g Estimates discusses accounting       policies that require critical judgments and estimates.
OVERVIEW The       Companys primary service offerings are outsourcing and I/T and professional       services. Outsourcing activities include operating all or a portion of a customers technology infrastructure and applications, and business process       outsourcing. I/T and professional services include systems integration,       consulting and other professional services and software systems sales and       related services. CSC provides these services to customers in the Global       Commercial and North American Public Sector markets. On a geographic basis,       CSC       provides services to Global Commercial customers in the United States, Europe       and other international locations. Operations in Australia, Asia and Canada       generate substantially all revenue within Other International.
Economic       and Industry Factors Global       Commercial markets are affected by various economic and industry factors. The       economic environment in the regions CSC serves will impact customers decisions       for discretionary spending on I/T projects. CSC is in a highly competitive       industry which exerts downward pressure on pricing and requires companies to       continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors,       including service offerings and flexibility. Management monitors industry       factors including relative market shares, growth rates, billing rates, staff       utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as       interest rates, inflation rates and foreign currency rates.
The       North       American Public Sector market is also highly competitive and has unique       characteristics. All U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be modified,       curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program       requirements or budgetary constraints change. In the event that a contract       is       terminated for convenience, the Company generally is reimbursed for its       allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate       amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed.       Shifting priorities of the U.S. government can also impact the future of       projects. The Company recognized the U.S. governments increased priorities on       defense and homeland security programs and has focused business development       efforts in these areas. Management monitors government priorities and industry       factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts,       legislative activity, budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating       in industry professional associations.
22 Business       Drivers Revenue       is generated by providing services on a variety of contract vehicles lasting       from less than six months to 10 years or more. Factors affecting revenue       include:  the                 Companys ability to successfully bid on and win new contract                 awards,  the                 ability to satisfy existing customers and obtain add-on business                 and win                 contract re-competes,  the                 ability to compete on price, services offered, technical ability,                 experience and flexibility,  the                 ability to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage                 them to generate new revenues,  the                 ability to successfully identify and divest non-core operations which                 may                 impact revenue in the short-term but provide resources to pursue                 longer-term growth and value creation opportunities,                 and  currency                 fluctuations related to international                 operations.
Earnings       are driven by the above revenue factors, in addition to the       following:  the                 ability to control costs, particularly labor costs, subcontractor                 expenses                 and overhead costs including healthcare, pension and general and                 administrative costs,  the                 ability to anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or                 excesses,  the                 ability to accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract                 bids and proposals, and  the                 ability to develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service                 offerings offshore.
Cash       flows are impacted by the above earnings factors, in addition to other factors       including the following:  timely                 management of receivables and                 payables,  investment                 opportunities available, particularly related to business acquisitions                 and                 dispositions and large outsourcing contracts,                 and  the                 ability to efficiently manage capital including debt and equity                 instruments.
Key       Performance Indicators The       Company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various       means, with the primary financial measures including new contract wins, revenue       growth, margins, cash flow and return on investment.
New       contract winsIn addition to being a primary driver of future revenue, focusing       on new contract wins also provides management an assessment of the Companys       ability to compete. The total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to       year       depending on the timing of new and recompeted contracts as well as numerous       external factors. CSC employs stringent financial and operational reviews and       discipline in the new contract process to evaluate risks and generate       appropriate margins and returns from new contracts.
Revenue       growthYear-over-year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins, and       reflect performance on both new and existing contracts. With a wide array of       services offered, the Company is able to pursue additional work from existing       customers. In addition, incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily       result in linear increases in costs, particularly overhead and other indirect       costs, thus potentially improving profit margins. Foreign currency fluctuations       also impact revenue growth.
MarginsMargins       reflect the Companys performance on contracts and ability to control costs.       While the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift       as a result of acquisitions or dispositions of business with different cost       profiles, a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved       efficiencies and profitability. Although the majority of the Companys costs are       denominated in the same currency as revenues, increased use of offshore support       also exposes CSC to additional margin fluctuations.
Cash       flowOver time the primary drivers of the Companys cash flow are earnings       provided by the Companys operations and the use of capital to generate those       earnings. Also contributing to short term cash flow results are movements in       current asset and liability balances. The Company also regularly reviews the       U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) cash flow measurements       of       operating, investing and financing cash flows, as well as non-GAAP free cash       flow.
23 Return       on       investment (ROI)ROI is an effective indicator combining a focus on margins with       efficient and productive net asset utilization. A combination of strong margins       (measuring how efficiently profit is generated from revenue) and investment       base       turnover (measuring how effectively revenue is generated from investors capital) is required to generate sufficient returns on capital. Strong working       capital management also serves to minimize investment capital and increase       returns.
Readers       should be cautioned that Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), free cash flow and ROI       are not GAAP measures, and the Companys definition of such measures may differ       from other companies. Therefore, such measures may not be comparable to those       of       other companies.CSC thinks these non-GAAP financial measures provide       useful information to investors regarding the Companys financial condition and       results of operations as they provide another measure of the Companys       performance and ability to service its debt.CSC calculates DSO as       follows: Total receivables at quarter-end divided by revenue-per-day.       Revenue-per-day equals total revenues for the quarter divided by the number       of       days in the fiscal quarter. Free cash flow is equal to the sum of 1) operating       cash flows, 2) investing cash flows, excluding business acquisitions and       dispositions, purchase or sale of available for sale securities and 3) capital       lease payments. ROI is calculated by multiplying profit margin times investment       base turnover. The profit margin used is profit before interest and special       items and after tax divided by revenues. Investment base turnover equals       revenues divided by average debt and equity.
Fiscal       2007 Highlights Significant       events during fiscal 2007 include:  Revenues                 rose 1.5%, though declined 0.3% on a constant currency                 basis.
The                 Company recorded a special pretax restructuring charge of $333.4                 million                 ($272.4 after tax or $1.52 per share) and a special pretax gain of                 $18.3                 million ($11.2 million after tax or 6 cents per                 share).
Legal                 and other costs associated with the stock option investigation, including                 costs incurred to obtain debt covenant waivers and employee income                 taxes                 related to the stock option investigation were $22.3 million ($15.7                 million after tax or 9 cents per                 share).
Income                 from continuing operations, including the restructuring charge, was                 $388.8                 million compared to $471.1 million for the prior year a decline of                 17.5%.
Continuing                 earnings per share, after special charges, were down 14%. The fiscal                 2007                 special charge of $1.46 per share, as compared to the prior year                 special                 charge of 26 cents per share, adversely impacted earnings per share                 from                 continuing operations compared to prior year by                 40.3%.
Announced                 contract awards of $16.9 billion with new North American Public Sector                 awards of $7.7 billion, and new Global Commercial awards totaling                 $9.2                 billion, an increase of 40% in announced awards from the prior                 year.
The                 Company entered into two accelerated share repurchase transactions                 during                 the year.In the first quarter of fiscal 2007 the Company                 acquired and retired 9.3 million shares of outstanding common shares                 for                 $500 million and during the second quarter the Company acquired and                 retired an additional 7.1 million shares for $500                 million.
Free                 cash flow of $671.5 million increased $208.6 million from $462.9                 million                 in fiscal 2006, including $207.2 million disbursed for restructuring                 activities, as well as approximately $190 million deferred income                 recognition and delayed payments on capital expenditures the magnitude                 of                 which are not representative of the Companys ongoing cash flow                 trends.
(1) (1) The                   following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly                   comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial                   measure: Fiscal                 Year Ended (in                 millions) March                 30, 2007 March                 31, 2006 April                 1, 2005 Free                 cash flow $ 671.5 $ 462.9 $ 493.9 Net                 cash used in investing activities 872.7 1,124.0 595.4 Proceeds                 from redemption of preferred stock 126.5 Acquisition,                 net of cash acquired (134.3 ) (44.1 ) (20.5 ) Business                 dispositions 2.8 .5 819.1 Capital                 lease payments 39.4 8.0 6.7 Sale                 of available-for-sale securities 46.9 Net                 cash provided by operating activities $ 1,578.6 $ 1,551.3 $ 1,941.5 24 Capital       lease payments and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment (included       in       investing activities) are included in the calculation of free cash flow. Prior       periods have been adjusted to conform with this presentation.
DSO                 was 94 days at year-end versus 87 days at the end of the prior                 year.
Debt-to-total                 capitalization ratio was 20.4% at year-end, an increase of 2.0% points                 from the prior year ratio.
ROI                 from continuing operations was 9.6% for the year a 2.1% point improvement                 from prior year.
The                 Companys significant wins during fiscal 2007 included the                 following: Global                 Commercial:  United                 Kingdom National Health Service ($3.7                 billion),  Blue                 Scope Steel ($378 million),  TDC                 ($330 million), and  UKvisas                 ($275 million).
North       American Public Sector:  U.S.                 Army Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems                 ($2.0                 billion),  U.S.                 Agency for International Development ($800                 million),  U.S                 Air Force Expeditionary Combat Support System ($378                 million),  New                 York Department of Health ($276 million),                 and  U.S.                 Department of Health and Human Services ($243                 million).
These       multi-year awards represent the estimated value of the Companys portion at       contract signing. They cannot be considered firm orders, however, due to their       variable attributes, including demand-driven usage, modifications in scope       of       work due to changing customer requirements, annual funding constraints and       indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity characteristics of major portions of       the       Companys North American Public Sector activities.
The       limited revenue growth, a decline on a constant currency basis, in the Global       Commercial sector and the decrease in awards during the first half of fiscal       2007 reflect,in part, the impact on the Companys ability to secure new       awards as a result of the Companys evaluation of strategic initiatives during       the first part of the fiscal 2007 as well as the general trend in the industry       towards smaller scope and/or shorter term outsourcing contracts.The       majority of new awards for the Global Commercial sector, with the exception       of       the National Heath Service award, were awarded during the last half of the       fiscal year. The North American Public Sector continued to win a share of       U.S. federal government contracts as its total contract awards for fiscal 2007       increased by 30% from the previous fiscal year with contract awards from the       Department of Defense continuing to lead the way. Currency shifts during fiscal       2007favorably impacted revenue and largely offset declines in constant       currency revenue in Europe.
The       Companys growth in prior years has created a broad, long-term global revenue       base across numerous customers, industries, geographic regions and service       offerings with approximately 79% of CSCs revenues derived from long-term       contracts including Global Commercial outsourcing and U.S. federal government       engagements.This revenue base provides the Company with a       relatively stable base of revenue during periods when contract awards may slow       or the market for certain services softens.
25 A       reduction in working capital was the result of an increase in payables and       deferred income which was partially offset by increases in receivables and       prepaid expenses as well as an increase in cash paid for taxes and cash paid       for       restructuring activities.The net effect was a modest increase in       cash flow from operations for fiscal 2007.The increase in deferred       income, approximately $340 million, is not expected to recur at a similar amount       during fiscal 2008.Cash out-flow for investing activities declined       from prior year as a result of lower levels of investment in outsourcing       contracts and equipment.Contributing to the decline, the Company       exited fiscal 2007 with capital expenditures unpaid and reflected in accounts       payable of approximately $110 million in excess of usual levels of such       activity.These purchases will be reported as fiscal 2008       outflows.Outflows for financing activities reflect the Companys       acquisition and retirement of 16.4 million shares of outstanding common stock       during fiscal 2007.
Fiscal       2008 Commentary As       a       leading federal contractor and one of the top I/T service providers to the       U.S.       federal government, CSCs North American Public Sector is well-positioned to       benefit from continued demand for I/T services in this market. The U.S. federal       government is one of the worlds largest I/T services consumers, and its       spending is expected to continue to increase during the upcoming year in order       to improve technologies in the areas of defense, homeland security and civil       agency modernization. While the ultimate distribution of U.S. federal funds       and       project assignments can vary, the Company expects its broad I/T and outsourcing       capabilities to be viewed favorably by the U.S. federal government.
Global       Commercial market awards during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were the       highest quarterly total during the past two fiscal years. This reversed the       trend of the four quarters preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which       were adversely impacted by the markets response to the Companys consideration       of strategic alternatives.A key success for the Company was the       award of two additional regions for the implementation of a record keeping       system for the United Kingdoms National Health Service.The awards       for commercial engagements during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 rebounded,       and the pipeline of future prospects is showing some growth. The Company has       been and will continue to be selective in new business pursuit opportunities       given the focus on margin expansion and increasing return on investment. With       respect to discretionary spending and project work, Central and Southern Europe       continue to show areas of soft demand, and demand in North America for       consulting and systems integration did not show significant improvement, while       price pressures continue. While the future demand for outsourcing services       is       not known with certainty, the long-term nature of major outsourcing engagements       allows CSC to benefit from a certain level of continuity. Growth during fiscal       2008 in Global Commercial revenue from new business awarded during fiscal 2007       is expected to be tempered by the continued demand for offshore services and       the       resulting pressure on prices.During fiscal 2007, the Companys       Global Commercial segments revenue was favorably impacted by currency       fluctuations in Europe and Other International regions. The Company cannot       forecast with certainty future movement in currency exchange rates or its impact       on operating results.
Other       trends the Company expects for fiscal 2008 are as follows:  Revenue                 for the North American Public Sector for fiscal 2008 will benefit                 from its                 $9.2 billion of announced awards.This represents a $2.2                 billion increase in awards during fiscal 2007.The North                 American Public Sector is expected to continue to grow at or above                 the                 revenue growth rate for fiscal 2007.The Company expects Global                 Commercial revenue growth to be tempered by the previous softness                 in new                 contract awards during the later part of fiscal 2006 and first half                 of                 fiscal 2007.In addition, adjustments of billing rates to                 industry benchmarks for certain significant outsourcing contracts                 awarded                 during fiscal 2005 and 2006, as these contracts mature, may also                 temper                 revenue growth for the Global Commercial segment.The demand                 for offshore services is expected to continue to increase as customers                 seek to lower costs and will present opportunity as well as temper                 revenue                 growth in Europe as well as the U.S. Commercial                 market.
The                 Company has identified and expects to pursue $29.4 billion of federal                 opportunities that will be awarded in fiscal 2008, plus an additional                 $17.3 billion during fiscal 2009. The Company expects to win a share                 of                 these awards.
26  Cash                 flow from operations for fiscal 2008 is expected to decrease slightly                 from                 the $1,578.6 million for fiscal 2007.Fiscal 2008 operating                 cash flow is expected to be adversely impacted by a decline in deferred                 income.
Cash                 outflow from investing activities is expected to increase from fiscal                 2007                 levels primarily as a result of investment in computers and related                 equipment in the U.S. Commercial and North American Public Sector                 and for                 capital assets acquired in fiscal 2007 but paid for during fiscal                 2008.
The       Companys overall short-term financial objectives include: 1.
Successfully                 launch the new contracts won during fiscal                 2007.
2.
Manage                 ongoing engagements to maximize revenue and                 margins.
3.
Successfully                 close and integrate the acquisition of Covansys                 Corporation.
4.
Effectively                 manage working capital and capital                 investment.
5.
Maintain                 appropriate investment base turnover rates and operating margins,                 with                 particular emphasis on the new business, in order to improve return                 on                 investment.
6.
Pursue                 the current pipeline of commercial and North American Public Sector                 opportunities and win a proportionate                 share.
7.
Continue                 execution of the restructuring plan begun in fiscal                 2007.

Focus                 on aggressively growing and leveraging its India                 capabilities.The Company has launched an India Direct Sales                 channel to address customers needs for pure offshore services and to                 compete directly against low cost, offshore IT providers.The                 Company has been making and will continue to make investments to                 build out                 its India delivery capabilities for remote infrastructure management,                 application services, and business process offerings.Its                 pursuit and pending acquisition of Covansys Corporation signifies                 the                 Companys commitment to expanding offshore selling and delivery                 capabilities in India.When this acquisition closes, the                 Company will have more than 14,000 employees in India, and India                 will be                 its second largest country of                 employment.
Focus                 on further expanding its global footprint.The Company                 currently operates in more than 55 countries and serves some of the                 worlds largest global companies.It delivers to the world from                 around the world.Consequently, the Company is continuing its                 commitment to world sourcing as an important value component of its                 global                 delivery model.It will continue to offer clients the mix of                 on-shore, near-shore and offshore services most appropriate to their                 needs.The Company is particularly focused on expanding                 capabilities in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe, in addition                 to                 India.
Focus                 on commercial outsourcing and further strengthen the Companys ability to                 deliver the services its clients require consistently and seamlessly                 across their global enterprise.Also, the Company is investing                 to win a higher share of mid-size deals  those having total contract                 values between $50 and $350 million by launching a dedicated sales                 team                 and enhancing delivery capabilities to address this large and growing                 market segment.
27  Focus                 on the North American Public Sector market.The Company will                 build on an established market position by enhancing its offerings                 to core                 markets and investing in selected higher growth sub-segments such                 as                 identity management and credentialing, health services, and logistics                 and                 transportation.Additionally, the Company will look to expand                 the work it does for the public sector in Canada and to build upon                 its                 success with the U.S. federal government in the pursuit of selected                 state                 and local growth opportunities.
These       five initiatives will be supported by a disciplined acquisition       strategy.This acquisition approach is focused on vertical markets       and core delivery capabilities, directed towards higher growth and margin       businesses and strictly aligned with the priorities of Project       Accelerate.

RESULTS       OF OPERATIONS Revenues Revenues       for the Global Commercial and North American Public Sector segments (see Note       16       to the consolidated financial statements) for fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and       fiscal 2005 are as follows: Fiscal                 2007 Fiscal                 2006 Fiscal                 2005 Amount Percent Change Amount Percent Change Amount As                 Restated As                 Restated U.S.                 Commercial $ 3,872.9 (4.3 )% $ 4,047.7 5.1 % $ 3,851.1 Europe 4,146.3 (.7 ) 4,176.8 (3.4 ) 4,325.7 Other                 International 1,487.1 9.3 1,360.5 10.9 1,227.3 Global                 Commercial sector 9,506.3 (.8 ) 9,585.0 1.9 9,404.1 North                 American Public sector 5,350.3 5.9 5,054.0 8.1 4,675.9 Corporate Total $ 14,856.6 1.5 $ 14,639.0 4.0 $ 14,080.0 The       major       factors affecting the percent change in revenues are presented as       follows: Fiscal                 2007 vs. Fiscal 2006 Approximate                 Impact of                 Currency Fluctuations Net                 Internal Growth Total U.S.                 Commercial (4.3 )% (4.3 )% Europe 5.2 % (5.9 ) (.7 ) Other                 International 3.3 6.0 9.3 Global                 Commercial sector 2.7 (3.5 ) (.8 ) North                 American Public sector 5.9 5.9 Corporate Total 1.8 (.3 ) 1.5 28 Fiscal                 2006 vs. Fiscal 2005 Approximate                 Impact of                 Currency Fluctuations Net                 Internal Growth Total U.S.                 Commercial 5.1 % 5.1 % Europe (3.5 )% .1 (3.4 ) Other                 International 2.5 8.4 10.9 Global                 Commercial sector (1.3 ) 3.2 1.9 North                 American Public sector 8.1 8.1 Corporate Total (.8 ) 4.8 4.0 Fiscal       2007 revenue growth from Department of Defense contracts in the North American       Public Sector and growth in Other International operations helped offset the       impact of 1) terminated commercial contracts with Nortel Networks and Sears,       2)       the impact of a decline in commercial awards during fiscal 2006 and early 2007       in U.S. Commercial and Europe operations and 3) reduced scope on an intelligence       agency program. The decline in Global Commercial revenue for fiscal 2007 of       0.8%       (a decline of 3.5% in constant currency) was the result of terminated       engagements in U.S. Commercial operations and reductions in scope on a number       of       contracts in Europe offset by growth in our Australian and Asia       operations.Other International operations benefited from growth on       existing business as a result of successful recompete efforts on contracts       in       Australia and additional project work on contracts in Asia. The North American       Public Sector revenue growth benefited from growth on existing programs,       contracts awarded during fiscal 2007 and from the acquisition, in the third       quarter, of an identity management and credentialing business.These       positive factors offset the effects of programs with reduced scopes as noted       above.
Fiscal       2006 revenue growth from significant new commercial engagements and Federal       programs offset the impact of 1) terminated commercial contracts with Nortel       Networks and JPMorgan Chase, 2) revised billing rates for extended contracts,       3)       reduced scope on certain Federal programs and 4) wind down of the development       phase on a significant government project. Global Commercial growth for fiscal       2006 of 1.9% (3.2% in constant currency) was led by U.S. Commercial operations       where new outsourcing engagements, growth on existing outsourcing engagements       and growth in the U.S. consulting and systems integration business offset       terminated engagements and lower billing rates on extended engagements. Other       International operations benefited from growth on existing business. Europe       operations, in constant currency, were unchanged from the prior year. The U.S.       Federal sector revenue growth benefited from contracts awarded during fiscal       2006 and 2005 and from growth on existing programs offsetting the effects of       programs with reduced scopes as noted above.
Global       Commercial Revenue       from Global Commercial declined in fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year with       revenue 0.8% below prior year and on a constant currency basis 3.5% below prior       year.Declines in new contract awards during fiscal 2006 and the       early 2007, the termination of certain U.S. Commercial contracts, declines       in       revenue from mature contracts in Europe and continued soft demand for consulting       and systems integration offerings were partially offset by growth in Australia       and Asia.
U.S.       Commercial revenues decreased $175 million for fiscal 2007, or 4.3%. The decline       was primarily the result of the termination of the Sears, Roebuck & Co and       Nortel Networks contracts, which combined contributed an additional $205 million       of revenue in the prior year.These declines were partially offset by       revenue growth on existing outsourcing contracts.Revenue in the       consulting and systems integration business was unchanged from the prior year       as       the increase in demand for these services in the prior year did not carry       forward into fiscal 2007. No significant new contracts contributed to growth       in       U.S. Commercial business for fiscal 2007.
During       fiscal 2007 Europe revenues decreased $31 million or 0.7% and on a constant       currency basis decreased $246 million or 5.9% from the prior       year.Growth from outsourcing and I/T and professional services       engagements with U.K. National Health Service and Public Sector Scandinavia       combined for $58 million in revenue growth and favorable currency effects,       which       contributed $214 million, were offset by revenue declines as a result of       reductions in the scope of work for certain outsourcing engagements of       $155million in Northern Europe, the termination of the Nortel Networks       contract, a decline in software license sales and continued softness in demand       for the Companys consulting and systems integration services in Germany and       Italy.
29 Other       International revenues increased $127 million or 9.3%, 6.0% in constant       currency, during fiscal 2007. Australian operations contributed $84 million       of       revenue growth attributable to a professional staffing business, a major       outsourcing contract and success in winning a number of recompete contracts       during fiscal 2007.This growth was offset somewhat by the expiration       of a government contract. Asia contributed $59 million in revenue growth       attributable to additional work on various outsourcing       engagements.This growth was offset somewhat by a decline in revenue       from Canada operations, primarily as a result of the termination of the Nortel       Networks contract.
During       fiscal 2006 revenue from Global Commercial grew 1.9% or 3.2% in constant       currency. New major engagements contributed approximately $483 million to Global       Commercials revenue growth for fiscal 2006. These engagements, although       primarily for outsourcing services, include other I/T and professional services       as well. Revenue from existing engagements declined for fiscal 2006 as growth       in       U.S. consulting and systems integration services and in Other International       was       offset by lower billing rates on a contract extension, reduced volume on certain       contracts, the termination and wind-down of certain contracts such as Nortel       Networks, Sears, and JPMorgan Chase and a decline in software license       sales.
U.S.       Commercial revenues increased $197 million for fiscal 2006, or 5.1%. The growth       was primarily from outsourcing contracts awarded during fiscal 2005 and growth       in the consulting and systems integration business. New contracts contributing       to the growth were Sun, Ascension Health, Textron and Aon which when combined,       contributed $279 million to revenue growth for fiscal 2006. This revenue growth       and the contribution from U.S. consulting and systems integration were partially       offset by reduced volumes and billing rates on certain significant outsourcing       contracts and the termination of significant outsourcing contracts with Nortel       Networks and JPMorgan Chase. The Companys contract with Sears, Roebuck & Co. for outsourcing services, which was terminated during fiscal 2006, provided       $131 million of revenue during fiscal 2006.
Other       International revenues increased $133 million or 10.9%, 8.4% in constant       currency, during fiscal 2006. Australian operations contributed $62 million       of       revenue growth attributable to a professional staffing business and a major       outsourcing contract, offset somewhat by the termination of an outsourcing       contract. Asia contributed $50 million in revenue growth attributable to various       outsourcing engagements.
During       fiscal 2006 Europe revenues decreased $149 million or 3.4% though were       essentially unchanged on a constant currency basis. Growth from new outsourcing       and I/T and professional services engagements with U.K. National Health Service,       Zurich Financial Services and Renault of $184 million was offset by unfavorable       currency movements of approximately $152 million, reduced scope of work on       certain outsourcing engagements, reduced billing rates on a contract extension,       a decline in software license sales and continued softness in demand for the       Companys consulting and systems integration services in Germany and       Italy.
North       American Public Sector The       Companys North American Public sector revenues were derived from the following       sources: Fiscal                 2007 Fiscal                 2006 Fiscal                 2005 Dollars                 in millions Amount Percent                 Change Amount Percent Change Amount Department                 of Defense $ 3,593.8 6.7 % $ 3,368.9 15.8 % $ 2,909.8 Civil                 agencies 1,600.1 3.6 1,544.3 (4.3 ) 1,612.9 Other (1) 156.4 11.1 140.8 (8.1 ) 153.2 Total                 North American PublicSector $ 5,350.3 5.9 $ 5,054.0 8.1 $ 4,675.9 (1) Other                 revenues consist of foreign, state and local government work as well                 as                 commercial contracts performed by the North American Public sector                 segment.
30 North       American Public Sector revenue growth for fiscal 2007 was 5.9% with revenue       up       $296 million to $5,350.3 million. The revenue growth was the result of new       business awarded during fiscal 2007 and 2006, increases on existing Department       of Defense contracts and the acquisition in the third quarter of an identity       management and credentialing business. This growth was partially offset by       reductions in funding for one other significant program as funds were redirected       to other Department of Defense programs.The North American Public       Sector continued to win significant new business during fiscal 2007 with       announced new U.S. federal contract awards of $9.2 billion versus $7.1 billion       for fiscal 2006 and $7.0 billion for fiscal 2005.
Department       of Defense revenue increased $225 million or 6.7% to $3,593.8 million for fiscal       2007. Growth was the result of increased demand for equipment procurement and       installation services for the U.S. Army, a program to provide engineering       support services to the U.S. Armys Aviation and Missile Command, an increase in       scope for a program to provide mission support services,a new       program to provide engineering logistics and business operations services to       the       U.S. Army, management services for certain intelligence services, a program       to       provide flight simulation services to the U.S. Army and the acquisition of       an       identity management and credentialing business in the third quarter. These       new programs, tasking and acquisition provided approximately $292 million in       revenue growth for fiscal 2007.This growth was partially offset by       funding shortfalls on an intelligence services program as funds were redirected       to other programs and revenue declined $70 million on this program.
Civil       agencies revenue increased $56 million or 3.6% versus fiscal 2006, as a result       of increased activity on a contract with the Federal Aviation Administration,       and I/T engineering and management services contract with the EPA as well as       growth in consulting services provided to various agencies.
Work       performed by the North American Public Sector for state and local governments       as       well as commercial clients was $156 million for fiscal 2007, an increase of       $16       million from the prior year. This increase was the result of achievement of       milestones on a project with a foreign government to provide information       technology services.This increase was partially offset by a       reduction in revenue on a contract with the New York Department of Health where       the contract evolved from system development to run and maintain and system       enhancement work.
For       fiscal 2006 North American Public Sector revenue growth was 8.1% with revenue       up       $378 million to $5,054 million. The revenue growth was driven by new business       awarded during fiscal 2006 and 2005 and increases on existing Department of       Defense contracts. This growth was partially offset by the completion of the       development phase on a state contract and reduced scope on a small number of       significant programs. The North American Public Sector continued to win       significant new business during fiscal 2006 with announced new U.S. federal       contract awards of $7.1 billion versus $7.0 billion for fiscal 2005 and $5.0       billion for fiscal 2004.
Department       of Defense revenue increased $459 million or 15.8% to $3,369 million for fiscal       2006. Growth was the result of increased demand for equipment procurement and       installation services for the U.S. Army, a new program to provide aviation       support services, new tasking on programs to provide logistical support to       the       U.S. Army, new tasking to provide technical support for the Navys undersea test       facilities, a multiple award contract to provide professional services to Naval       Sea Systems Command, a new program to provide support services for the U.S.       Strategic Command and I/T engineering and management services for certain       intelligence services. These new programs and tasking provided approximately       $297 million in revenue growth for fiscal 2006. The remainder of the revenue       increase during fiscal 2006 was the result of normal contract activities       including new tasking on various projects and various new programs.
For       fiscal 2006 Civil agencies revenue was down $69 million or 4.3% versus fiscal       2005, driven by the reduction in scope for a significant project with the       Internal Revenue Service. The impact of the scope reduction on this project       was       approximately $72 million. New tasking on projects for the National Aeronautics       and Space Administration (NASA) offset scope reductions and the completion       of       other programs.
Work       performed by the North American Public Sector for state and local governments       as       well as commercial clients was $141 million for fiscal 2006, down $12 million.       The decrease was the result, primarily, of a reduction of effort on a contract       with the New York Department of Health. This was offset somewhat by a project       with a foreign government to provide information technology       services.
31 Costs       and Expenses The       Companys costs and expenses were as follows: Dollar                 Amount Percentage                 of Revenue 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 As                 Restated As                 Restated Costs                 of services (excludes depreciation                 and amortization) $ 11,817.8 $ 11,724.0 $ 11,320.1 79.5 % 80.1 % 80.4 % Selling,                 general and administrative 916.4 862.5 856.7 6.2 5.9 6.1 Depreciation                 and amortization 1,073.6 1,091.8 1,051.0 7.2 7.5 7.5 Interest                 expense, net 125.7 80.1 143.3 .8 .5 1.0 Special                 items 316.1 77.3 28.6 2.1 .5 .2 Total $ 14,249.6 $ 13,835.7 $ 13,399.7 95.9 % 94.5 % 95.2 % The       Company substantially matches revenues and costs in the same currency.       Therefore, foreign currency did not have a material impact on costs and expenses       as a percentage of revenue. However, the Company is increasing its use of       offshore support and therefore may be exposed to additional margin       fluctuations.
Costs       and       expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2007 increased 1.4% points to       95.9% from 94.5% for fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of costs incurred from       restructuring activities which contributed 2.4% to the total cost       ratio.The cost of services ratio decreased as a result of       restructuring activities during fiscal 2007 and cost management while the       depreciation and amortization ratio decreased as a result of the termination       of       the Nortel Networks and Sears contracts both of which were capital intensive       contracts.The selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense       ratio increased as a result of 1) professional fees and employee taxes to be       paid by the Company as a result of the stock option investigation, and 2) the       SG&A portion of additional compensation expense incurred as a result of the       adoption of SFAS No. 123R during fiscal 2007.The interest expense       ratio increased as a result of financing a repurchase of shares with commercial       paper, an increase in interest expense related to income taxes and an increase       in assets under capital leases.
Costs       and       expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2006 improved .7% points to       94.5%       from 95.2% for fiscal 2005 with most ratios improved or unchanged from the       prior       year. The cost of services ratio decreased as a result of cost management and       certain revenue settlements for which the associated costs were recorded in       a       prior period. The interest expense ratio decreased primarily as the result       of       the retirement of $1 billion of term debt during March 2005. These decreases       were offset by the impairment charge and loss on sale of equipment due to the       termination of portions of the Nortel Networks contract recorded as a special       item in fiscal 2006.
Costs       of Services Costs       of       services as a percentage of revenue decreased .6% points to 79.5% for fiscal       2007 as a result of a decrease in the Global Commercial ratio of 1.2% points       to       75.7% and a .1% point decrease in the North American Public Sector ratio to       86.2%.Improvements in the cost of services ratio for the Global       Commercial segment were primarily in the outsourcing business in the United       States and Asia, as a result of cost savings initiatives, restructuring       activities and the termination of low margin contracts.
The       Global Commercial cost of services ratio for fiscal 2007 benefited from       reductions in the ratio in U.S. Commercial operations, where the ratio improved       2.1% points as a result of cost savings initiatives during the past year, the       transfer of certain tasks to lower cost regions for certain contracts, and       the       termination of low margin contracts.The ratio for Other       International operations improved 1.6% points as Asia benefited from       restructuring activities.These improvements in the cost of services       ratio for Other International were partially offset by significant revenue       growth from a low margin professional staffing business in       Australia.Europe, where the ratio decreased .7% points, benefited       from reductions in the cost of services ratio as a result of the transfer of       certain tasks to lower cost regions, the impact of restructuring activities       on       the ratio in the consulting and systems integration activities and a reduction       in management bonuses.These reductions in expense were somewhat       offset by higher costs on certain outsourcing engagements.
32 The       North       American Public Sector ratio for fiscal 2007 benefited from the impact of an       adverse estimate to complete incurred on a state project in the prior year       and a       revenue increase on this contract during the current year as a result of the       client extending the contract.These changes combined for .4% points       favorable impact to the ratio for fiscal 2007.This favorable impact       was partially offset by an adverse cost incurred for contracts with the IRS       of       .2% points during fiscal 2007.These changes, combined, had a .1%       point favorable impact on the overall cost of services ratio.
Costs       of       services as a percentage of revenue decreased .3% points to 80.1% for fiscal       2006 as a result of a decrease in the Global Commercial ratio of .2% points       to       76.9% and a .4% points decrease in the North American Public Sector ratio to       86.3%. The ratio for fiscal 2006 benefited, as noted below, from cost of       services amounts carried at the Corporate level for fiscal 2005 which included       $24 million of accrued cost related to the settlement of an overtime pay class       action lawsuit.
The       Global Commercial cost of services ratio for fiscal 2006 benefited from       reductions in the ratio in Europe as a result of outsourcing improvements in       the       United Kingdom offset somewhat by higher ratios for other European consulting       and systems integration business. These improvements in Europe were offset       by a       higher ratio for U.S. outsourcing as a result of start up and termination       activities and an unfavorable mix impact as revenue from higher margin software       license sales was lower for the year. The costs of services ratio benefited       from       certain revenue items such as revenue settlements with clients for which the       related costs were recognized in a prior period, a pre-tax $8 million gain       from       the sale of a building and the novation of certain contracts. These items       favorably benefited the ratio approximately .2% points.
The       North       American Public Sector ratio for fiscal 2006 benefited from increased margins       for certain time and materials contracts on subcontractor work and materials       and       cost containment on a fixed unit price contract. The year over year comparison       also benefited .2% points from unfavorable adjustments during fiscal 2005 on       certain programs for which recovery of costs was not probable. These factors       were somewhat offset by an adverse estimate to complete incurred on a state       project impacting the ratio by approximately (.1%) point.
Selling,       General and Administrative Selling,       general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of revenue       increased .3% points to 6.2% for fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of additional       compensation expense due to the incremental impact of the adoption of SFAS       No.       123(R) and the legal expenses related to the investigation by the Securities       and       Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice into the Companys stock       option granting practices.These items had a .3% point net       unfavorable impact on the expense ratio for fiscal 2007.The pretax       incremental stock option expense recorded in SG&A as a result of the       adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) was approximately $14.2 million ($10.0 million       net       of taxes) and the pre-tax legal and related expenses related to the stock option       investigation, including employee taxes to be paid by the company, were       approximately $22.3 million ($15.7 million net of tax).The       comparison of the fiscal 2007 ratio to the prior year ratio benefited from       a       one-time adverse impact to the prior year ratio for a provision for doubtful       accounts, as noted below, which had a .1% point impact on the expense ratio       for       fiscal 2006.The allocation of the SFAS No. 123(R) and legal       expenses, noted above, for fiscal 2007 resulted in an increase in the North       American Public Sector expense ratio of .5% points and an increase in the Global       Commercial ratio of .2% points.
Selling,       general and administrative (SG&A) expenses of 5.9% as a percentage of       revenue for fiscal 2006 decreased .2% points from the prior year primarily       as a       result of a decrease in income tax penalties as compared to prior year of       approximately $40 million partially offset by additional compensation expense       of       $16.4 million (approximately $12.1 million net of taxes).The       decrease in the ratio was the result of a decrease in the ratio for the       corporate segment as a result of the decrease in tax penalties partially offset       by an increase in the ratio for the North American Public Sector of .5% points.       The North American Public Sector ratio increase was attributable to increased       expenses in the new business development area and increased management and       bid       and proposal costs. The Global commercial ratio was essentially flat to the       prior year as improvements in the ratio from savings in new business selling       costs due to fewer significant new business opportunities and a reduction in       general and administrative costs was offset by the increase in compensation       costs as a result of the restatement noted above and the adverse impact of       a       pre-tax $18 million provision for doubtful accounts related to negotiations       with       an outsourcing customer regarding certain contract provisions.
33 Depreciation       and Amortization Depreciation       and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue decreased .3% points to       7.2%       during fiscal 2007.The expense ratio improved in both the North       American Public Sector and in Global Commercial. The decrease in the expense       ratio was the result of revenue growth and a decline in depreciation and       amortization expense to $1,073.6 million for fiscal 2007.This       decline was the result of an approximately $20 million decrease in depreciation       expense for fiscal 2007 due primarily to the termination and disposal of the       related assets for the Searscontract and a shift in the mix of the assets       in Australia toward longer lived assets.The North American Public       Sector ratio decreased by .2% points as depreciation and amortization expense       was held flat and revenue increased by 5.9%.The Global Commercial       ratio decreased .2% point due to the reduction in expense noted above while       revenues were essentially flat to the prior year.
Depreciation       and amortization expense of $1,091.8 million for fiscal 2006 represents 7.5%       of       revenue and was unchanged from the ratio of 7.5% for fiscal 2005. Improvement       in       the North American Public Sector ratio was offset by an increase in the Global       Commercial ratio. The North American Public Sector ratio decreased by .1% point       predominantly due to decreases in amortization of certain intangibles acquired       in the Dyncorp acquisition. The Global Commercial ratio increased as a result       of       significant upfront capital investment for outsourcing contracts awarded during       fiscal 2005 and 2004 in Europe and Asia and capital refreshes necessary on       some       existing contracts, offset by lower levels of capital investment for U.S.       commercial operations due to the termination of the Nortel and Sears contracts       and a favorable mix variance from Australian operations due to revenue growth       in       non-capital intensive business lines.
Interest       Expense and Interest Income The       increase in interest expense for fiscal 2007 of $54.3 was the result, primarily,       of three factors: 1)the use ofcommercial paper to       finance the accelerated share repurchase transactions (see Note 11 in the Notes       to Consolidated Financial Statements) which increased interest from commercial       paper by $19.7 million for fiscal 2007, 2) an increase in equipment under       capital leases, particularly in the North American Public Sector, resulted       in an       increase in interest expense of $13.0 million, and 3) interest accrued related       to income taxes and income tax contingency items of $18.7 million (see Note       2 in       the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).Interest income       increased approximately $8.7 million for fiscal 2007 as a result of an increase       in interest income from tax refund items, interest income from a partnership       and       interest on cash balances in Asia and Canada.These increases offset       the loss of dividend income from the DynCorp International 13% preferred stock       which was redeemed during the first quarter of fiscal 2007.The       result of the increase in interest expense and interest income was an increase       in net interest expense of $34 million and an increase in the interest expense       ratio of .2% points.
The       decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was due       to       lower average debt levels during fiscal 2006 as the result of the retirement       of       $1 billion of term debt during March 2005. The interest savings from the       retirement of the term debt was somewhat offset by an increase in interest       expense for income taxes, capitalized leases and short-term borrowings for       working capital needs in Europe. The combination of these factors resulted       in a       reduction in interest expense of $38.5 million. In addition, interest income,       including dividend income from the DynCorp International 13% preferred stock,       increased approximately $24.7 million for fiscal 2006 resulting in a .6%       improvement in the net interest expense ratio. During May 2006, the Company       received approximately $169 million from DynCorp International for the       redemption of the preferred stock and payment of cumulative dividends of       approximately $22.5 million.
Special       Items Special       items totaling $316.1 million were recorded during the year ended March 30,       2007, and consisted of:(1) a$333.4 million restructuring       charge (see discussion below), (2) a $1.0 million true-up of an estimate related       to the fiscal 2006 Nortel impairment charge and (3) an $18.3 million gain from       the redemption of DynCorp International preferred stock.
Restructuring In       April       2006, the Company announced a restructuring plan to be carried out during fiscal       2007 and 2008.The objectives of the plan are to 1) streamline CSCs       worldwide operations and 2) leverage the increased use of lower cost global       resources.Restructuring charges consist predominantly of severance       and related employee payments resulting from terminations.During the       third quarter of fiscal 2007 the Company evaluated facility consolidation       opportunities and other areas where operations can be streamlined and costs       reduced consistent with the plan objectives, resulting in additional lease       termination, asset impairment and other charges.
34 Workforce       reductions of approximately 4,400 employees occurred in fiscal 2007, and an       additional 1,100 reductions are planned for fiscal 2008. Termination-related       charges of $294.3 million were recorded in fiscal 2007. Other, primarily vacant       space-related costs, of $39.1 million were also recorded during the year, net       of       an $11.6 million gain on the sale of a data center facility. All but       approximately $.1 million of the restructuring charge was incurred in the Global       Commercial reporting segment. Additional restructuring charges of not more       than       $110 million are expected to be incurred in fiscal 2008.
The       restructuring plan generated savings of approximately $180million in       fiscal 2007 and is expected to result in savings of $340 million in fiscal       2008.       Approximately 97% of the savings comes from reduced cost of services, while       the       remainder will be predominantly from lower selling, general and administrative       costs. Savings are net of new or increased recurring costs, primarily the costs       anticipated for an increasing offshore workforce. Savings will also be impacted       by certain transitional costs as new offshore staff are trained while outgoing       staff are still on the payrolls. Such transitional costs were under $10 million       in fiscal 2007 and expected to be under $2 million in fiscal 2008.
A       majority of the planned headcount reductions (3,000 in fiscal 2007 and 500       in       2008) were scheduled to take place in Europe.Approximately 1,100 and       500 positions were to be reduced in North America in fiscal 2007 and 2008,       respectively, with the balance in Australia and Asia. Partially offsetting       the       reductions were planned headcount increases in certain lower cost regions of       approximately 1,400 and 700 employees in fiscal 2007 and 2008,       respectively.As of March 30, 2007, approximately 4,400 separations       have been completed (approximately one-sixth due to attrition), with 3,000       in       Europe, 1,100 in North America and the remainder in Australia and       Asia.Approximately 2,100 new hires occurred in lower cost regions       during the full year ended March 30, 2007, including replacements of some of       the       4,400 reductions as well as for previously-planned and on-going business       activities.
The       Companys strategy in Europe has been to obtain negotiated, voluntary       terminations to the extent possible, but involuntary terminations were also       necessary in certain countries to attain targeted reductions. Outside of Europe,       terminations have been predominantly involuntary. Involuntary termination       benefits are determined in accordance with existing company policies and local       legal requirements. In some countries, local regulations require the Company       to       consult with employee representatives such as works councils or unions in the       determination of job categories and number of employees to be terminated, as       well as the resulting termination benefit amounts.
The       amounts of termination benefits are typically attributable to employees services already rendered and increase as length of service increases. The       Company records charges for negotiated, voluntary terminations at the time       an       employee accepts the Companys offer. Involuntary termination benefits are       accrued at the time such obligations are considered probable and reasonably       estimable. Such a calculation is based on estimates of benefit payouts as well       as number and type of staff to be terminated. In cases where a plan calls for       first attempting to garner voluntary terminations and then moves to involuntary       terminations if targeted reductions are not achieved, a charge is accrued based       on estimated involuntary benefits for all remaining reductions.
Accruals       for future termination benefits are based on a number of assumptions and       estimates. Such accruals may differ from actual results for a variety of       reasons, including: different benefit amounts or mix of employees as a result       of       completed employee representative consultations; additional voluntary       terminations in lieu of accrued involuntary terminations; changes in mix of       actual terminated employees by age, years of service, or job class.
Restructuring-related       pre-tax cash payments of approximately $207.2 million were made in fiscal 2007       (excluding $25.8 million cash proceeds received from sale of a data center)       and       are estimated to be approximately $195 millionfor fiscal       2008.Included in the restructuring charge are pension benefit       augmentations that are due to certain employees in accordance with legal or       contractual obligations, which will be paid out over several years as part       of       normal pension distributions. Such liabilities are included in the consolidated       pension liability account.

During       fiscal 2006 Nortel Networks (Nortel) terminated the Companys services for       certain information technology outsourcing activities under the outsourcing       agreement between Nortel and the Company. As a result of the termination of       these services the Company recorded a non-cash special charge of $52.0 million       in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 to write down outsourcing contract costs       and certain equipment associated with the contract to their estimated fair       value. The Company recorded an additional charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal       2006 of $25.3 million to write down the remaining assets to fair value,       recognize a loss on the assets sold to Nortel under the terms of the termination       settlement, record severance costs for those employees who were not hired by       Nortel or redeployed within the Company and record costs associated with       terminating the contract for a total charge of $77.3 million ($48.3 million       after tax) or 26 cents per share.
During       the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the Company recorded a charge of $29.5 million       for premium payments and the write down of deferred financing costs and interest       discount related to the early redemption of $1 billion of term debt. The Company       elected to make this early redemption and incur the charges as it had available       cash and these debt issues carried interest rates above current prevailing       rates. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further       description. The debt redemption charge was partially offset by the reversal       in       the fourth quarter of previously recorded facility restructuring accruals of       $.9       million. The combined special items had a $0.10 per share impact on earnings       per       share and a .2% net impact on the Companys profit margin in fiscal       2005.
Taxes The       provision for taxes on continuing operations as a percentage of pre-tax earnings       was 35.9%, 41.4% and 34.7% for fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005,       respectively.The decrease in the effective tax rate during fiscal 2007 as       compared to fiscal 2006 was the result of lower state tax and additional credits       in fiscal 2007, partially offset by higher foreign effective tax       rates.The Companys income tax expense for fiscal 2007 includes a       reduction for a change in estimate in the amount of approximately $24 million       of       research and development credits available to be claimed by the Company for       years prior to fiscal 2007. As a result of these factors, the effective       tax rate for fiscal 2007 declined 5.5% percentage points from fiscal       2006.The increase in fiscal 2006 income tax expense compared to       fiscal 2005 was primarily the result a reduction in tax contingency recorded       in       fiscal 2005 which did not recur in fiscal 2006.See Note 8 to the       consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income       taxes.
36 Discontinued       Operations Income       from discontinued operations net of taxes was $61.3 million and $313.8 million,       respectively, for fiscal years 2006 and 2005.Income from       discontinued operations during fiscal 2006 included the gain on sale of Health       Plan Solutions of $22.9 million and the gain from the working capital adjustment       for the sale of DynCorp International of $38.4 million. The Company received       $65.5 million par value preferred stock for the working capital adjustment       and       recorded taxes of $20.7 million and a valuation allowance of approximately       $6.5       million against the preferred stock. Income from discontinued operations during       fiscal 2005 includes the net after tax gain on the sale of DynCorp International       of $228.8 million or approximately $1.19 per share. In fiscal 2005, proceeds       from the sale included $775 million of cash and $75 million of par value       preferred stock. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2005 included the operations       of DynCorp International, sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and       the       operations of Health Plan Solutions which was classified as held for sale as       of       April 1, 2005 and sold during the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
Cumulative       Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In       March       2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation       No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligationsan       interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. During fiscal 2006, the Company       recorded a Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle of $5.6 million       ($4.3 million after tax) or $0.02 per share as a result of implementing the       Interpretation to account for the Companys unrecorded legal obligations to       restore some of its leased facilities to their original condition upon lease       expiration.
Earnings       Per Share and Share Base Earnings       per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal       2006       decreased $0.35 to $2.16. Earnings per share from continuing operations for       fiscal 2007 were adversely impacted by special charges of $1.46 per share and       favorably impacted by a decrease in the average share base of 8.3 million shares       from fiscal 2006. This decline in the share base was the result of the Companys       acquisition and retirement of 16.4 million shares through two accelerated share       repurchase transactions with 9.3 million shares acquired during the first       quarter and 7.1 million shares acquired during the second quarter of fiscal       2007.See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for       further discussion of these transactions.This reduction to the share       base was partially offset by option exercises during the past twelve months       and       an increase in common stock equivalents of 1.2 million for fiscal       2007.
Earnings       per share from continuing operations increased $0.20 to $2.51 for fiscal 2006.       Earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 were adversely       impacted by special charges of $0.26 per share and a decrease in income from       continuing operations and favorably impacted by a decline in the average share       base of 4.1 million shares for fiscal 2006. This decline in the share base       was       driven primarily by the Companys acquisition of 7.13 million treasury shares in       the HPS exchange which reduced weighted average shares outstanding by 6.6       million shares for fiscal 2006. This reduction was partially offset by employee       stock option exercises during fiscal 2006. Common stock equivalents declined       slightly on a year over year basis.
FINANCIAL       CONDITION Cash       Flows Dollars                 in millions Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Net                 cash from operations $ 1,578.6 $ 1,551.3 $ 1,941.5 Net                 cash used in investing (872.7 ) (1,124.0 ) (595.4 ) Net                 cash used in financing (955.5 ) (150.7 ) (900.6 ) Effect                 of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 9.0 3.8 2.0 Net                 increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (240.6 ) 280.4 447.5 Cash                 and cash equivalents at beginning of year 1,290.7 1,010.3 562.8 Cash                 and cash equivalents at                 end of year $ 1,050.1 $ 1,290.7 $ 1,010.3 37 Historically,       the majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents have been provided from       operating activities and this trend continued during fiscal 2007 as operating       activities generated an additional $27 million in cash compared to the prior       year or $1.6 billion in net cash during fiscal 2007.Cash generated       from operations during fiscal 2007 was the result of factors with significant,       but opposing, impacts on cash flow, including cash outflows to fund the       restructuring plan and cash inflows from advanced customer       payments.Factors impacting working capital during the year       include:  During                 fiscal 2007 cash payments for restructuring activities were $181                 million;                 net of $26 million from the sale of assets related to the restructuring,                 during fiscal 2007  During                 fiscal 2007 the Companys billed trade accounts receivables and unbilled                 receivables increased approximately $223 million and $229 million,                 respectively. The increase in trade receivables was across both the                 North                 American Public Sector and the Global Commercial segments.The                 increase in unbilled receivables related primarily to contracts in                 Europe                 and U.S. federal contracts.This compares to an increase in                 unbilled receivables of approximately $184 million and a minimal                 increase                 in trade accounts receivable during fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2007                 increase                 in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables contributed                 to an                 increase in DSO to 94 days at the end of fiscal 2007 from 87 days                 at the                 end of last year.
The                 Companys investment in deferred costs and work in progress related to                 certain contracts increased approximately $231 million during fiscal                 2007                 compared to an increase of $262 million in the prior year.The                 majority of the increase relates to the UK National Health Service                 contract.
Accounts                 payable and accrued expenses combined increased $532 million for                 fiscal                 2007 compared to a decrease of $50 million for fiscal 2006. The increase                 in the balance for fiscal 2007 was the result of the timing of payments                 for accounts payable, which included an increase of approximately                 $110                 million of capital expenditure payables, an increase in accrued expenses                 for restructuring activities and activity on                 contracts.
The                 Company made payments for taxes of $304.8 million and $147.9 million                 for                 fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively.The Company projects cash                 payments for taxes to remain at fiscal 2007 levels for 2008; however,                 resolution of tax contingencies could have a significant impact on                 cash                 tax payments.
Advanced                 payments received from customers increased approximately $270 million                 during fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of the achievement of billing                 milestones on a significant development effort for a foreign government                 client.Such balances partially offset the Companys                 significant investment in this project.This compares to a                 decrease in advanced payments from customers for fiscal 2006 as a                 result                 of the winding down of a contract and lower advanced payments on                 another                 contract as it transitioned out of the start-up                 phase.
The       Company has submitted 16 Requests for Equitable Adjustment (REAs) totaling       in       excess of $1 billion on two U.S. Federal contracts. Included in current assets       on the Companys balance sheet is approximately $820 million of unbilled       accounts receivable and deferred costs related to the contracts. CSC has       requested payment for certain related out-of-scope work directed or caused       by       the customers in support of their critical missions. The contractual       modification process for scope changes has lagged behind the need for CSC to       provide critical on-going operational support. The Company does not record       any       profit element when it defers costs associated with such REAs. The Company       believes it has a legal basis for pursuing recovery of these REAs and that       collection is probable. Settlement of the amounts depends on individual       circumstances and negotiations with the parties and we are unable to predict       the       timing of resolution of the REAs.
38 The       Companys capital investments principally relate to purchases of computer       equipment and purchases and development of software, and deferred outsourcing       contract costs that have supported the Companys expanding Global Commercial       operations in prior years. Investments include computer equipment purchased       at       the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as for subsequent upgrades,       expansion or replacement of these client-supporting assets. For cash flow       presentation purposes, the Outsourcing Contracts line includes amounts paid       to       clients for assets purchased from the clients that are categorized as property       and equipment on the balance sheet. Outsourcing contract costs are also       comprised of incremental external costs as well as certain internal costs that       directly relate to a contracts acquisition or start-up, including payments to       clients for amounts in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets       (premium). The absence of significant new outsourcing contract awards during       the       latter part of fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 resulted in a reduction in investing       cash outflows for computer equipment and related facilities costs and for       outsourcing contract costs.These reductions in cash outflows were       partially offset by cash outflows for the acquisition of an identity management       and credentialing business (see Note 4 in Notes to Consolidated Financial       Statements) and an increase in cash outflows for purchase and development of       software as a result of software purchases in Europe, primarily for the National       Health Service contract.
While       increasing new business will typically require higher overall capital       investments, the mix of the new business will also impact the level of capital.       The growth in U.S. federal awards during fiscal 2006 limited the growth in       overall capital investment in fiscal 2007 as U.S. federal contracts typically       require lower levels of initial investment when compared with similar commercial       outsourcing contracts. This is expected to continue during fiscal 2008 but       is       expected to be tempered somewhat by revenue resulting from an increase in       commercial contract awards during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, as well       as       the payment for capital expenditures incurred during fiscal 2007 of       approximately $110 million.
Dispositions       of investments in businesses have from time to time generated investing cash       flows for the Company. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the       disposition of DynCorp International generated $775 million in cash proceeds.       As       discussed below the Company used these proceeds to reduce debt levels during       that quarter.
As       described above, historically a majority of the Companys capital investments       have been funded by cash from operations. Fiscal 2007 continued to reflect       this       trend; however, the Company has increased its use of capital leases to finance       certain equipment purchases related to long term contracts with total capital       lease obligations of $152 million as of March 30, 2007. The Company funded       the       acquisition and retirement of outstanding shares from two accelerated share       repurchase transactions during fiscal 2007 with approximately $600 million       of       commercial paper and cash on hand.The commercial paper was redeemed       during fiscal 2007 using cash generated from operating       activities.During fiscal 2006 the Company financed its capital       investments primarily with cash generated from operations. Financing cash       flows for fiscal 2005 reflected the Companys use of the proceeds from the sale       of DynCorp International to redeem $1.0 billion of term debt during the fourth       quarter of fiscal 2005. Cash outflows to redeem the term debt included $27.8       million of early redemption premiums. At year-end fiscal 2007 and 2006,       there was no outstanding commercial paper, a result of cash generated from       operations.
Partially       offsetting the financing cash out flows were cash proceeds from the exercise       of       employee stock options during fiscal 2007 and 2006 of $94.8 million and $101.1       million, respectively.
Liquidity       and Capital Resources The       balance of cash and cash equivalents was $1,050.1 million at March 30, 2007,       $1,290.7 million at March 31, 2006, and $1,010.3 million at April 1, 2005.       During fiscal 2007, equity decreased $619.9 million primarily as a result of       the       Companys repurchase of outstanding shares through two accelerated share       repurchase transactions and the adoption SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting       for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS No. 158),       which required the recognition of an additional unfunded pension obligation       of       $705.1million ($476.5million net of taxes) on the balance       sheet.The Companys total unfunded pension obligation was $801.7       million at March 30, 2007.In prior years, the unfunded pension       obligation would have been disclosed in the notes to the financial       statements.Current year earnings of $388.8 million, the exercise of       employee stock options for $94.8 million and an increase in the foreign currency       translation adjustment of $248.3 million partially offset these       reductions.
39 At       the       end of fiscal 2007, CSCs ratio of debt to total capitalization was 20.4%, up       from the ratio at the end of fiscal 2006 of 18.4%, and from 18.0% at the end       of       fiscal 2005. The increase in the debt ratio was primarily the result of the       decrease in equity due to the share repurchases and the impact of the adoption       of SFAS No. 158 as discussed above. The Companys debt to total       capitalization ratio of 20.4% is expected to rise in fiscal 2008 as a result       of       financing the announced acquisition of Covansys Corporation as well as financing       the repurchase of up to $1 billion of outstanding common stock under a Rule       10b5-1 purchase plan.The capitalization ratio may also be impacted       during fiscal 2008 by the need to finance other suitable investments the Company       may identify or other significant capital requirements that may       arise.

The       Companys sources of liquidity include cash, commercial paper and committed and       uncommitted lines of credit. Short-term borrowings are principally used to       supplement operating cash flow in funding working capital       requirements.
At       March       30, 2007, the Company had a committed line of credit providing $1 billion of       long-term commercial paper backup which expires on August 23, 2011. If the       Company were unable to sell its commercial paper, borrow under its uncommitted       lines of credit, or determines it is too costly to do either of the       aforementioned, the Company has the ability to borrow under this committed       line       of credit. This line of credit has the option of being drawn at a Base Rate,       a       Eurodollar Rate or a bid option rate. The line requires the Company to 1) limit       liens placed on our assets to $100 million and to liens incurred in the ordinary       course of business; 2) maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of       consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization       (EBITDA) to consolidated interest expense for the period of four consecutive       fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such period not to exceed       3.00       to 1.00; and 3) not permit at the end of any quarterly financial reporting       period the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA for the       period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to       such date, to exceed 3.00 to 1.00. For further details on this agreement please       see Exhibit 10.23, which is incorporated by reference to this Annual Report.       As       of March 30, 2007 the Companys total liquidity was approximately $2,050 million       which included cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1,050.1       million and availability under the syndicated backstop credit facility of $1       billion. As of March 30, 2007, the Company had no borrowings under this credit       facility and was in compliance with all terms of the agreement.
At       March       30, 2007, the Company had $51.9 million of short-term borrowings and $1.45       billion of long-term debt. As further described in Note 10 to the consolidated       financial statements, commercial paper is classified as short-term borrowings.       The Company had no outstanding commercial paper as of March 30,       2007.
In       March       2005, the Company used the proceeds from the sale of DynCorp International       and       cash on hand to redeem the 7.5% term notes due August 2005, and the 6.75% term       notes due June 2006 for $998.9 million, and an early redemption premium of       $27.8       million.
40 On       March       21, 2005, the Company instituted a voluntary share repurchase program for       shareholders owning less than 100 shares. Under this program which has now       expired, the Company repurchased 48,443 shares for $2.2 million on April 25,       2005 and 11,000 shares for $.5 million on May 31, 2005.
In       the       opinion of management, CSC will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs       for       the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating       activities, cash balances, and unused short-term borrowing capacity. If these       resources need to be augmented, major additional cash requirements would likely       be financed by the issuance of debt and/or equity securities and/or the exercise       of the put option as described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial       statements. During fiscal 2002, the Company filed a shelf registration statement       for up to $1.5 billion of debt and/or equity securities. The Company has       previously issued $600 million worth of term debt from the shelf registration,       leaving $900 million of shelf available for additional securities.As       a result of the delay in filing its second and third quarter Form 10-Qs during       fiscal 2007 the Company will not be able to utilize the available shelf       registration to issue additional securities until April of       2008.There can be no assurances the Company will be able to issue       debt with acceptable terms.

The       following table summarizes the Companys payments on contractual obligations by       period as of March30,2007: Dollars                 in millions Less                 than 1                 year 1-3                 years 3-5                 years More                 than 5                 years Total Long-term                 debt $ 499.4 $ 498.5 $ 297.8 $ 1,295.7 Interest                 on fixed rate debt $ 74.9 117.1 76.1 13.7 281.8 Capital                 lease obligations 41.5 36.5 16.7 57.1 151.8 Bank                 debt 51.9 51.9 Operating                 leases 302.1 397.8 199.9 125.6 1,025.4 Minimum                 purchase obligations 435.3 313.4 53.8 802.5 Other                 long-term liabilities .3 3.4 2.7 .1 6.5 Total $ 906.0 $ 1,367.6 $ 847.7 $ 494.3 $ 3,615.6 Regarding       minimum purchase obligations included above, the Company has signed long-term       purchase agreements with certain software, hardware, telecommunication and       other       service providers to obtain favorable pricing, committed service levels and       terms for services necessary for the operation of business activities. The       Company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over       remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years. If the Company       does       not meet the specified service minimums, the Company may have an obligation       to       pay the service provider a portion or all of the shortfall.
41 The       above       excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as       set       forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The Company has       numerous plans, both inside and outside of the U.S., and determines expected       funding requirements on a per-plan basis. The minimum funding requirement can       vary significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors, and can       be       zero in some years. Funding is determined based on a review of benefit       obligations and plan assets as well as various regulatory requirements including       ERISA and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) applied to U.S. government contracts.       While there are certain minimum contribution requirements, CSC may elect to       increase the level of funding of contributions based on a number of factors       including performance of pension investments, changes in workforce composition       and the ability to recover costs on cost reimbursable contracts. During fiscal       2008, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately $240 million       to       pension and postretirement benefit plans. The Company has not quantified       expected contributions beyond fiscal 2008 because it is not possible to predict       future timing or direction of the capital markets, which can have a significant       impact on future minimum funding obligations. Refer to the Critical Accounting       Estimates section later in this MD&A and to Note 12 to the notes to       consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Fiscal       2007 Company contributions amounted to $248.8 million. These fiscal year       contribution figures may differ from those in Note 12 to the notes to       consolidated financial statements due to the use of a December 31 st measurement       date       in that note.
Dividends       and Redemption It       has       been the Companys policy to invest earnings in the growth of the Company rather       than distribute earnings as dividends. This policy, under which dividends have       not been paid since fiscal 1969, is expected to continue, but is subject to       review by the Board of Directors.
CRITICAL       ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our       consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with       accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).       Our       significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated       financial statements under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The       preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP       requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts       of       assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as the disclosure of       contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on       historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the       circumstances. Many of the types of estimates made are for contract-specific       issues.Changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract       could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial       statements.
We       have       identified several critical accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is       considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions       is       material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the       impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect       on the consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting estimates       relate to: revenue recognition and cost estimation and recoverability on       long-term, fixed-price contracts; revenue recognition on software license sales       that require significant customization; capitalization of outsourcing contract       costs and software development costs; estimates used to determine deferred       income taxes; assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill;       assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities; and       assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation. For       all       of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as       forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
42 Revenue       recognition The       majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria and does       not       require significant estimates. Revenue from our fixed unit price contracts,       time       and materials contracts and cost plus contracts is recognized based on objective       criteria and is not subject to estimates that may change over time. However,       for       our fixed-price contracts that use percentage-of-completion accounting, which       is       less than seven percent of the Companys revenues, the determination of revenues       and costs requires significant judgment and estimation. Under this method we       recognize revenue on a constant margin as contract milestones or other output       based measures are achieved. Costs are deferred until contractual milestones       or       other output based or cost based measures are achieved. The method requires       estimates of costs and profits over the entire term of the contract, including       estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance. Such       estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state-of-the-art       technologies such as system development projects. The cost estimation process       is       based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our software and systems       engineers, program managers and financial professionals. Key factors that are       considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract       profitability include the availability and productivity of labor and the nature       and complexity of the work to be performed. A significant change in an estimate       on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of       operations. Our management regularly reviews project profitability and the       underlying estimates.
Modifications       to contract scope, schedule, and price may be required on development contracts       accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis. Accounting for such changes       prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics       and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of       recovery. If recovery is deemed probable, we may, as appropriate, either defer       the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize       the       costs and related revenue as current period contract performance. We routinely       negotiate such contract modifications in both the U.S. Federal and Global       Commercial segments.
Many       of       our contracts call for us to provide a range of services or elements to our       customers. The total estimated revenue for these contracts is allocated to       the       various services or elements based on relative fair value. These relative fair       values are determined based on objective evidence of fair value. Once the total       estimated revenue has been allocated to the various contract elements, revenue       for each element is recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method       for the services performed or elements delivered.
Estimates       of total revenue at contract inception often differ materially from actual       revenue due to volume difference, changes in technology or other factors which       may not be foreseen at inception.
Revenue       recognition on software license sales that require significant       customization If       significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software       product, revenue is recognized as the software customization services are       performed in accordance with the percentage-of-completion method described       above. Thus, cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the       project, and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on       results.
Capitalization       of outsourcing contract costs Certain       costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and       amortized over the contract life. These costs consist of contract acquisition       and transition/set-up costs, and include the cost of due diligence activities       after competitive selection, costs associated with installation of systems       and       processes, and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of       acquired assets (premiums). Finance staff, working with program management,       review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with       relevant accounting guidance.
43 Key       estimates and assumptions that we must make include assessing the fair value       of       acquired assets in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash       flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs. We utilize the       experience and knowledge of our professional staff in program management,       operations, procurement and finance areas, as well as third parties on occasion,       to determine fair values of assets acquired. To assess recoverability,       undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its       remaining life and compared to the unamortized deferred cost balance. Such       estimates require judgment and assumptions, which are based upon the       professional knowledge and experience of our personnel. Key factors that are       considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor       costs and productivity efficiencies. A significant change in an estimate or       assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results       of operations. Amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction to       revenues.
Capitalization       of software development costs We       capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and       to       develop or purchase internal-use software. Significant estimates and assumptions       include: determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the       capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives, estimating the       marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues,       and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. For commercial       software products, determining the appropriate amortization period is based       on       estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. We consider various       factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment       of       alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the       product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product       obsolete. For internal-use software, the appropriate amortization period is       based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis.       To assess the realizability or recoverability of capitalized software costs,       we       must estimate future revenue, costs and cash flows. Such estimates require       assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows, and are based on the       experience and knowledge of professional staff. A significant change in an       estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material       change to our results of operations.
Estimates       used to determine income tax expense We       make       certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial       statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation       of       certain tax assets and liabilities, which principally arise from differences       in       the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement       purposes. We also must analyze income tax reserves, as well as determine the       likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and adjust any valuation       allowances accordingly. Considerations with respect to the recoverability of       deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned       use of the tax asset, and historical and projected taxable income as well as       tax       liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Valuation       allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each       future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these       factors.
Assumptions       related to purchase accounting and goodwill We       account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. This       method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities       acquired, including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such       as customer-related intangibles, as well as assessments of the fair value of       existing assets such as property and equipment. Liabilities acquired can include       balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to       or       at the time of acquisition, and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable       value. Third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of       certain assets and liabilities, but even those determinations would be based       on       significant estimates provided by us, such as forecasted revenues or profits       on       contract-related intangibles. Numerous factors are typically considered in       the       purchase accounting assessments, which are conducted by Company professionals       from legal, finance, human resources, information systems, program management       and other disciplines. Changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired       assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values, resulting       in       an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business       acquired.
44 As       goodwill is not amortized, goodwill balances are regularly assessed for       potential impairment. Such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow       projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to       calculate present values. Cash flow projections are based on management-approved       estimates, which involve the input of numerous Company professionals from       finance, operations and program management. Key factors used in estimating       future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on       existing contracts, estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs, and       assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates. Significant       changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and       goodwill impairment testing can have a material effect on the consolidated       financial statements.
Assumptions       to determine retirement benefits costs and       liabilities We       offer       a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans.       CSC utilizes actuarial methods required by Statement of Financial Accounting       Standards (SFAS) No. 87, as amended by SFAS No. 158 for fiscal 2007, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for       Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, to account for pension and       postretirement benefit plans, respectively. The actuarial methods require       numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense       and       the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans.       Two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long-term rate of       return on plan assets and discount rates. In making these assumptions, we are       required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest       rates. Changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future       due to changes in these and other assumptions.
The       expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate       the actual long-term returns on pension plan assets. The assumption for the       expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into       account the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for each       plan,       the asset mix of the plan, historic plan asset returns as well as current market       conditions and other factors. The weighted-average of the expected long-term       rates of return, for all plans, on plan assets utilized for the fiscal 2007       pension plan valuations was 7.7% compared to 7.8% used in fiscal 2006. Holding       all other assumptions constant, a one-half percent increase or decrease in       each       of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased,       respectively, the net periodic pension cost by approximately $16       million.
An       assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial       valuation. The discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for       high-quality, fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration       of       the benefit payments for each of our pension plans as of the annual measurement       date and is subject to change each year. The weighted-average of the discount       rates utilized for the fiscal 2007 pension plan valuations was 5.3% compared       to       5.6% used for fiscal 2006. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one-half       percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have       decreased the net periodic pension cost by approximately $40 million, or       increased it by approximately $52 million, respectively. Some portion of the       increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable       contracts.
The       accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility       in       earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of       plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements       in       the periods in which such changes occur. For example, while the expected       long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the       actual long-term returns, differences between the expected and actual returns       may occur in any given year. Such differences contribute to the deferred       actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time. For CSC, positive       market returns for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 caused actual pension plan asset       returns to exceed those expected. Declining discount rates over the past several       years, which resulted in higher calculated benefit obligations, served to       partially offset or more than offset the positive impact of the asset returns       for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, respectively.
For       fiscal 2007, SFAS No. 158 requires recognition of a pension obligation if the       fair value of plan assets is less than the projected benefit obligation (PBO)       at       the end of the year.For fiscal 2006, SFAS No. 87 requires       recognition of a minimum pension obligation if the fair value of plan assets       is       less than the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) at the end of the       year.At the end of fiscal 2007, a number of our pension plans had       PBOs in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets, thus requiring       the recognition of additional pension obligations.The effect of this       adjustment and the annual measurement was to increase pension liability by       $403.5 million, decrease intangible assets by $16 million, decrease non-current       asset by $87.4 million, and increase accumulated comprehensive loss by $539.7       million ($376.0 million net of taxes).Based on future plan asset       performance and interest rates, additional charges to equity might be       required.
45 Assumptions       and estimates used to analyze contingencies and       litigation We       are       subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits, insurance,       tax and other issues arising out of the normal course of business. The       consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and       contingencies based on managements view of the expected outcome. CSC consults       with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other       experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.       If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable,       we accrue a liability in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for       Contingencies. Significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in       assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect       on       the consolidated financial results.
46 Item       7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest       Rates The       Company utilizes fixed-rate long-term debt obligations, short-term commercial       paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest       rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of       changes in interest rates on the value of market-risk sensitive financial       instruments. A hypothetical 10% movement in interest rates would not have a       material impact on the Companys future earnings or cash flows and fair value of       fixed rate debt.
Foreign       Currency During       the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into certain contracts       denominated in foreign currency. Potential foreign currency exposures arising       from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process. The       Company generally manages these transactions by incurring costs to service       contracts in the same currency in which revenue is received. Short-term contract       financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency. By generally       matching revenues, costs and borrowings to the same currency, the Company has       been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings. However,       the Company is increasing its use of offshore support and is therefore becoming       more exposed to currency fluctuations.The Company may use foreign       currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these       transactions.
During       fiscal 2007, 38.2% of the Companys revenue was generated outside of the United       States. Using sensitivity analysis, a hypothetical 10% increase in the value       of       the U.S. dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by 3.82% or $567.9       million, while a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar       against all currencies would increase revenue by 3.82% or $567.9 million. In       the       opinion of management, a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset       by expenses incurred in local currency. As a result, a hypothetical 10% movement       of the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies in either direction       would       impact the Companys earnings before interest and taxes by $8.3 million. This       amount would be offset, in part, from the impacts of local income taxes and       local currency interest expense.
At       March       30, 2007, the Company had approximately $914.1 million of non-U.S. dollar       denominated cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $51.9 million of       non-U.S. dollar borrowings.

48 MANAGEMENT       REPORT Management       Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The       management of Computer Sciences Corporation (the Company) is responsible for       establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.       The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to       provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting       and the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements for       external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally       accepted in the United States of America.
The       Companys internal control over financial reporting includes policies and       procedures pertaining to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,       accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide       reasonable assurance transactions are recorded as necessary to permit       preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting       principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and receipts       and       expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management       and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding       prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition       of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the Companys       consolidated financial statements. All internal controls, no matter how well       designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even where internal control       over       financial reporting is determined to be effective, it can provide only       reasonable assurance. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future       periods are subject to the risk controls may become inadequate because of       changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or       procedures may deteriorate.
As       of the       end of the Companys 2007 fiscal year, management conducted an assessment of the       effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based       on the framework established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by       the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission       (COSO).A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or a       combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote       likelihood that a material misstatement to the Companys annual or interim       financial statements will not be prevented or detected.In the course       of the Companys assessment, it has identified the following material weakness       in internal control over financial reporting: there are insufficient       knowledgeable and competent personnel in certain key positions within the tax       function and processes and procedures over accounting for income taxes are       not       adequate for the Companys size and complexity.As a result of this       material weakness in internal control over the accounting for income taxes,       material errors in income tax expense and related liabilities and deferred       tax       assets occurred in fiscal 2007 and prior years which resulted in restatements,       as described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial       statements.Accordingly, management has determined the       Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March 30, 2007 was not       effective.
Managements       assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial       reporting as of March 30, 2007 has been audited by the Companys independent       registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page       50.
Date:       June 13, 2007 49 REPORT       OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To       the       Board of Directors and Stockholders Computer       Sciences Corporation El       Segundo, California We       have       audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report       on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Computer Sciences Corporation       (the Company) did not maintain effective internal control over financial       reporting as of March 30, 2007, because of the effect of the material weakness       identified in managements assessment based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of       Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.The Companys       management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over       financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal       control over financial reporting.Our responsibility is to express an       opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the       Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our       audit.
We       conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company       Accounting Oversight Board (United States).Those standards require       that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether       effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all       material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of       internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment,       testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal       control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in       the       circumstances.We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis       for our opinions.
A       companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or       under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal       financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by       the       companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide       reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the       preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with       generally accepted accounting principles.A companys internal       control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that       (1)       pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately       and       fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;       (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary       to       permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted       accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are       being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors       of       the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely       detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys       assets that could have a material effect on the financial       statements.
Because       of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,       including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of       controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented       or       detected on a timely basis.Also, projections of any evaluation of       the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future       periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because       of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies       or       procedures may deteriorate.
A       material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant       deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material       misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented       or detected.The following material weakness has been identified and       included in management's assessment: there are insufficient knowledgeable and       competent tax personnel and the Companys processes and procedures for       accounting for income taxes are inadequate for the Companys size and       complexity. As a result of this material weakness in the design of internal       control over accounting for income taxes, material errors in income tax expense       and related liabilities and deferred tax assets occurred in fiscal 2007 and       prior years.This deficiency results in a more than remote       likelihood that a material misstatement to the Companys income tax expense and       related liabilities and deferred tax asset accounts in the annual or interim       financial statements will not be prevented or detected. This material weakness       was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests       applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements and financial       statement schedule as of and for the year ended March 30, 2007 of the Company       and this report does not affect our report on such financial statements and       financial statement schedule.
50 In       our       opinion, managements assessment that the Company did not maintain effective       internal control over financial reporting as of March 30, 2007, is fairly       stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of       Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.Also in our       opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on       the       objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective       internal control over financial reporting as of March 30, 2007, based on the       criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued       by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway       Commission.
We       have       also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting       Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and       financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended March 30, 2007 of       the       Company and our report dated June 13, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion       on       those financial statements and financial statement schedule, and includes an       explanatory paragraph relating to the Companys adoption of Statement of       Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment on April 1, 2006 and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit       Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 87,       88, 106 and 132R on March 30, 2007.
DELOITTE       & TOUCHE LLP Los       Angeles, California June       13,       2007 51 REPORT       OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To       the       Board of Directors and Stockholders Computer       Sciences Corporation El       Segundo, California We       have       audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Computer Sciences       Corporation (the Company) as of March 30, 2007 and March 31, 2006, and the       related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows       for each of the three years in the period ended March 30, 2007.Our       audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at       Item 8.These financial statements and the financial statement       schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management.Our       responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and the       financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We       conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company       Accounting Oversight Board (United States).Those standards require       that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether       the financial statements are free of material misstatement.An audit       includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and       disclosures in the financial statements.An audit also includes       assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by       management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement       presentation.We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis       for our opinion.
In       our       opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material       respects, the financial position of Computer Sciences Corporation as of March       30, 2007 and March 31, 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash       flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 30, 2007, in       conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States       of       America.Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule,       when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements       taken       as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set       forth       therein.
As         discussed in Note 1, Note 12 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial         statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards         (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment on April 1, 2006 and SFAS No.         158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other         Postretirement Plans  An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 87, 88, 106 and         132R on March 30, 2007.
As         discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company         has restated the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31,         2006,         and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and         cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31,         2006.
We       have       also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting       Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Companys internal       control over financial reporting as of March 30, 2007, based on the criteria       established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the       Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report       dated June 13, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment       of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting       and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control       over financial reporting.

(See       notes to consolidated financial statements) 57 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles       of Consolidation The       accompanying consolidated financial statements include those of Computer       Sciences Corporation, its subsidiaries and those joint ventures and partnerships       over which it exercises control, hereafter collectively referred to as CSC or the Company.Investments in business entities in which the Company       does not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence       over operating and financial policies, generally 20  50 percent ownership, are       accounted for by the equity method. Other investments are accounted for by       the       cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances have been       eliminated.
Reclassification Prior       period amounts have been adjusted to conform to current year       presentation.
The       Company has reclassified pension plans which have asset balances from other       long-term liabilities to other assets.The reclassifications have       been made to prior the period consolidated balance sheet to conform to the       current year presentation.As a result the Companys March 31, 2006       balance sheet herein reflects an $86.3 reclassification of other long-term       liabilities to other assets.The balance sheet was the only financial       statement impacted by this reclassification.
Prior       year pension disclosure amounts have been restated to exclude a government       plan       which the Company has determined does not fall under SFAS No. 132(R) (as       modified by SFAS No. 158), as the Company is not the plan sponsor.
Accounting       Change The       Company adopted FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.       158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement       Plans  An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R, effective       March 30, 2007.This Statement requires recognition of the overfunded       or underfunded status of single-employer defined benefit postretirement plans       as       assets or liabilities, respectively, on the balance sheet.Changes to       the funded status of the defined benefit plans are recognized in comprehensive       income in the year in which the change occurs.Changes in the funded       status are measured based on the projected benefit obligation for pension plans       and the accumulated benefit obligation for other postretirement       plans.
SFAS       No.       158 further requires that the funded status of a defined benefit plan be       measured as of the Companys fiscal year end balance sheet date.This       provision is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15,       2008.The Company has not yet determined the impact of this change to       its financial statements.
The       provisions of SFAS No. 158 were applied prospectively as of March 30, 2007       with       the exception of the measurement date provision which will be applied in fiscal       2009.
58 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The       impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 on the Companys consolidated balance       sheet as of March 30, 2007 was as follows: Before                 Adoption of SFAS No. 158 Adjustments After                 Adoption of SFAS No. 158 Other                 assets $ 583.5 $ (146.5 ) $ 437.0 Total                 assets 13,877.0 (146.5 ) 13,730.5 Other                 accrued expense 1,783.3 16.0 1,799.3 Income                 taxes payable 981.5 (228.6 ) 752.9 Total                 current liabilities 5,472.2 (212.6 ) 5,259.6 Other                 long-term liabilities 630.6 542.6 1,173.2 Accumulated                 other comprehensive income 408.0 (476.5 ) (68.5 ) Total                 stockholders equity 6,362.0 (476.5 ) 5,885.5 Total                 liabilities and stockholders equity 13,877.0 (146.5 ) 13,730.5 On       April       1, 2006 the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based       Payment.The Company has adopted the modified prospective transition       method and therefore has not restated the results of prior       periods.Under this method, the Company is required to recognize       compensation expense equal to the fair value of partially vested share-based       awards at April 1, 2006 over the remaining period of service, as well as the       compensation expense for those share-based awards granted or modified on or       after April 1, 2006.The total stock-based compensation expense for       awards issued on or after April 1, 2006 is recorded on a straight-line basis       over the vesting period based on the grant-date fair values.For       those awards granted prior to the date of adoption, compensation expense is       recognized on an accelerated basis based on the grant-date fair value amount       as       calculated for pro forma purposes under SFAS No. 123.The fair values       are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model as discussed       further below.With respect to the income tax benefits associated       with exercises of share-based payments, the Company has elected to adopt the       alternative transition method as permitted by Financial Accounting Standards       Board Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 123(R)-3:Transition Election       Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment       Awards.
Prior       to       the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company accounted for its stock-based       compensation expense under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25       Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related       interpretations.The Company disclosed in its prior financial       statements certain pro forma net income and earnings per share information       under       SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No.       148 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and       Disclosure.
In       accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), the Company recognized $58.4 of stock-based       compensation expense ($41.2 net of tax) for fiscal 2007.Of this       amount, $13.8 was charged to costs of services and $44.6 was charged to selling,       general and administrative expense, respectively.As a result of       adopting SFAS No. 123(R), income from continuing operations before taxes for       fiscal 2007 was $48.4 ($34.2 net of tax) lower than had the Company continued       to       account for share-based compensation under APB 25.The impact on both       basic and diluted earnings per share for the same period was $.19 per       share.

The risk-free interest rate was based on the       zero coupon interest rate of U.S. Government issued Treasury strips with a       period commensurate with the expected term of the options.In       determining the overall risk-free interest rate, a range of interest rates       from       4.11% to 4.96% was applied depending on the expected life of the       grant.Expected volatility was based on a blended approach using an       equal weighting of implied volatility and historical       volatility.Historical volatility was based on the Companys 10-year       historical daily closing price.Implied volatility was based on       option trading behavior for those options traded on certain exchange markets       that have maturities of nine months and longer.The range of       volatility used for fiscal 2007 was 28% to 33%.Forfeitures were       estimated based on historical experience.
The       weighted average fair values of stock options granted during fiscal 2007, fiscal       2006 and fiscal 2005 were $16.67, $15.59 and $16.95 per share,       respectively.In calculating the actual and pro forma compensation       expense for its stock incentive plans, the Company used the following weighted       average assumptions: Fiscal                 Year 2007 2006 2005 Risk-free                 interest rate 4.84 % 3.73 % 3.47 % Expected                 volatility 28 % 41 % 47 % Expected                 lives 4.09                 years 3.87                 years 3.67                 years 60 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The       Company implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No.       (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations-an       interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 at December 31, 2005. The Companys       asset retirement obligation relates to leases which require the leased       facilities be restored to their original condition upon expiration of the lease.       As a result of adopting FIN 47, the Company recorded a liability for the asset       retirement obligation of approximately $8.5 and recorded a charge to a       cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for $5.6 ($4.3 after tax).       Pro forma effects of implementing FIN 47 were not disclosed as they were not       material.
Use       of Estimates The       preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting       principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires       management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported       in       the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results       could differ from those estimates.
Revenue       Recognition The       Companys primary service offerings are information technology (I/T) outsourcing       and I/T and other professional services. The Company provides these services       under time and materials, cost-reimbursable, unit-price and fixed price       contracts. The form of contract, rather than the type of service offering,       is       the primary determinant of revenue recognition. Except as described below for       certain fixed price contracts, revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence       of an arrangement exists, services or products have been provided to the client,       the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably       assured.
For       time       and materials contracts, revenue is recorded at agreed-upon billing rates at       the       time services are provided.
For       cost-reimbursable contracts, revenue is recorded at the time costs are incurred       and associated fees are recognized when probable and estimable by applying       an       estimated factor to costs as incurred, such factor being determined by the       contract provisions and prior experience.
Revenue       is recognized on unit-price contracts based on unit metrics times the agreed       upon contract unit price.
Revenue       on eligible fixed price contracts is recognized on the basis of the estimated       percentage-of-completion. Eligible contracts include certain software       development projects and fixed price arrangements with the U.S. Federal       government. Currently, less than seven percent of the Companys revenues are       recognized under this method. Progress towards completion is typically measured       based on achievement of specified contract milestones, or other measure of       progress when available, or based on costs incurred as a proportion of estimated       total costs. Profit in a given period is reported at the expected profit margin       to be achieved on the overall contract. This method can result in the       recognition of unbilled receivables or the deferral of costs or profit on these       contracts. Deferred costs may include costs related to customer change orders       subject to negotiation with the customer. These deferred costs are recorded       as       prepaid expenses on the Companys balance sheet. Management regularly reviews       project profitability and underlying estimates. Revisions to the estimates       at       completion are reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting       estimate in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become       known by management. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, are recognized       in       the period in which the loss becomes probable and estimable. The provision       includes estimated costs in excess of estimated revenue and any profit margin       previously recognized.
61 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The       sale       of proprietary software licenses typically includes multiple deliverables such       as a license to use the software, post contract customer support, and services.       Revenue is allocated to the undelivered elements equal to their fair value       with       the remainder allocated to the delivered software license element. Fair value       is       determined based on the price charged where each deliverable is sold separately.       Revenue allocated to each element is recognized when 1) a written contract       is       executed, 2) the element has been delivered, 3) the fee is fixed and       determinable, and 4) collectibility is reasonably assured. If significant       customization is required, software licensing revenue is recognized as the       related software customization services are performed in accordance with the       percentage-of-completion method, utilizing the output method to measure progress       to completion. Costs incurred in connection with sales of proprietary software       are expensed as incurred.
Client       contracts may include the provision of more than one of CSCs services. CSC       adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 00-21, Revenue Arrangements       with Multiple Deliverables, for all arrangements entered into or modified after       July 4, 2003.Accordingly, for applicable arrangements, revenue       recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting       and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values,       with proper consideration given to the guidance provided by other authoritative       literature.
Depreciation       and Amortization The       Companys depreciation and amortization policies are as follows: Property                 and Equipment: Buildings 10                 to 40 years Computers                 and related                 equipment 3                 to 5 years Furniture                 and other                 equipment 2                 to 10 years Leasehold                 improvements Shorter                 of lease term or useful life Software 2                 to 10 years Credit                 information files 10                 to 20 years Acquired                 contract related intangibles Contract                 life and first contract renewal Outsourcing                 contract costs Contract                 life, excluding option years For       financial reporting purposes, the cost of property and equipment, less       applicable residual values, is depreciated using predominately the straight-line       method. Depreciation commences when the specific asset is complete, installed       and ready for normal use. Outsourcing contract costs and credit information       files are amortized on a straight-line basis.Acquired intangible       assets are amortized based on estimated undiscounted cash flow over the       estimated life of the asset or on a straight line basis if cash flow cannot       be       reliably estimated.
Software       Development Costs The       Company capitalizes costs incurred to develop commercial software products       after       technological feasibility has been established. Costs incurred to establish       technological feasibility are charged to expense as incurred. Enhancements       to       software products are capitalized where such enhancements extend the life or       significantly expand the marketability of the products.Amortization       of capitalized software development costs is determined separately for each       software product.Annual amortization expense is calculated based on       the greater of (a) the ratio of current gross revenues for each product to       the       total of current anticipated future gross revenues for the product or (b) the       straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the       product.
Unamortized       capitalized software costs associated with commercial software products are       regularly evaluated for impairment on a product-by-product basis by a comparison       of the unamortized balance to the products net realizable value. The net       realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from that product       reduced by the related estimated future costs. When indications exist of a       possible impairment in software, the Company assesses recoverability by       reviewing undiscounted estimated cash flows associated with the software product       or its related asset group and compares the total to the unamortized       balance.
62 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The       Company capitalizes costs incurred to develop internal-use computer software.       Internal and external costs incurred in connection with development of upgrades       or enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized.       These capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the       estimated useful life of the software. Purchased software is capitalized and       amortized over the estimated useful life of the software.
Outsourcing       Contract Costs Costs       on       outsourcing contracts, including costs incurred for bid and proposal activities,       are generally expensed as incurred. However, certain costs incurred upon       initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and expensed over the       contract life. These costs represent incremental external costs or certain       specific internal costs that are directly related to the contract acquisition       or       transition activities. Such capitalized costs can be separated into two       principal categories: contract acquisition costs and transition/set-up costs.       The primary types of costs that may be capitalized include labor and related       fringe benefits, subcontractor costs, travel costs, and asset       premiums.
The       first       principal category, contract acquisition costs, consists mainly of due diligence       activities after competitive selection as well as premiums paid. Premiums are       amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets.       Fixed assets acquired in connection with outsourcing transactions are       capitalized at fair value and depreciated consistent with fixed asset policies       described above. Premiums are capitalized as outsourcing contract costs and       amortized over the contract life. The amortization of outsourcing contract       cost       premiums is accounted for as a reduction in revenue. The second principal       category of capitalized outsourcing costs is transition/set-up costs. Such       costs       are primarily associated with installation of systems and       processes.
In       the       event indications exist that an outsourcing contract cost balance related to       a       particular contract may be impaired, undiscounted estimated cash flows of the       contract are projected over its remaining term, and compared to the unamortized       outsourcing contract cost balance. If the projected cash flows are not adequate       to recover the unamortized cost balance, the balance would be adjusted to equal       the contracts fair value in the period such a determination is made. The       primary indicator used to determine when impairment testing should be performed       is when a contract is materially underperforming, or is expected to materially       underperform in the future, as compared to the original bid model or subsequent       annual budgets.
Terminations       of outsourcing contracts, including transfers either back to the client or       to       another I/T provider, prior to the end of their committed contract terms are       infrequent due to the complex transition of personnel, assets, methodologies,       and processes involved with outsourcing transactions. In the event of an early       termination, the Company and the client, pursuant to certain contractual       provisions, engage in discussions to determine the recovery of unamortized       contract costs, lost profits, transfer of personnel, rights to implemented       systems and processes, as well as other matters.
Acquisition       Accounting and Goodwill Under       acquisition accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the underlying       tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon       their       respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Goodwill       is       assessed for impairment at least annually for each reporting unit. See Notes       4       and 5 for further discussion.
63 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Marketable       Securities The       Company classifies its investments in marketable securities in accordance with       SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity       Securities. Based on criteria set forth in SFAS No. 115 the Company has       determined all of its investment securities are to be classified as       available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value,       with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of       shareholders equity. During fiscal 2007 the Company recorded $2.3 ($1.7 after       taxes) of unrealized gains related to available-for-sale securities as of March       30, 2007. Available-for-sale securities are included in Prepaid expenses and       other current assets in the accompanying balance sheets. Realized gains and       losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on       available-for-sale securities are included in selling, general and       administrative expenses.
During       the first quarter of fiscal 2007 the Company redeemed the preferred stock       received from the sale of DynCorp International for $168.6, $23.8 representing       dividends receivable, resulting in a gain of $11.2 net of taxes of       $7.1.
Income       Taxes Accounting       for income taxes requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets       for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the       financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and       liabilities. The Company maintains valuation allowances where, based on the       weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not all or a portion of       a       deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from       period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change.       In       determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, the Company takes into       account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings,       carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially       enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. The Company       is       also subject to examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue       Service and other tax authorities. The Company periodically assesses the       likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine       the impact on deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of       the       provision for income taxes.
Cash       Flows For       purposes of reporting cash and cash equivalents, the Company considers all       investments in cash equivalents purchased with an original maturity of three       months or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys investments consist of high       quality securities issued by a number of institutions having high credit       ratings, thereby limiting the Companys exposure to concentrations of credit       risk. With respect to financial instruments, the Companys carrying amounts of       its other current assets and liabilities were deemed to approximate their market       values due to their short maturity. At March 30, 2007 and March 31, 2006, the       Company had no outstanding material hedge contracts with respect to its foreign       exchange or interest rate positions.
Capital       expenditures acquired through capital lease obligations were $77.2 for the       year       ended March 30, 2007 and capital expenditures in accounts payable were $123.3       for the year ended March 30, 2007.Previous year amounts were not       material.
Depreciation       and amortization reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows includes       amortization of outsourcing contract premiums of $88.3, $95.7 and $85.5 for       fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which is reported as a reduction       of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Cash       payments for interest on indebtedness and cash payments for taxes on income       are       as follows: Fiscal                 Year 2007 2006 2005 Interest $ 144.4 $ 95.1 $ 173.7 Taxes                 on income, net of refunds 304.8 147.9 49.3 64 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Valuation       of Long-Lived Assets The       Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used,       other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events       and       circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of a       long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash       flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying       value. In that case, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the       carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is       determined primarily using the expected present value, in which multiple cash       flow scenarios that reflect the range of possible outcomes and a risk free       rate       are used to estimate fair value. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed       of       are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for       the       cost of disposal. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in       a       write-down of the asset in a future period.
Foreign       Currency The       Company has determined local currencies are the functional currencies of the       foreign operations. Accordingly, these foreign entities translate assets and       liabilities from their local currencies to U.S. dollars using year-end exchange       rates while income and expense accounts are translated at the average rates       in       effect during the year. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as       part       of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). As of March 30, 2007 and       March       31, 2006 the balance of currency translation adjustment included in AOCI was       a       deferred gain of $431.0 and $182.7, respectively.

The number of such options was       5,214,576, 2,865,076 and 3,057,225 for the years ended March 30, 2007, March       31,       2006 and April 1, 2005, respectively.
Recent       Accounting Pronouncements In       June       2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in       Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). The       interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes       recognized in a company's financial statements in accordance with SFAS No.       109,       "Accounting for Income Taxes." Specifically, the pronouncement prescribes a       recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement       recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken       in a       tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on the related       derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for interim       periods, disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions. The       interpretation is effective for CSCs fiscal 2008. The Company is       assessing FIN 48 and has not determined the impact that the adoption of FIN       48       will have on its consolidated financial statements.The Company does,       however, expect to record a cumulative effect adjustment to its fiscal 2008       balance of beginning earnings retained for use in business, and that adjustment       may be material.
During       September, 2006 the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff Accounting       Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements       when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial       Statements.SAB No. 108 requires a registrant to quantify all       misstatements that could be material to financial statement users under both       the rollover and iron curtain approaches.If either approach results       in quantifying a misstatement that is material the registrant must adjust its       financial statements.SAB No. 108 is applicable for CSCs fiscal       2007.The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on       the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In       September 2006 the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value       Measurements.The Statement defines fair value, establishes a       framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted       accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value       measurements.This Statement applies under other accounting       pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.The       Statement does not require any new fair value measurements.The       Statement is effective for CSCs fiscal 2009.At this time the       Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material       impact on the Companys results of operations or financial       position.
In       February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for       Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB       Statement No. 115.This Statement permits entities to choose to       measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at       specified election dates.If the fair value option is elected, a       business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on elected items in       earnings at each subsequent reporting date.Upon initial adoption of       this Statement an entity is permitted to elect the fair value option for       available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities previously accounted for       under Statement 115.The effect of reclassifying those securities       into the trading category should be included in a cumulative-effect adjustment       of retained earnings and not in current-period earnings and should be separately       disclosed.This Statement is effective for CSCs fiscal       2009.The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will       have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial       position.
67 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       2Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements The       Company has restated the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March       31,       2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity       and cash flows for fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and April 1,       2005.These restatements relate to 1) the completion of the Companys       investigation of its stock option granting practices, 2) the correction of       errors relating to the accounting for income taxes, and 3) the recognition       of       revenue for the sale of licenses for a software product.The effects       of the restatement adjustments on the Companys originally reported results of       operations for the years ended March 31, 2006 and April 1, 2005 and on its       originally reported earnings retained for use in business at April 2, 2004       are       summarized below: Net                 Income for the Year                 Ended March                 31, 2006 Net                 Income for the Year                 Ended April                 1, 2005 Earnings                 Retained For                 Use In Business As Of April                 3, 2004 As                 previously reported $ 634.0 $ 810.2 $ 3,597.9 Adjustments: Revenue                 from software licensing arrangements,                 net of related income tax                 effect 14.1 12.9 (51.1 ) Stock-based                 compensation, net of related                 income tax effect (12.2 ) (6.2 ) (24.8 ) Stock                 based compensation in lieu of cash                 bonus, net of related income tax effect (1.0 ) .5 (2.6 ) Reversal                 of tax benefit associated with exercise                 of stock options (2.0 ) (1.6 ) (10.2 ) Penalties                 for income tax errors (4.0 ) (44.3 ) (7.4 ) Interest                 on income tax items, net of related tax                 effects (10.1 ) (1.6 ) (4.8 ) Income                 taxes (90.8 ) (11.2 ) (92.9 ) Other .1 (.6 ) 2.5 Net                 decrease (105.9 ) (52.1 ) (191.3 ) As                 restated $ 528.1 $ 758.1 $ 3,406.6 68 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       2Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements       (Continued) Revenue       Recognition The       Company determined that it did not correctly apply the provisions of Statement       of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition with respect to the sale of       licenses for a software product. As a result, the Company overstated       revenue and unbilled receivables and understated deferred revenue related to       this product in fiscal years prior to 2005.In fiscal years 2006 and       2005 this error resulted in an understatement of revenue.The Company       has restated revenue for fiscal 2006 and 2005 and as a result revenue increased       $23.4 and $21.4 for these years, respectively.The Company has also       restated receivables, other assets, and deferred revenue at March 31, 2006       resulting in increases (decreases) of $(13.7), $(20.7), and $5.2,       respectively.The cumulative effect of this error on earnings       retained for use in business was a decrease of $51.1 at April 3,       2004.
Income       Taxes The       Company identified errors related to income taxes in prior periods. The       most significant of these errors related to income tax accounting for       amortization of tax bases of assets contributed to a consolidated       affiliate.The impact of the correction of this error was an increase in       income tax expense of $53.7 and $11.8 for fiscal 2006 and 2005.The       cumulative effect of the correction of this error on earnings retained for       use       in business was a decrease of $91.4 at April 3, 2004.
In       addition, the Company identified errors in the accounting for U.S. income tax       liabilities related to foreign operations.The impact of the       correction of this error was an increase in income tax expense of $6.6 and       $5.4       for fiscal 2006 and 2005.The cumulative effect of this error on       earnings retained for use in business was a decrease $15.2 at April 3,       2004.
The       Company also identified individually immaterial income tax accounting errors       that have been corrected.These errors related principally to state       income taxes, provision for a gain, the valuation of state net operating losses       and deferred tax liabilities related to state taxes.The combined       impact of these errors on income tax expense was an increase of $28.4 and $1.4       for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively.The cumulative effect of the       correction of these errors on earnings retained for use in business was a       decrease of $3.6 at April 3, 2004.
Additionally,       the Company identified certain errors in the preparation ofU.S. federal       tax returns.These included an error which understated the deduction       of certain general and administrative costs in its U.S. federal income tax       returns for fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2005 and resulted in the overstatement       of       income tax expense by $7.4 for fiscal 2005 and an understatement of income       tax       expense by $2.1 for fiscal 2006.The cumulative effect of the       correction of these errors on earnings retained for use in business was an       increase of $17.3 at April 3, 2004.
As       a       result of the errors noted above the Company incurred interest and       penalties.For fiscal 2006 and 2005 the Company has recorded       adjustments related to additional interest expense of $16.7 and $2.6,       respectively, for the income tax errors.The cumulative effect on       earnings retained for use in business was a decrease of $4.8 at April 3,       2004.The Company also recorded penalties related to the income tax       errors of $4.0 and $44.3 for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively.The       cumulative effect of the penalties for periods prior to fiscal 2005 on earnings       retained for use in business was a decrease of $7.4 at April 3,       2004.

Other The       Company also identified errors in an accrual for payroll taxes and in recording       the tax benefit related to the exercise of employee stock       options.The correction of these errors increased (decreased) cost of       sales by $(0.1) and $1.1during fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, and       resulted in a $2.5 cumulative increase to earnings retained for use in business       at April 3, 2004.
The       Company has reclassified operating cash flow related to deferred taxes from       income taxes payable to deferred taxes on the cash flow statement as of March       31, 2006 to conform with current and prior period presentations.As a       result the Companys March 31, 2006 cash flow statement herein includes a $67.4       reclassification of income taxes payable to deferred taxes in addition to the       adjustments related to changes in deferred taxes as a result of the restatement       for tax accounting errors in the operating section of the Statement of Cash       Flows.The Statement of Cash Flows was the only financial statement       impacted by this reclassification.
Stock       Options In       July       2006 the Company established a special committee, comprised of the two most       recently elected independent directors (the Special Committee), to manage and       supervise an investigation into the Companys stock option grant practices       between March 1, 1996 and July 31, 2006 (the Relevant       Period).Together with its independent counsel and forensic       accountants, the Special Committee conducted an extensive review of stock option       grants made by the Company during the Relevant Period, which covered 13,564       grants.
Based       on       the results of the Special Committees investigation, the independent directors       determined that 9,234 stock option grants should be modified, principally due       to       delays in authorization and approval and the absence of definitive       documentation, including:  540                 stock option grants made between May 9, 1996, and June13,2002,                 which should have been accounted for as repricings of prior stock                 option                 grants, 527 of which require variable accounting until April 1, 2006,                 when                 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)                 No.                 123R, Share-Based Payment;  3,906                 other stock option grants made between April 9, 1996, and April 3,                 2006,                 for which the measurement date should be changed to a later date                 on which                 the closing stock price was higher, requiring additional compensation                 expense; and  4,788                 other stock option grants made between April 1, 1996, and July 10,                 2006,                 for which the measurement date should be changed to a later date                 on which                 the closing stock price was lower, requiring no additional compensation                 expense.
70 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       2Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements       (Continued) The       incremental cumulative non-cash compensation expense, before taxes, from       March1,1996, through March 31, 2006, related to stock options was as       follows: Fiscal                 Year Ended Pre-Tax                 Expense March                 29, 1996 $ 0.0 March                 28, 1997 $ 0.4 April                 3, 1998 $ 1.8 April                 2, 1999 $ 3.2 March                 31, 2000 $ 8.7 March                 30, 2001 $ 2.8 March                 29, 2002 $ 16.8 March                 28, 2003 $ (6.5 ) April                 2, 2004 $ 14.1 April                 1, 2005 $ 8.5 March                 31, 2006 $ 20.6 The       Company also determined that the tax benefits associated with the exercise       of       certain stock options in foreign jurisdictions had been incorrectly credited       against the foreign tax provision, rather than additional paid-in       capital.The Company further determined that it had inappropriately       applied the effective rate, rather than the U.S. statutory rate, in recognizing       the tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options in the       U.S.Correction of these two tax errors resulted in an incremental       cumulative tax provision of approximately $14.
Unless       otherwise indicated, all references in this Note 2 hereafter to years are to       calendar years.
Background During       the Relevant Period, CSC granted stock options to two categories of       employees:  the                 Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, each of their respective                 direct reports and each other employee who is an officer                 forpurposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934                 (collectively, Senior Executives);                 and  all                 other employees (collectively, Other                 Employees).
Option       grants to Senior Executives were approved by the Compensation Committee or       the       Board of Directors.Approvals for option grants to Other Employees       were delegated to the Chief Executive Officer or, after July 1999, in the case       of option grants of 5,000 shares or less, to the Corporate Vice President,       Human       Resources.The Company did not grant stock options to its independent       directors.
Option       grants during the Relevant Period can be grouped into three general       categories:  Annual                 Cycle Options, which were granted as part of the annual compensation                 review process each year;  Discounted                 Options, which, on and prior to May 12, 2004, were granted on the Annual                 Cycle Option grant date in lieu of a cash bonus, and which typically                 had                 an exercise price per share equal to 25% of the closing market price                 of                 the Companys common stock on the grant date;                 and  Other                 Options, which primarily include options granted to new hires (including                 to employees acquired through acquisitions and outsourcings) and                 for                 promotions and special recognition.

The       independent directors concluded that there was evidence that the Annual Cycle       Options granted to Senior Executives in 1996, 1999 and 2002 may each have had       two measurement dates: (i) the first occurring on the date of an initial action       to select the optionees, the number of option shares and the grant date closing       stock price to be used for the exercise price, and (ii) the second occurring       on       the date of a subsequent action, within 10 days, to select a later grant date       closing stock price to be used for the exercise price.Therefore, the       Company determined that the aggregate 54 Annual Cycle Option grants to Senior       Executives on May9,1996, May10,1999 and       June13,2002, should be accounted for as a repricing of options for       which a measurement date had previously been established on       May6,1996, May 3, 1999, and June 3, 2002,       respectively.Generally accepted accounting principles in effect at       the time require a change from fixed to variable accounting for the 1999 and       2002 repricings, but not for the 1996 repricing.The incremental       cumulative non-cash compensation expense before taxes from       March1,1996, through March 31, 2006, related to accounting for these       Annual Cycle Option grants to Senior Executives as repricings was approximately       $10.
Annual       Cycle Options Granted to Other Employees.
In       each       of the years from 1996 through 2005, there were changes, after the grant date,       in the list of Annual Cycle Options to be granted to Other       Employees.Therefore, the measurement date for all of the 7,562       Annual Cycle Options (excluding the 260 French grants discussed below) granted       to Other Employees in those years has been changed to be the first date upon       which the list was determined with finality.Of these grants, 3,891       had a lower closing stock price on the new measurement dates than on the related       grant dates, which did not result in any additional compensation       expense.The remaining 3,671 grants did, however, except as set forth       below, result in additional compensation expense amortized over the vesting       period.
The       new       measurement date for the 2001 Annual Cycle Options granted to Other Employees       resulted in a repricing requiring variable accounting.On October 29,       2001, the Company commenced an exchange offer (the 2001 Exchange Offer) pursuant       to which employees could elect to cancel unexercised options with an exercise       price per share of $70 or more in exchange for new options.The 2001       Exchange Offer was specifically designed so that no employee eligible to       participate was granted any options during the period beginning six months       before the commencement of the 2001 Exchange Offer and ending six months after       the option cancellation date.Although the grant date of the Annual       Cycle Options granted to Other Employees in 2001 precedes the 2001 Exchange       Offer commencement date by more than six months, the new measurement date of       these Annual Cycle Options does not.Consequently, certain of these       options were treated as a repricing of options held by the same optionee which       were cancelled in the 2001 Exchange Offer.The remaining 2001 Annual       Cycle Options which were not treated as a repricing also resulted in additional       compensation expense, since the new measurement date had a higher closing stock       price than the grant date.The restatement adjustment related to the       incremental cumulative non-cash compensation expense before taxes through March       31, 2006, related to changing the measurement date of the 2001 Annual Cycle       Options granted to Other Employees, and accounting for such options as a       repricing was approximately $21, including approximately $19 attributable to       variable accounting.
72 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       2  Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements       (continued) The       foregoing description excludes all Annual Cycle Options granted to Other       Employees subject to French taxes (French Options).The Company has a       French sub-plan pursuant to which it grants French Options addressing French       tax       consequences.One of the requirements for these options is that they       not be granted during a closed period, as defined under French tax       law.Until recently, the Company understood that the closed period       included, among other periods, the 10-trading day period before and after the       Company made a material announcement.Since the Company did not       determine the grant date of French Options until it had confirmed that no       material announcement was made during the following 10 trading days, the       measurement date for all of the 260 French Option grants made during the       Relevant Period has been changed.The Company currently believes that       the closed period does not include the 10-day period after a material       announcement (other than an earnings release or the filing of a Form 10-K or       Form10-Q).
The       restatement adjustment related to the incremental cumulative non-cash       compensation expense before taxes from March1,1996, through March       31, 2006, related to Annual Cycle Option grants to Other Employees, including       the $21 relating to the 2001 Annual Cycle Options discussed above, constitutes       approximately $47 of the total $70 incremental cumulative non-cash compensation       expense before taxes.
Discounted       Options and Restricted Stock The       Company has identified 105 Discounted Options granted between       May3,2000, and May 12, 2004, in which the identity of the optionee       or the number of shares underlying the option was not determined with finality       until after the grant date.The restatement adjustment related to the       incremental cumulative non-cash compensation expense before taxes from       May3,2000, through March 31, 2006, related to accounting for the       change in measurement dates for these Discounted Options grants was       approximately $1.
In       2005       and 2006, the Company granted restricted stock and restricted stock units,       respectively, in lieu of a cash bonus.Sixteen of the restricted       stock awards in 2005 were not determined with finality until after the grant       date, and the Company recorded an incremental cumulative non-cash compensation       expense before taxes from March 1, 1996, through June 30, 2006, related to       accounting for the change in measurement dates for these restricted stock awards       of less than $0.05.This amount has been included in the aggregate       incremental compensation expense amounts related to stock options.
The       Company has also determined it had incorrectly reversed accruals for certain       management bonuses which had been exchanged for discounted options and       awards.The aggregate incremental cumulative non-cash compensation       expense before taxes from March 1,1996, through June 30, 2006, related to       stock options includes the resulting increase or decrease in compensation       expense for each period affected.The cumulative impact of the bonus       accrual adjustments through March 31, 2006, was approximately $5.
Other       Options During       the Relevant Period, the Company issued 4,168 Other Option grants to new hires       and for promotions, special recognition and other reasons.Of these,       the Company identified 931 which were granted to new hires who joined the       Company through an acquisition or through an outsourcing by their former       employer, in which the measurement date should have been a date other than the       grant date.Although the acquisition or outsourcing agreement       generally set forth the aggregate number of option shares to be granted to       the       new employees, the specific allocation among employees was often not finalized       until after the grant date.
The       Company has also identified 320 additional Other Option grants in which the       measurement date should have been a date other than the grant date, and two       Other Option grants which should have been accounted for as repricings requiring       variable accounting.These Other Option grants were primarily made to       new hires or for promotions or special recognition.

STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       3Discontinued Operations The       Company exchanged its CSC Health Plan Solutions (HPS) business, which was       previously included in the Global Commercial segment, for approximately 7.13       million of CSC common shares held by a subsidiary of DST Systems Inc., which       shares were valued at $324.6 and included in treasury stock, on April 29, 2005.       The transaction was structured in accordance with Section 355 of the Internal       Revenue Code. The Company realized a gain of $22.9 on the transaction. The       revenue and expenses of HPS have been classified as discontinued operations       in       accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of       Long-lived Assets.
The       Company sold its equity interest in the international and other select       operations of DynCorp for $850 including $75 of 13% preferred stock of DynCorp       International (DI) on February 11, 2005. The transaction included the sale       of the stock of a wholly owned subsidiary which had a tax basis in excess of       its       carrying value for financial statement purposes. The tax benefit of this sale       reduced the tax associated with the transaction by $151.8. The Company realized       an initial after tax gain of approximately $228.8 on the transaction net of       taxes of $59.3. The gain was subject to working capital adjustments. During       fiscal 2006, the Company finalized the working capital adjustments, payable       in       preferred stock, for the sale of DI. As a result the Company recorded the       receipt of $65.5 of 13% preferred stock, issued as of February 11, 2005 and       an       additional gain on sale for DI of $38.4 net of taxes of $20.7. Also during       fiscal 2006, the Company recognized $20.2 of preferred stock dividend income       which is included in interest income in the consolidated statements of       income.

The acquisition       extends CSC's ability to offer comprehensive solutions in identity management       and credentialing, a market segment of strategic importance to CSC's North       American Public Sector operation. It also expands the company's capabilities       in       offering customer contact solutions to clients across the broad U.S. federal       market and strengthens CSCs ability to compete for work within the U.S.       Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies.
Datatracs       results of operations have been included with the Companys from the date of       acquisition, December 22, 2006, to the end of the period. The purchase price       of       the acquisition was allocated to the net assets acquired based on estimates       of       the fair values at the date of the acquisition.CSC allocated fair       values of $18.0 for certain intangible assets using an independent       appraisal.The $18.0 of intangible assets includes $16.9 for customer       contracts and related customer relationships with a weighted-average useful       life       of approximately 16 years and to be amortized based on the estimated timing       of       related cash flows, and the remainder is software licenses. The goodwill       recognized of $92.2 was assigned to the North American Public Sector, and is       expected to be deductible for tax purposes.In addition, the stock       purchase agreement contains an earn-out provision with additional consideration       based on the Companys success in winning the recompete for its Service Center       Operation Team (SCOT) contract with the U.S Federal Government.The       additional consideration may be up to $20 based on the terms of the       contract.
A       summary       of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Datatrac acquisition       and       the net cash paid are as follows: Estimated                 Fair Values Accounts                 receivable $ 25.3 Prepaids                 and other current assets 1.7 Other                 assets, net 0.5 Net                 property, plant and equipment 15.3 Accounts                 payable and accrued expenses (29.1 ) Long-term                 debt (.1 ) Goodwill 92.2 Intangible                 Asset 18.0 Net                 assets acquired and goodwill $ 123.8 Purchase                 price $ 126.0 Less                 cash acquired (2.2 ) Purchase                 price net of cash acquired $ 123.8 The       pro       forma impact on net income and earnings per share have not been disclosed for       the current or comparable prior periods, as the amounts were immaterial to       the       financial statements as a whole.

Restructuring In       April       2006, the Company announced a restructuring plan to be carried out during fiscal       2007 and 2008.The objectives of the plan are to 1) streamline CSCs       worldwide operations and 2) leverage the increased use of lower cost global       resources.Restructuring charges consist predominantly of severance       and related employee payments resulting from terminations.During the       third quarter of fiscal 2007 the Company evaluated facility consolidation       opportunities and other areas where operations can be streamlined and costs       reduced consistent with the plan objectives, resulting in additional lease       termination, asset impairment and other charges.
Workforce       reductions of approximately 4,400 employees occurred in fiscal 2007, and an       additional 1,100 reductions are planned for fiscal 2008. Termination-related       charges of $294.3 were recorded in fiscal 2007. Other, primarily vacant       space-related costs, of $39.1 were also recorded during the year, net of an       $11.6 gain on the sale of a data center facility. All but approximately $.1       million of the restructuring charge was incurred in the Global Commercial       reporting segment. Additional restructuring charges of not more than $110 are       expected to be incurred in fiscal 2008.
A       majority of the planned headcount reductions (3,000 in fiscal 2007 and 500       in       2008) were scheduled to take place in Europe.Approximately 1,100 and       500 positions were to be reduced in North America in fiscal 2007 and 2008,       respectively, with the balance in Australia and Asia. Partially offsetting       the       reductions were planned headcount increases in certain lower cost regions of       approximately 1,400 and 700 employees in fiscal 2007 and 2008,       respectively.As of March 30, 2007, approximately 4,400 separations       have been completed (approximately one-sixth due to attrition), with 3,000       in       Europe, 1,100 in North America and the remainder in Australia and       Asia.Approximately 2,100 new hires occurred in lower cost regions       during the year ended March 30, 2007, including replacements of some of the       4,400 reductions as well as for previously-planned and on-going business       activities.
The       Companys strategy in Europe has been to obtain negotiated, voluntary       terminations to the extent possible, but involuntary terminations were also       necessary in certain countries to attain targeted reductions. Outside of Europe,       terminations have been predominantly involuntary. Involuntary termination       benefits are determined in accordance with existing company policies and local       legal requirements. In some countries, local regulations require the Company       to       consult with employee representatives such as works councils or unions in the       determination of job categories and number of employees to be terminated, as       well as the resulting termination benefit amounts.
The       amounts of termination benefits are typically attributable to employees services already rendered and increase as length of service increases. The       Company records charges for negotiated, voluntary terminations at the time       an       employee accepts the Companys offer. Involuntary termination benefits are       accrued at the time such obligations are considered probable and reasonably       estimable. Such a calculation is based on estimates of benefit payouts as well       as number and type of staff to be terminated. In cases where a plan calls for       first attempting to garner voluntary terminations and then moves to involuntary       terminations if targeted reductions are not achieved, a charge is accrued based       on estimated involuntary benefits for all remaining reductions.
Accruals       for future termination benefits are based on a number of assumptions and       estimates. Such accruals may differ from actual results for a variety of       reasons, including: different benefit amounts or mix of employees as a result       of       completed employee representative consultations; additional voluntary       terminations in lieu of accrued involuntary terminations; changes in mix of       actual terminated employees by age, years of service, or job class.

Effective       February 28, 2006, Nortel Networks (Nortel) terminated the Companys services       for certain information technology outsourcing activities covered by the       agreement between Nortel and the Company.As a result the Company       recorded a non-cash special item charge of $77.3 ($48.3 after tax) or 26 cents       per share.The charge relates to the write down of outsourcing       contract costs and certain equipment associated with the Nortel contract to       estimated fair value, the loss on sale of equipment to Nortel, severance costs       and costs associated with terminating the contract.The Nortel       contract is included in the Global Commercial reporting segment.
During       fiscal 2005, the Company recorded special items of $28.6 ($18.4 after tax)       or 10       cents per share.Special items included $27.8 of early redemption       premiums and the write off of $1.7 of deferred debt issuance costs and       unamortized discount as described in Note 10.Special items also       included a $.9 reversal of special items recorded in fiscal 2001 in connection       with the consolidation of facilities.

Of       the       deferred tax amounts above, $390.0, and $398.5 are included in the current       income tax liability accounts at March 30, 2007 and March 31, 2006,       respectively. All long-term deferred tax assets are included in other assets       and       all long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term       liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
During       fiscal 2001 the Company made a net investment in an unconsolidated limited       partnership. The difference between the investments book and tax basis       generated a deferred tax asset in the amount of $151.0. The remaining deferred       tax asset at March 31, 2007 of $50.6 represents the expected reduction of the       Companys foreign income taxes payable or increases to loss carryforwards over       the next two years.
The       increase to the valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2007       of       $146.7 relates primarily to deferred tax assets for net operating losses in       certain foreign and state tax jurisdictions. In assessing the realizability       of       deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not       that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and       adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. In determining whether the deferred       taxes are realizable the Company considers the period of expiration of the       tax       asset, and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities       for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances       are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future       reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these       factors.
In       the       opinion of management the Company has adequately provided for income tax issues       not yet resolved with federal, state and foreign tax authorities. At March       30,       2007 and March 31, 2006, the Company has accrued $469.3 and $446.6,       respectively, for these matters.The Company records contingent tax       liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the       amount can be reasonably estimated at the date of the financial statements       related to positions taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities under       examination.These potential exposures result from differing       interpretations or applications of tax laws and regulations, and from certain       transactions, deductions or credits claimed on returns as       filed.Timing of the resolution of these matters is highly       uncertain.Although not probable, the most adverse resolution of       these issues could       result in additional charges to earnings in future periods. Based upon       consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, it is the opinion of       the       Companys management the resolution of these matters will not have a material       adverse impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of       operation.
88 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       8Income Taxes (Continued) At       March       30, 2007 and March 31, 2006, the Company has available unused foreign net       operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $1,349.9 and $736.6 and       state NOL carryforwards of approximately $794.9 and $1,302.1.As of       March 31, 2007, the foreign NOL carryforwards can be carried over indefinitely,       except for $279.2 which expire at various dates through 2014.As of       March 31, 2007, the state NOL carryforwards expire at various dates through       2027.
The       Company is currently the beneficiary of tax holiday incentives in India which       expire in fiscal years 2007 and 2009. As a result of the tax holiday incentives,       the Companys tax expense was reduced by approximately $7.2, $5.3 and $3.0       during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The       cumulative undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries were       approximately $958.8 as of March 30, 2007. As the Company intends to permanently       reinvest all such earnings, no provision has been made for income taxes that       may       become payable upon the distribution of such earnings, and it is not practicable       to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax       liability.
During       fiscal 2007, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commenced an examination of       the       Companys federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2000 through       2004.In addition, the Company filed a protest with respect to the       results of the IRS examination of fiscal years 1995 through 1999 with the Office       of Appeals.Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain,       in the opinion of management, the resolution of this audit is not expected       to       have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or       results of operations.
Note       9Receivables Receivables       consist of the following: March                 30, 2007 March                 31, 2006 As                 Restated (1) Billed                 trade accounts $ 2,330.0 $ 2,107.4 Unbilled                 recoverable amounts under contracts in progress 1,716.0 1,487.3 Other                 receivables 138.3 137.9 Total $ 4,184.3 $ 3,732.6 (1) See                 Note 2, "Restatement of Consolidated Financial                 Statements.
As       of       March 30, 2007, there were no billed trade accounts receivable for long-term       contracts that are unpaid by customers under retainage provisions.
Unbilled       recoverable amounts under contracts in progress generally become billable upon       completion of a specified contract, negotiation of contract modifications,       completion of government audit activities, achievement of project milestones       or       upon acceptance by the customer. Unbilled recoverable amounts under contracts       in       progress include amounts for long-term contracts of $955.4, including $427.6       which is expected to be collected during fiscal 2008 and $527.7 which is       expected to be collected within fiscal 2009 and thereafter.
89 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       10Debt Short-term The       Company has a commercial paper program. The program is backed by a multi-year       facility which expires on August 23, 2011. The Companys outstanding commercial       paper is classified as short term obligations.At March 30, 2007 and       March 31, 2006, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding. The weighted       average interest rate on the Companys commercial paper borrowings was 5.4% and       3.2% for the years ended March 30, 2007 and March 31, 2006,       respectively.
The       Company had $51.9 and $56.6 of borrowings outstanding under its uncommitted       lines of credit with certain foreign banks, as of March 30, 2007 and March       31,       2006, respectively. CSC has provided parent guarantees for these short-term       lines of credit which carry no commitment fees or significant covenants. The       weighted average interest rate on borrowings under these short-term lines of       credit was 3.7% at March 30, 2007 and 3.8% at March 31, 2006.
On       March       11, 2005, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 7.50% term notes due       August 2005 and all of its outstanding 6.75% term notes due June 2006. As the       result of these redemptions, the Company recorded a $29.5 pre-tax charge during       fiscal 2005 consisting of $27.8 of early redemption premiums and the write       off       of $1.7 of deferred issuance costs and unamortized discount. The debt redemption       charge is included in special items in the Consolidated Statements of       Income.
Long-term The       following is a summary of long-term debt: March                 30, 2007 March                 31, 2006 6.25%                 term notes, due March 2009 $ 200.0 $ 200.0 7.375%                 term notes, due June 2011 498.5 498.1 5.00%                 term notes, due February 2013 297.8 297.4 3.50%                 term notes, due April 2008 299.4 298.7 Capitalized                 lease liabilities 151.8 106.9 Notes                 payable 6.5 4.4 Total                 long-term debt 1,454.0 1,405.5 Less                 current maturities 41.8 28.7 Total $ 1,412.2 $ 1,376.8 Capitalized       lease liabilities shown above represent amounts due under leases for the use       of       computers and other equipment. Included in property and equipment are related       assets of $325.8 (2007) and $381.7 (2006), less accumulated amortization of       $88.2 and $102.7, respectively.
Certain       of the Companys borrowing arrangements contain covenants that require the       Company to maintain certain financial ratios and limit the amount of dividend       payments. Under the most restrictive requirement, $4,250.6 of retained earnings       was available for cash dividends at March 30, 2007.The Company was       in compliance with all covenants at March 30, 2007.
The       carrying value of the Companys long-term debt was $1,454.0 and $1,405.5 at       March 30, 2007 and March 31, 2006, as shown above. The corresponding fair value       was approximately $1,474.5 and $1,409.3 using the interest rates available       to       the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities.
Maturities       of long-term debt, capital lease payments, and other long-term obligations       by       fiscal year are $41.8 (2008), $527.6 (2009), $11.7 (2010), $12.3 (2011), $505.6       (2012), and $355.0 thereafter.

In general, the Company       would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default       in the performance of our obligations, the probability of which is remote in       managements opinion. The Company is in compliance with the performance       obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance       guarantee, and any liability incurred in connection with these guarantees would       not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of       operations or financial position. In addition, the Company has other guarantees       that represent parent guarantees in support of working capital credit lines       established with local financial institutions for its foreign business       units.

Under the collared       accelerated share repurchase transaction, which was effective July 5, 2006,       the       Company received an initial minimum delivery of common stock outstanding of       7.1       million shares for a payment of $500. The transactions were accounted for as       a       share retirement with common stock, paid-in capital and retained earnings       reduced by $16.4, $152.6 and $831.0, respectively. The Company will receive       additional shares pursuant to this agreement depending on movements in the       market price of the Companys common stock over the life of the       agreement.The agreement has a term of six to twelve months after       completion of the period establishing the hedge price, which was completed       on       July 28, 2006.
Under       both the accelerated share repurchase and the collared accelerated share       repurchase agreements, Goldman, Sachs & Co may repurchase an equivalent       number of shares in the open market over the terms of the respective       agreements.The accelerated share repurchase agreement may be       completed at any time between January 29, 2007 and June 29, 2007.At       the completion of the agreement, CSCs initial price under the accelerated share       repurchase agreement will be adjusted up or down based on the volume-weighted       average price (VWAP) of the stock during this period.Such adjustment       may be settled in cash or stock at the Companys discretion.The       collared accelerated share repurchase agreement may be completed at anytime       between January 29, 2007 and July 30, 2007. The Company financed the accelerated       share repurchase transactions initially with cash on hand and the issuance       of       approximately $600 of commercial paper.

Note       12Pension and Other Benefit Plans The       Company and its subsidiaries offer a number of pension and postretirement       benefit, life insurance benefit, deferred compensation, and other plans, as       described below.
A       contributory, defined benefit pension plan is generally available to U.S.       employees. Certain non-U.S. employees are enrolled in defined benefit pension       plans in the country of domicile. In addition, the Company has two supplemental       executive retirement plans (SERP), which are nonqualified, noncontributory       pension plans. The Company provides subsidized healthcare and life insurance       retirement benefits for certain U.S. employees, generally for those employed       prior to August 1992, as well as dental and prescription drug benefits for       certain Canadian employees. Most employees outside the U.S. are covered by       government sponsored programs at no direct cost to the Company other than       related payroll taxes.
CSC       utilizes actuarial methods required by SFAS No.87, Employers Accounting       for Pensions, and SFAS No.106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement       Benefits Other Than Pensions, to recognize the expense for pension and other       postretirement benefit plans, respectively.CSC has implemented SFAS       No.132(R) (as modified by SFAS No. 158), Employers Accounting for       Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, for financial statement       disclosures.Inherent in the application of these actuarial methods       are key assumptions, including, but not limited to, discount rates and expected       long-term rates of return on plan assets. Changes in the related pension and       other postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in       the       underlying assumptions, changes in the number and composition of plan       participants and changes in the level of benefits provided.
CSC       currently uses a measurement date of December 31 for the majority of its pension       and other postretirement benefit plans.

The       weighted-averages of the assumptions used to determine net periodic pension       cost       were: U.S.                 Plans Non-U.S.                 Plans 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Discount                 or settlement rates 5.9 % 5.9 % 6.3 % 4.9 % 5.3 % 5.4 % Expected                 long-term rates of return on assets 8.5 % 8.5 % 8.5 % 7.0 % 7.1 % 6.9 % Rates                 of increase in compensation levels 4.4 % 4.6 % 4.6 % 3.5 % 3.7 % 3.5 % The       discount rate assumption reflects       the market rate for high-quality, fixed income debt instruments as of our annual       measurement date and is therefore subject to change each year.The       required use of an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result       in recognized plan income that differs from the actual return on those plan       assets in any given year.Over time, the actual long-term rate of       return on plan assets is expected to approximate the return assumption       utilized.Differences between expected and actual returns are       recognized in the calculation of net periodic pension cost.Rate of       increase in compensation levels and other assumptions, such as turnover and       life       expectancy, also impact pension calculations.
The       expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is selected by       first       identifying the expected range of long-term rates of return for each major       asset       class.Expected long-term rates of return are developed based on       long-term historical averages as well as current expectations of future       returns.Consideration is given to the extent active management is       employed in each class.A single expected long-term rate of return on       plan assets is then calculated by weighing each class.
95 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       12Pension and Other Benefit Plans (Continued) The       asset       allocation of pension plans at December 31, 2006 and 2005 is as       follows: U.S.                 Plans Non-U.S.                 Plans Asset                 Category 2006 2005 2006 2005 Equity                 securities 70 % 70 % 64 % 63 % Debt                 securities 27 % 29 % 19 % 23 % Participant                 directed 8 % 8 % Other 3 % 1 % 9 % 6 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % The       Companys investment strategy for plan assets takes into account a number of       factors, including the time horizon of the pension plans obligations.For each of the largest plans, an allocation range       by asset class is developed.The allocation has a significant       weighting for equity investments in part due to the relatively long duration       of       the plans obligations.Third party investment managers are employed       to invest assets in both passively-indexed and actively-managed       strategies.The Companys allocation range for its largest plan is       60-76% equities, 23-31% debt securities and 0-10% cash and other       investments.The Company has typically used cash flow from       employer and employee contributions to keep allocations within the       range.The Company also has investments in insurance contracts to pay       plan benefits in certain countries.The allocation above does not       include certain amounts that are included in the fair value of assets such       as       cash awaiting investment or asset transfer receivable amounts from other       plans.

For       U.S. plans, a weighted-average       discount rate of 5.8% and 5.9% was used in the determination of the Companys       postretirement benefit obligation for the years ended March 30, 2007 and March       31, 2006, respectively.For non-U.S. plans, a weighted-average       discount rate of 5.5% and 5.2% was used in the determination of the Companys       postretirement healthcare obligation for the years ended March 30, 2007 and       March 31, 2006, respectively.
The       assumed healthcare cost trend rate used in measuring the expected benefit       obligation for U.S. postretirement benefit plans was 9.0% for fiscal 2007,       declining to 5.0% for 2013 and subsequent years.For the non-U.S.       postretirement benefit plans, it was 9.0% for fiscal 2007, declining to 5.0%       for       2017 and subsequent years.

The       weighted-averages of the assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit       cost       were as follows.See the above discussion of Pension Plans for how       the assumptions are developed.

The       asset       allocation for U.S. other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2006       and       2005 is as follows: Percentage                 of Plan Assets                 at Year End Asset                 Category 2006 2005 Equity                 securities 59 % 63 % Debt                 securities 33 % 33 % Cash 8 % 4 % Total 100 % 100 % 99 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       12Pension and Other Benefit Plans (Continued) The       Companys investment strategy for its funded post retirement benefits is similar       to the strategy for its pension assets.The Companys target       allocation for these assets is in the range of 50-70% equities, 30-50% debt       securities and 0-10% cash and other investments.
Information       about the expected cash flows for other postretirement benefit plans       follows.No significant cash flow is expected for other       postretirement benefit plans outside the U.S.

Other       Benefit Plans The       Company sponsors several defined contribution plans for substantially all U.S.       employees and certain foreign employees. The plans allow employees to contribute       a portion of their earnings in accordance with specified guidelines. At March       30, 2007, plan assets included 9,251,407 shares of the Companys common       stock.During fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, the Company       contributed $123.0, $123.6, and $108.1, respectively.
Effective       August14, 1995, the Company adopted the Computer Sciences Corporation       Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan). The Plan consists of two separate plans,       one for the benefit of key executives and one for the benefit of non-employee       directors. Pursuant to the Plan, certain management and highly compensated       employees are eligible to defer all or a portion of their regular salary that       exceeds the limitation set forth in Internal Revenue Section 401(a)(17) and       all       or a portion of their incentive compensation, and nonemployee directors are       eligible to defer up to 100% of their compensation. Each plan participant is       fully vested in all deferred compensation and earnings credited to his or her       account.
The       liability under this Plan amounted to $89.0 at March 30, 2007, and $83.1 at       March 31, 2006. The Companys expense under the Plan totaled $6.0, $5.8, and       $5.2 for fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively.
100 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       13Commitments and Contingencies Commitments The       Company has operating leases for the use of certain real estate and equipment.       Substantially all operating leases are non-cancelable or cancelable only by       the       payment of penalties. All lease payments are based on the lapse of time but       include, in some cases, payments for insurance, maintenance and property taxes.       There are no purchase options on operating leases at favorable terms, but most       real estate leases have one or more renewal options. Certain leases on real       estate are subject to annual escalations for increases in utilities and property       taxes. Lease rental expense amounted to $345.1, $299.6 and $330.8 for the years       ended March 30, 2007, March 31, 2006, and April 1, 2005,       respectively.
Minimum       fixed rentals required for the next five years and thereafter under operating       leases in effect at March 30, 2007 are as follows: Fiscal                 Year Real                 Estate Equipment 2008 $ 217.3 $ 84.8 2009 192.7 29.5 2010 160.2 15.4 2011 129.9 4.7 2012 64.5 .8 Thereafter 125.6 $ 890.2 $ 135.2 The       Company has signed long-term purchase agreements with certain software,       hardware, telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable       pricing and terms for services that are necessary for the operations of business       activities. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company is contractually       committed to purchase specified service minimums over periods ranging from       one       to five years. If the Company does not meet the specified service minimums,       the       Company would have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or all       of       the shortfall. Minimum purchase commitments for each of the subsequent five       years, fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2012, are as follows: $435.3, $279.1, $34.3,       $53.7 and $.1, respectively.In addition, the Company also has $39.3       of sublease income to be received through 2017.
Contingencies The       primary financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to       concentrations of credit risk are accounts receivable. The Companys customer       base includes Fortune 500 companies, the U.S. Federal and other governments       and       other significant, well-known companies operating in North America, Europe       and       the Pacific Rim. Credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is minimized       because of the nature and diversification of the Companys customer base.       Furthermore, the Company continuously reviews its accounts receivables and       records provisions for doubtful accounts as needed.
The       Company guarantees working capital credit lines established with local financial       institutions for its non-U.S. business units. Generally, guarantees have       one-year terms and are renewed annually. CSC guarantees up to $567.1 of such       working capital lines; however, as of March 30, 2007, the amount of the maximum       potential payment is $51.9, the amount of the related outstanding subsidiary       debt. The $51.9 outstanding debt is reflected in the Companys consolidated       financial statements.
The       Company generally indemnifies its software license customers from claims of       infringement on a United States patent, copyright, or trade secret. CSCs       indemnification covers costs to defend customers from claims, court awards       or       related settlements. The Company maintains the right to modify or replace       software in order to eliminate any infringement. Historically, CSC has not       incurred any significant costs related to customer software license       indemnification. Management considers the likelihood of incurring future costs       to be remote. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded a related       liability.
101 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       13Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) CSC       is       engaged in providing services under contracts with the U.S.       Government.The contracts are subject to extensive legal and       regulatory requirements and, from time to time, agencies of the U.S. Government       investigate whether the Companys operations are being conducted in accordance       with these requirements.U.S. Government investigations of the       Company, whether related to the Companys federal government contracts or       conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil or criminal       liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon the       Company, or could lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government       contracting.The Company believes it has adequately reserved for any       losses which may be experienced from these investigations.
In       the       course of business, discrepancies or claims may arise as to the use or       reliability of various software products provided by the Company for its       customers.On February 11, 2005, the Company was named, along with       other vendors to the insurance industry, and dozens of insurance companies       in       Hensley, et al. vs. Computer Sciences Corporation, et al., filed as a putative       nationwide class action in state court in Miller County, Arkansas shortly before       President Bush signed the Class Action Fairness Act into law.The       plaintiffs allege the defendants conspired to wrongfully use software products       licensed by the Company and the other software vendors to reduce the amount       paid       to the licensees insureds for bodily injury claims.Plaintiffs also       allege wrongful concealment of the manner in which these software programs       evaluate claims and wrongful concealment of information about alleged inherent       errors and flaws in the software.Plaintiffs seek injunctive and       monetary relief of less than $.075 for each class member, as well as attorneys       fees and costs.The Company is vigorously defending itself against       the allegations.
Litigation       is inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome       of the matters discussed above.Considering the early stage of the       Hensley case, the complicated issues presented by that matter, and the fact       that       no class has been certified, it is not possible at this time to make meaningful       estimates of the amount or range of loss that could result from this       matter.It is possible that the Companys business, financial       condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be affected by the       resolution of this matter.Whether any losses, damages or remedies       ultimately resulting from this proceeding could reasonably have a material       effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations, or       cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including, for example, the       timing and amount of such losses or damages, if any, and the structure and       type       of any such remedies.Depending on the ultimate resolution of these       matters, some may be material to the Companys operating results for a       particular period if an unfavorable outcome results, although such a material       unfavorable result is not presently expected, and all other litigation, in       the       aggregate, is not expected to result in a material adverse impact to the       consolidated financial statements.
As       reflected by Form 8-K filings made by Sears Holdings Corporation (SHC) on May       13, 2005 (following merger with K-Mart Holding Corporation), and by the Company       on May 16, 2005, HC's subsidiary, Sears, Roebuck and Co. (Sears), and the       Company are in dispute over amounts due and owing and applicable termination       fees following Sears' termination of its Master Services Agreement (Agreement)       with the Company on May 11, 2005. The dispute which also involves billings       for       continued services and counterclaim allegations by Sears of contract breaches       is       expected to be resolved pursuant to negotiations or legal and arbitration       proceedings. As of March 30, 2007, the Companys investment in net assets       associated with the Agreement was approximately $80. These net assets include       accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, outsourcing contract costs, software,       and       property, plant and equipment. The Company will vigorously pursue recovery       for       its associated assets and commitments. While the Company expects full recovery       of its investments associated with this Agreement, if unsuccessful, the Company       may experience a charge, which could be material, associated with the impairment       of these assets.
102 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       13Commitments and Contingencies(Continued) The       Company has converted 16 submitted Requests for Equitable Adjustment (REAs)       to       interest bearing claims under the Contract Disputes Act (CDA) totaling in excess       of $1,000 on two U.S. Federal contracts.Included in current assets       on the Companys balance sheet is approximately $820 of unbilled accounts       receivable and deferred costs related to the contracts.CSC has       requested payment for certain related out-of-scope work directed or caused       by       the customers in support of their critical missions.The contractual       modification process for scope changes has lagged behind the need for CSC to       provide critical on-going operational support.The Company does not       record any profit element when it defers costs associated with such       REAs/claims.The Company believes it has a legal basis for pursuing       recovery of these REAs/claims and that collection is probable with interest       on       the claims accruing but not being recognized.Settlement of the       amounts depends on individual circumstances, negotiations with the parties       and       prosecution of the claims; the Company is unable to predict the timing of       resolution of these claims.
Several       shareholders of the Company have filed purported derivative actions against       the       Company, as nominal defendant, as well as certain of CSC's executive officers       and directors. These actions generally allege that certain individual defendants       breached their fiduciary duty to the Company by purportedly backdating stock       options granted to CSC executives, improperly recording and accounting for       allegedly backdated stock options, producing and disseminating disclosures       that       improperly recorded and accounted for the allegedly backdated options, engaging       in acts of Corporate waste, and committing violations of insider trading laws.       They allege that certain of the defendants were unjustly enriched and seek       to       require them to disgorge their profits.The Company and certain       directors and other individuals have also been sued in a class action proceeding       alleging violations of the ERISA statute related to claims of alleged backdating       of stock options.
In       addition to the matters noted above, the Company is currently party to a number       of disputes which involve or may involve litigation.The Company       consults with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seeks       input from other experts and advisors with respect to other matters in the       ordinary course of business.Whether any losses, damages or remedies       ultimately resulting from such other matters could reasonably have a material       effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operation, or       cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including, for example, the       timing and amount of such losses or damages (if any) and the structure and       type       of any such remedies.For these reasons, it is not possible to make       reliable estimates of the amount or range of loss that could result from these       other matters at this time.Company management does not, however,       presently expect any of such other matters to have a material impact on the       consolidated financial statements of the Company.
Note       14Stock Incentive Plans Employee       Incentives The       Company has four stock incentive plans which authorize the issuance of stock       options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentives to employees upon       terms approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of       Directors.The Company issues authorized but previously unissued       shares upon the exercise of stock options, the granting of restricted stock       and       the redemption of restricted stock units (RSUs).The Companys       standard vesting schedule for stock options and stock awards (restricted stock       and RSUs) is one third on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant       date, except for certain stock awards where one third of the shares vest on       each       of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date.Prior       to April 2001, the Companys standard vesting schedule for stock options and       awards was one fifth of the shares vested on each of the first five       anniversaries of the grant date.Stock options are generally granted       for a term of ten years.

104 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       14Stock Incentive Plans (Continued) Stock       Awards Stock       awards consist of restricted stock and restricted stock units (RSUs).       Restricted stock awards consist of shares of common stock of the Company issued       at a price of $0. Upon issuance to an employee, shares of restricted stock       become outstanding, receive dividends and have voting rights. The shares are       subject to forfeiture and to restrictions which limit the sale or transfer       during the restriction period. The restrictions on shares of CSC restricted       stock normally lapse on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date       of       issuance for awards issued in lieu of cash bonuses and on the third, fourth       and       fifth anniversaries for all others. The restrictions on RSUs vest on the first,       second and third anniversaries of the date of issuance for those issued in       lieu       of cash bonuses, and on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries for all       others.Upon the vesting date, the RSUs are automatically redeemed       for shares of CSC common stock and dividend equivalents.
Information       concerning stock awards granted under stock incentive plans during fiscal 2007,       fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 is as follows: Number                 of Shares Weighted Average FairValue Outstanding                 at April 2, 2004 30,855 Granted 302,797 Released/Redeemed Forfeited/Canceled Outstanding                 at April 1, 2005 333,652 Granted 505,928 Released/Redeemed (10,589 ) Forfeited/Canceled (33,000 ) Outstanding                 at March 31, 2006 795,991 $ 42.48 Granted 560,752 55.35 Released/Redeemed (193,584 ) 45.13 Forfeited/Canceled (20,142 ) 45.22 Outstanding                 at March 30, 2007 1,143,017 48.30 As       of       March 30, 2007 there was $36.9 of total unrecognized compensation expense       related to unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock       units.The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average       period of 2.82 years.
Nonemployee       Director Incentives The       Company has two stock incentive plans which authorize the issuance of stock       options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentives to nonemployee       directors upon terms approved by the Companys Board of Directors. At March 30,       2007, 92,383 shares of CSC common stock remained available for the grant to       nonemployee directors of future RSUs or other stock-based       incentives.
105 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       14Stock Incentive Plans (Continued) Generally,       RSU awards to nonemployee directors vest in full as of the next annual meeting       of the Companys stockholders following the date they are granted and are issued       at a price of $0. Information concerning RSUs granted to nonemployee directors       during fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 is as follows: Number                 of Shares Weighted Average Fair                 Value Outstanding                 at April 2, 2004 68,817 Granted 13,000 Redeemed (12,532 ) Forfeited/Canceled Outstanding                 at April 1, 2005 69,285 Granted 11,400 Redeemed (21,164 ) Forfeited/Canceled Outstanding                 at March 31, 2006 59,521 $ 42.45 Granted 14,400 52.39 Redeemed (600 ) 37.81 Forfeited/Canceled Outstanding                 at March 30, 2007 73,321 44.44 When       a       holder of RSUs ceases to be a director of the Company, the RSUs are       automatically redeemed for shares of CSC common stock and dividend equivalents       with respect to such shares. The number of shares to be delivered upon       redemption is equal to the number of RSUs that are vested at the time the holder       ceases to be a director. At the holders election the RSUs may be redeemed (i)       as an entirety, upon the day the holder ceases to be a director, or (ii) in       substantially equal amounts upon the first five, ten or fifteen anniversaries       of       such termination of service.
As       of       March 30, 2007 there was $0.3 of total unrecognized compensation expense related       to unvested nonemployee director RSUs.The cost is expected to be       fully recognized as of the annual stockholders meeting on July 30,       2007.
Note       15Stockholder Purchase Rights Plan On       February 18, 1998, the Company adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to       which it issued one right for each outstanding share of its common stock. These       rights, which are attached to and trade only together with the common stock,       are       not currently exercisable. On the tenth business day after any person or entity       becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of CSCs common stock, each right       (other than rights held by the 15% stockholder, which will become void) will       become exercisable to purchase, for $250, CSC common stock having a market       value       of $500. The rights expire February 18, 2008, and may be redeemed by the Board       of Directors at $.0005 per right at any time before they become       exercisable.
106 COMPUTER       SCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES       TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Dollars       in millions except per-share amounts) Note       16Segment and Geographic Information All       of       the Companys business involves operations which provide I/T outsourcing,       consulting and system integration services and other professional services.       Although the Company presents estimates of revenue by business service and       geography, the Companys expenses and assets are not identified or accumulated       in this manner due to, among other reasons, cross-utilization of personnel       and       assets across the Company. Based on SFAS No. 131 criteria, the Company       aggregates operating segments into two reportable segments that consist of       the       North American Public Sector (formerly U.S. Federal Sector) and Global       Commercial. The Company organizes Global Commercial operating segments by       geographies and vertical operations. These operations serve large-scale       corporations and organizations in a wide array of industries. The operating       segments provide outsourcing, systems integration, consulting, and professional       services within their assigned target geographic or vertical market. Further,       operating segments service offerings and clientele overlap and the Company       draws on multiple operating segments to serve clients.
As       a       result, the aggregated operating segments have similar economic characteristics,       products, services, customers and methods of operation. The North American       Public Sector operates principally within a regulatory environment subject       to       governmental contracting and accounting requirements, including Federal       Acquisition Regulations, Cost Accounting Standards and audits by various U.S.       federal agencies. The Company utilizes uniform accounting policies across all       of       its operating units (see Note 1). The table below presents financial information       for the three fiscal years ended March 30, 2007, for the two reportable       segments, and for financial items that cannot be allocated to either operating       segment: Global Commercial Sector North                 American Public Sector Corporate Total 2007 Revenues $ 9,506.3 $ 5,350.3 $ 14,856.6 Earnings                 (loss) before special                 items, interest and taxes 758.0 363.6 $ (72.8 ) 1,048.8 Depreciation                 and                 amortization 915.0 141.2 17.4 1,073.6 Assets 9,476.6 3,685.2 568.7 13,730.5 Capital                 expenditures for                 long-lived assets 837.8 74.1 40.9 952.8 2006                  As Restated (1) Revenues $ 9,585.0 $ 5,054.0 $ 14,639.0 Earnings                 (loss) before special                 items, interest and taxes 665.7 352.7 $ (57.7 ) 960.7 Depreciation                 and                 amortization 931.6 142.9 17.3 1,091.8 Assets 8,345.5 3,511.8 1,164.4 13,021.7 Capital                 expenditures for                 long-lived assets 1,105.6 85.0 29.9 1,220.5 2005                  As Restated (1) Revenues $ 9,404.1 $ 4,675.9 $ 14,080.0 Earnings                 (loss) before special                 items, interest and taxes 642.9 313.3 $ (104.0 ) 852.2 Depreciation                 and                 amortization 890.6 142.3 18.1 1,051.0 Assets 8,810.2 3,169.7 623.3 12,603.2 Capital                 expenditures for                 long-lived assets 1,248.0 185.1 36.2 1,469.3 (1)See       Note 2, "Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements.

The       Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from departments and       agencies of the United States government. U.S. Federal government revenue       accounted for 36%, 35% and 33% of the Companys revenues for fiscal 2007, 2006       and 2005, respectively. At March 30, 2007, approximately 46% of the Companys       accounts receivable were due from the federal government. No single commercial       customer exceeded 10% of the Companys revenues during fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006       or fiscal 2005.
Note       17Agreements with Equifax The       Company has an agreement (the Operating Agreement) with Equifax Inc. and its       subsidiary, Equifax Credit Information Services, Inc. (ECIS), pursuant to which       certain of the Companys subsidiaries (collectively, the Bureaus) are affiliated       credit bureaus of ECIS and utilize ECIS credit database to provide credit       reporting services from the ECIS system for resale to their customers. The       Bureaus retain ownership of their credit files stored in the ECIS system and       receive revenues generated from the sale of the credit information they contain.       The Bureaus pay ECIS a fee for storing and maintaining the files and for each       report supplied by the ECIS system.

124 PART       II (Continued) Item       9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial       Disclosure None.
Item       9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and       Procedures Disclosure       controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures of an issuer that       are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer       in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Securities Exchange Act of       1934, as amended (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,       within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions       rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without       limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required       to be disclosed by an issuer in its Exchange Act reports is accumulated and       communicated to the issuers management, including its principal executive and       financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required       disclosure.
The       Company has completed the investigation of its stock option grant practices,       as       reported by the Company in the Form 8-K filed February 28, 2007 with the       Securities and Exchange Commission.The investigation resulted in       adjustments to the Companys previously issued financial statements (refer to       Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included herein).The       Company has concluded these adjustments resulted from control deficiencies       which       existed in prior years over the stock option grant process, but which the       Company believes were remediated subsequent to December 29, 2006.
Under       the       direction of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,       the Company has evaluated the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of       March 30, 2007.We have identified the following material weakness in       our internal control over financial reporting:there are insufficient       knowledgeable and competent personnel in certain key positions within the tax       function and processes and procedures over accounting for income taxes are       not       adequate for the Companys size and complexity.This material       weakness and the resulting restatement are further discussed in the Management       Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and in Note 2 to the       consolidated financial statements.As a result of this material       weakness, the Company has concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures       were not effective as of March 30, 2007. See Management Report on Internal       Control over Financial Reporting and Report of Independent Registered Public       Accounting Firm on pages 49 and 50 through 52 of this Annual Report on Form       10-K.
Changes       in Internal Controls Internal       controls over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the       supervision of, the issuers principal executive and financial officers, and       effected by the issuers board of directors, management, and other personnel, to       provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting       and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes       in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those       policies and procedures that: (1)pertain       to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly       reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the       issuer; (2)provide       reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit       preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally       accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer       are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors       of the issuer; and (3)provide       reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized       acquisition, use or disposition of the issuers assets that could have a       material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
There       was       no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the       fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2007, that has materially affected, or is       reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over       financial reporting.The Company has initiated remediation measures       to address the material weakness over the accounting for income       taxes.These measures include recruitment of executive tax personnel,       re-evaluation of the overall organization structure and reassignment of       responsibilities within the function, recruitment of additional staff personnel       with tax, accounting and financial reporting expertise and improvement in the       tax provision process and the underlying procedures and internal       controls.
