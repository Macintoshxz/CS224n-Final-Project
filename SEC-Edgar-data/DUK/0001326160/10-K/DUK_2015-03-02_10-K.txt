PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS DUKE ENERGY General Duke Energy Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Duke Energy) is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy Carolinas), Duke Energy Progress, Inc. (Duke Energy Progress) (formerly Carolina Power & Light Company d/b/a Progress Energy Carolinas), Duke Energy Florida, Inc. (Duke Energy Florida) (formerly Florida Power Corporation d/b/a Progress Energy Florida), Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. (Duke Energy Ohio), and Duke Energy Indiana, Inc. (Duke Energy Indiana), as well as in Latin America. When discussing Duke Energys consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of its six separate subsidiary registrants, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Progress Energy, Inc. (Progress Energy), Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, and Duke Energy Indiana, which are collectively referred to as the Subsidiary Registrants. All of these entities, along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.
The Duke Energy Registrants electronically file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxies and amendments to such reports.
The public may read and copy any materials the Duke Energy Registrants file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Additionally, information about the Duke Energy Registrants, including reports filed with the SEC, is available through Duke Energys website at http://www.duke-energy.com. Such reports are accessible at no charge and are made available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC.
Business Segments Duke Energy conducts its operations in three business segments; Regulated Utilities, International Energy and Commercial Power. The remainder of Duke Energys operations are presented as Other. Duke Energys chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. For additional information on each of these business segments, including financial and geographic information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Business Segments.
The following sections describe the business and operations of each of Duke Energys reportable business segments, as well as Other.
regulated utilities Regulated Utilities conducts operations primarily through Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana, and the regulated transmission and distribution operations of Duke Energy Ohio. These electric and gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC), the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC), the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC), the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC), and the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC).
Regulated Utilities serves 7.2 million retail electric customers in six states in the Southeast and Midwest regions of the United States. Its service area covers approximately 104,000 square miles with an estimated population of 21 million people. Regulated Utilities serves 500,000 retail natural gas customers in southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. Electricity is also sold wholesale to incorporated municipalities, electric cooperative utilities and other load-serving entities.
The following table represents the distribution of billed sales by customer class for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Primary   industrial sectors include textiles, chemicals, rubber and plastics, paper,   food and beverage, and auto manufacturing.
(b) Primary general service sectors include tourism, healthcare and   agriculture. Primary industrial sectors include phosphate rock mining and   processing, electronics design and manufacturing, and citrus and other food   processing.
(c) Primary general service sectors include healthcare, education,   real estate and rental leasing, financial and insurance services, and   wholesale trade services. Primary industrial sectors include aerospace,   primary metals, chemicals and food.
(d) Primary general service sectors include retail, financial,   healthcare and education services. Primary industrial sectors include primary   and fabricated metals, transportation equipment, building materials, food and   beverage, and chemicals.
The number of residential, general service and industrial customers within the Regulated Utilities service territory is expected to increase over time. However, growth in the near-term is being hampered by the current economic conditions. Average usage per residential customer is 9 PART I expected to remain flat for the foreseeable future. While total industrial sales increased in 2013 when compared to 2012, the growth rate was modest when compared to historical periods.
Seasonality and the Impact of Weather Regulated Utilities costs and revenues are influenced by seasonal patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, resulting in higher revenue and cash flows in these periods. By contrast, lower sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance. Peak gas sales occur during the winter months. Residential and general service customers are most impacted by weather. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions.
The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances from a normal condition and customers historic usage levels and patterns. The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not and cannot consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity and relative temperature changes. The precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to shorter term periods.
Degree-day data are used to estimate energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures based on each days average temperature. Heating-degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. Cooling-degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature. Each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating-degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling-degree day.
Competition Retail Regulated Utilities businesses operate as the sole supplier of electricity within their service territories, with the exception of Ohio, which has a competitive electricity supply market. Regulated Utilities owns and operates all of the facilities necessary to generate, transmit and distribute electricity. Services are priced by state commission approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices. Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from on-site generation of industrial customers and distributed generation, such as rooftop solar, at residential, general service and/or industrial customer sites.
Regulated Utilities is not aware of any proposed legislation in any jurisdiction that would give its retail customers the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry.
Although there is no pending legislation at this time, if the retail jurisdictions served by Regulated Utilities become subject to deregulation, the recovery of stranded costs could become a significant consideration. Stranded costs primarily include the generation assets of Regulated Utilities whose value in a competitive marketplace may be less than their current book value, as well as above-market purchased power commitments from qualified facilities (QFs). QFs are typically small power production facilities that generate power within a utility companys service territory for which the utility companies are legally obligated to purchase the energy at an avoided cost rate. Thus far, all states that have passed restructuring legislation have provided for the opportunity to recover a substantial portion of stranded costs.
Regulated Utilities largest stranded cost exposure is primarily related to Duke Energy Floridas purchased power commitments with QFs, under which it has future minimum expected capacity payments through 2025 of $3.5 billion. Duke Energy Florida was obligated to enter into these contracts under provisions of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. Duke Energy Florida continues to seek ways to address the impact of escalating payments under these contracts. However, the FPSC allows full recovery of the retail portion of the cost of power purchased from QFs. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information related these purchased power commitments.
In Ohio, Regulated Utilities conducts competitive auctions for electricity supply. The cost of energy purchased through these auctions is recovered from retail customers. Regulated Utilities earns retail margin in Ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity only and not on the cost of the underlying energy.
Wholesale Regulated Utilities competes with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales, sales to municipalities and cooperatives, and wholesale transactions. The principal factors in competing for these sales are price, availability of capacity and power, and reliability of service. Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs.
Increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect Regulated Utilities load forecasts, plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues. Wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of Regulated Utilities to attract new customers and to retain existing customers.
Energy Capacity and Resources Regulated Utilities owns approximately 50,000 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity. For additional information on Regulated Utilities generation facilities, see Item 2, Properties.
Energy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause Regulated Utilities to purchase power for its customers include generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, generation reliability, growth, and price. Regulated Utilities has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and energy, and reliability of power supply.
10 PART I Regulated Utilities generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve retail customers. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements.
Recently Completed Generation Projects Regulated Utilities completed its generation fleet modernization program in 2013. The additional capacity from this program has allowed Regulated Utilities to retire or plan to retire older, less efficient capacity. The following table summarizes the generation projects constructed and placed in service during the past three years.
Megawatts Fuel Commercial   Operation Cost (in   millions) Duke Energy Carolinas Cliffside Unit 6 825 Coal 2012 $ 2,100 Duke Energy Carolinas Buck Combined Cycle 620 Natural   Gas 2011 675 Duke Energy Carolinas Dan River Combined Cycle 620 Natural   Gas 2012 675 Duke Energy Progress H.F.

The IRPs provide a view of forecasted energy needs over a long term (15-20 years) and options being considered to meet those needs. The IRPs filed by the Subsidiary Registrants in 2013 and 2012 included planning assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating facilities earlier than their current estimated useful lives. These facilities do not have the requisite emission control equipment, primarily to meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations that are not yet effective. These facilities total approximately 2,447 MW at five sites. Duke Energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these coal-fired generating facilities earlier than the current estimated useful lives, and plans to seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise recovered when any assets are retired. For additional information related to potential plant retirements see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters.
Sources of Electricity Regulated Utilities relies principally on coal, natural gas and nuclear fuel for its generation of electricity. The following table lists sources of electricity and fuel costs for the three years ended December 31, 2013.
Generation   by Source (a)(e) Cost of   Delivered Fuel per Net Kilowatt-hour   Generated (Cents) (a)(e) 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Coal (b) 35.7 % 39.1 % 52.6 % 3.67 3.55 3.17 Nuclear (b) 28.7 % 30.8 % 33.0 % 0.66 0.62 0.55 Oil and gas (b) 21.3 % 14.0 % 1.2 % 4.18 4.03 5.89 All fuels (cost-based on weighted average) (b) 85.7 % 83.9 % 86.8 % 2.79 2.55 2.21 Hydroelectric and solar (c) 1.5 % 0.8 % 0.9 % Total generation 87.2 % 84.7 % 87.7 % Purchased power and net interchange (d) 12.8 % 15.3 % 12.3 % Total sources of energy 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % (a) Statistics include Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida   beginning July 2, 2012.
(b) Statistics related to all fuels reflect Regulated Utilities'   ownership interest in jointly owned generation facilities.
(c) Generating figures are net of output required to replenish   pumped storage facilities during off-peak periods.
(d) Purchased power includes renewable energy purchases.
(e) Includes the effect of the Joint Dispatch Agreement (JDA) and   Mitigation Sales. Mitigation sales are excluded from the Regulated Utilities   segment.
Coal Regulated Utilities meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long-term purchase contracts and short-term spot market purchase agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under long-term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. Regulated Utilities uses spot-market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by long-term contracts. Expiration dates for its long-term contracts, which have various price adjustment provisions and market re-openers, range from 2014 to 2016 for Duke Energy Carolinas, 2014 to 2018 for Duke Energy Progress, 2014 to 2016 for Duke Energy Florida, and 2014 to 2025 for Duke Energy Indiana. Regulated Utilities expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. Coal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Florida is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Indiana is primarily produced in Indiana and Illinois. Regulated Utilities has an adequate supply of coal under contract to fuel its projected 2014 operations and a significant portion of supply to fuel its projected 2015 operations. Coal inventory levels have begun to normalize during the past year as weather patterns have trended closer to historical averages, combined with improving economic indicators and higher natural gas prices, which are resulting in higher coal-fired generation. Significantly colder than normal temperatures in December 2013 and January 2014 continued the trend of higher natural gas prices and increased coal-fired generation.
11 PART I The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by Regulated Utilities is between 1.5 percent and 2 percent for Duke Energy Carolinas, between 1.5 percent and 2 percent for Duke Energy Progress, between 1 percent and 2.5 percent for Duke Energy Florida, and between 2 percent and 3 percent for Duke Energy Indiana. Regulated Utilities environmental controls, in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emission allowances, enable Regulated Utilities to satisfy current SO 2 emission limitations for its existing facilities.
Nuclear The industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, and services to convert, enrich, and fabricate fuel assemblies.
Regulated Utilities has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors. Uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, country of origin and pricing. Regulated Utilities staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements in the near-term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter. Near-term requirements not met by long-term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases. Due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services, Regulated Utilities generally sources these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis using multi-year contracts.
Regulated Utilities has entered into fuel contracts that cover 100 percent of its uranium concentrates, conversion services, and enrichment services requirements through at least 2014 and cover fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least 2018. For future requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, Regulated Utilities believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire, or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services.
Oil and Gas Oil and natural gas supply for Regulated Utilities generation fleet is purchased under term and spot contracts from various suppliers. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana use derivative instruments to limit a portion of their exposure to price fluctuations for natural gas. Regulated Utilities has dual-fuel generating facilities that can operate with both fuel oil and natural gas. The cost of Regulated Utilities oil and natural gas is either at a fixed price or determined by market prices as reported in certain industry publications. Regulated Utilities believes it has access to an adequate supply of oil and gas for the reasonably foreseeable future. Regulated Utilities natural gas transportation for its gas generation is purchased under term firm transportation contracts with interstate and intrastate pipelines. Regulated Utilities may also purchase additional shorter-term transportation for its load requirements during peak periods. The Regulated Utilities natural gas plants are served by several supply zones and multiple pipelines.
Purchased Power Regulated Utilities purchased approximately 11.7 million megawatt-hours (MWh), 19.8 million MWh and 19.0 million MWh of its system energy requirements during 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, under purchase obligations and leases and had 3,800 and 4,500 MW of firm purchased capacity under contract during 2013 and 2012, respectively. These amounts include MWh for Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida for all periods presented. These agreements include approximately 398 MW of firm capacity under contract by Duke Energy Florida with certain QFs. Regulated Utilities may need to acquire additional purchased power capacity in the future to accommodate a portion of its system load needs. Regulated Utilities believes that it can obtain adequate purchased power to meet these needs. However, during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power may be significantly affected.
Gas for Retail Distribution Regulated Utilities is responsible for the purchase and the subsequent delivery of natural gas to retail customers in its Ohio and Kentucky service territories. Regulated Utilities natural gas procurement strategy is to buy firm natural gas supplies and firm interstate pipeline transportation capacity during the winter season and during the non-heating season through a combination of firm supply and transportation capacity along with spot supply and interruptible transportation capacity. This strategy allows Regulated Utilities to assure reliable natural gas supply for its non-curtailable customers during peak winter conditions and provides Regulated Utilities the flexibility to reduce its contract commitments if firm customers choose alternate gas. In 2013, firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided approximately 100 percent of the natural gas supply.
Inventory Generation of electricity is capital intensive. Regulated Utilities must maintain an adequate stock of fuel and materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2013, the inventory balance for Regulated Utilities was $3,043 million. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information.
Dan River Ash Basin Release On February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke Energy Carolinas retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe stopping the release of materials into the river. Duke Energy Carolinas estimates 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash and 24 million to 27 million gallons of basin water were released into the river.
Duke Energy cannot reasonably estimate the cost associated with remediation of this release at this time. Other costs related to the Dan River release and other ash basins, including regulatory directives, natural resources damages, future lawsuits, future claims, long-term environmental impact costs, long-term operational changes, and costs associated with new laws and regulations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
12 PART I Nuclear Matters Regulated Utilities owns, wholly or partially, 12 nuclear reactors located at seven stations. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property, decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and replacement power expense coverage. Joint owners reimburse Regulated Utilities for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which currently is $13.6 billion. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies  Nuclear Insurance, for more information.
Regulated Utilities has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC, FPSC and PSCSC require Regulated Utilities to update their cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years.
The following table summarizes the fair value of nuclear decommissioning trust fund (NDTF) balances and cost study results for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, and Duke Energy Florida.
NDTF December   31, 2013 December   31, 2012 Decommissioning   Costs (a) (b) Year of   Cost Study Duke Energy Carolinas $ 2,840 $ 2,354 $ 3,420 2013 Duke Energy Progress 1,539 1,259 3,000 2009 Duke Energy Florida 753 629 1,083 2013 (a) Represents cost per the most recent site-specific nuclear   decommissioning cost studies, including costs to decommission plant   components not subject to radioactive contamination.
(b) Includes the Subsidiary Registrants' ownership interest in   jointly owned reactors. Other joint owners are responsible for   decommissioning costs related to their interest in the reactors.
The NCUC, FPSC and PSCSC have allowed Regulated Utilities to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail rates over the expected remaining service periods of their nuclear stations. Regulated Utilities believes the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates, when coupled with the existing fund balance and expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information.
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (as amended) (NWPA) provides the framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities for high-level radioactive waste materials. The NWPA promotes increased usage of interim storage of spent nuclear fuel at existing nuclear plants. Regulated Utilities will continue to maximize the use of spent fuel storage capability within its own facilities for as long as feasible.
Under federal law, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. Delays have occurred in the DOEs proposed permanent repository to be located at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.
Until the DOE begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida will continue to safely manage their spent nuclear fuel. With certain modifications and additional approvals by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), including the expansion of on-site dry cask storage facilities, spent nuclear fuel storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space for spent fuel through the expiration of the operating licenses, including any license renewals, for all sites except Shearon Harris Nuclear Station (Harris) and Crystal River Unit 3. Under current regulatory guidelines, Harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license. Crystal River Unit 3 was retired in 2013, with plans to place the facility in SAFSTOR (extended storage) prior to final decommissioning. An on-site dry cask storage facility will be installed to accommodate storage of all spent nuclear fuel until the DOE accepts the spent nuclear fuel.
The nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long-term availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, compliance with changing regulatory requirements, capital outlays for modifications and new plant construction, the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning plants at the end of their licensed lives, and requirements relating to nuclear insurance. Nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages, repairs, uprates and certain other modifications.
Regulated Utilities is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC for the design, construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities. The following table includes the current expiration of nuclear operating licenses.
Unit Year of   Expiration Duke Energy Carolinas Catawba Unit 1 2043 Catawba Unit 2 2043 McGuire Unit 1 2041 McGuire Unit 2 2043 Oconee Unit 1 2033 Oconee Unit 2 2033 Oconee Unit 3 2034 Duke Energy Progress Brunswick Unit 1 2036 Brunswick Unit 2 2034 Harris 2046 Robinson 2030 Duke Energy Florida Crystal River Unit 3 (a) 2016 (a) Duke Energy Florida has requested the NRC terminate the Crystal   River Unit 3 operating license as a result of the retirement of the unit.
13 PART I The NRC issues orders with regard to security at nuclear plants in response to new or emerging threats. The most recent orders include additional restrictions on nuclear plant access, increased security measures at nuclear facilities and closer coordination with intelligence, military, law enforcement and emergency response functions at the federal, state and local levels. As the NRC, other governmental entities and the industry continue to consider security issues, it is possible that more extensive security plans could be required.
Regulation State The NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC, PUCO, IURC and KPSC (collectively, the state utility commissions) approve rates for retail electric and gas service within their respective states. The state utility commissions, except for the PUCO, also have authority over the construction and operation of Regulated Utilities generating facilities. Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity ( CPCN) issued by the state utility commissions, as applicable, authorize Regulated Utilities to construct and operate its electric facilities, and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state utility commission is required for Regulated Utilities to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.
Each of the state utility commissions allows recovery of certain costs through various cost-recovery clauses, to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over or under-recovered costs, are prudent. The clauses are in addition to approved base rates.
Fuel, fuel-related costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by Regulated Utilities. Regulated Utilities uses coal, oil, hydroelectric, natural gas and nuclear fuel to generate electricity, thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of Regulated Utilities, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for fuel costs and recovery from ratepayers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of Regulated Utilities.
The following table summarizes base rate cases approved and effective in the past three years.

(h) Capital structure includes deferred income tax, customer   deposits and investment tax credits.
For more information on rate matters and other regulatory proceedings, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters  Rate Related Information.
14 PART I Federal The FERC approves Regulated Utilities cost-based rates for electric sales to certain wholesale customers, as well as sales of transmission service. Regulations of FERC and the state utility commissions govern access to regulated electric and gas customers and other data by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of nonregulated affiliates with Regulated Utilities.
Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO).
PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) and Midcontinent Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO) are the Independent System Operators (ISO) and FERC-approved RTOs for the regions in which Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana operate. PJM and MISO operate energy, capacity and other markets, and, through central dispatch, control the day-to-day operations of bulk power systems.
Duke Energy Ohio is a member of PJM and Duke Energy Indiana is a member of MISO. Transmission owners in these RTOs have turned over control of their transmission facilities, and their transmission systems are currently under the dispatch control of the RTOs. Transmission service is provided on a region-wide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the RTO members at rates based on the costs of transmission service.
Environmental.
Regulated Utilities is subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. For a discussion of environmental regulation, see Environmental Matters in this section.
See Other Issues section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion about potential Global Climate Change legislation and other EPA regulations under development and the potential impacts such legislation and regulation could have on Duke Energys operations.
INTERNATIONAL ENERGY International Energy principally operates and manages power generation facilities and engages in sales and marketing of electric power, natural gas, and natural gas liquids outside the U.S. Its activities principally target power generation in Latin America. Additionally, International Energy owns a 25 percent interest in National Methanol Company (NMC), a large regional producer of methanol and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) located in Saudi Arabia. International Energys ownership interest will decrease to 17.5 percent by the end of 2016. The investment in NMC is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
International Energys customers include retail distributors, electric utilities, independent power producers, marketers, and industrial and commercial companies. International Energys current strategy is focused on optimizing the value of its current Latin American portfolio and expanding the portfolio through investment in generation opportunities in Latin America.
For information on International Energys generation facilities, see Item 2, Properties.
Competition and Regulation International Energys sales and marketing of electric power and natural gas competes directly with other generators and marketers serving its market areas. Competitors are country and region-specific but include government-owned electric generating companies, local distribution companies with self-generation capability and other privately owned electric generating and marketing companies. The principal elements of competition are price and availability, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.
A high percentage of International Energys portfolio consists of baseload hydroelectric generation facilities, which compete with other forms of electric generation available to International Energys customers and end-users, including natural gas and fuel oils. Economic activity, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, weather, additional generation capacities and other factors affect the supply and demand for electricity in the regions served by International Energy.
International Energys operations are subject to both country-specific and international laws and regulations. (See Environmental Matters in this section.) COMMERCIAL POWER Commercial Power owns, operates and manages power plants and engages in the wholesale marketing and procurement of electric power, fuel and emission allowances related to these plants as well as other contractual positions. Commercial Powers generation operations consist primarily of Duke Energy Ohios coal-fired and gas-fired nonregulated generation assets located in the Midwest region of the United States and wind and solar generation located throughout the United States. The asset portfolio has a diversified fuel mix with baseload and mid-merit coal-fired units as well as combined cycle and peaking natural gas-fired units.
Generation from the coal-fired and gas-fired assets is dispatched into the PJM wholesale market. These assets earn energy and capacity revenue at market prices. Duke Energy Ohio is a PJM Fixed Resource Requirement (FRR) entity through May 31, 2015. As an FRR entity, Duke Energy Ohio is obligated to self-supply capacity for the Duke Energy Ohio load zone. Commercial Power has economically hedged its forecasted coal-fired generation and a significant portion of its forecasted gas-fired generation for 2014. Commercial Power also has long-term economic hedges in place for a portion of expected coal and gas generation through 2017 and 2018, respectively. Capacity revenues are 100 percent fixed in PJM through May 2017.
Energy and renewable energy credits generated by wind and solar projects are generally sold at contractual prices. Contracts are executed with load serving entities, which, in most instances, have obligations under state-mandated renewable energy portfolio standards or similar state or local renewable energy goals. Most contracts have a term which approximates the estimated useful life of the underlying generation project. In addition, Commercial Power operates and develops transmission projects.
For information on Commercial Powers generation facilities, see Item 2, Properties.
15 PART I Commercial Power also has a retail sales subsidiary, Duke Energy Retail Sales, LLC (Duke Energy Retail), which is certified by the PUCO as a Competitive Retail Electric Supplier (CRES) provider in Ohio. Duke Energy Retail serves retail electric and gas customers in Ohio with energy and other energy services at competitive rates.
Capacity Rider Filing On August 29, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio applied to the PUCO for the establishment of a charge for capacity provided pursuant to its obligations as an FRR entity. The charge, which is consistent with Ohios state compensation mechanism, is estimated to be approximately $729 million, and reflects Duke Energy Ohios embedded cost of capacity. On February 13, 2013, the PUCO denied Duke Energy Ohios request.
Midwest Generation Exit On February 17, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio announced that it had initiated a process to exit its nonregulated Midwest generation business. Considering a marketing period of several months and potential regulatory approvals, Duke Energy Ohio expects to dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business by early to mid-2015. In the first quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Ohio will reclassify approximately $3.5 billion carrying value of its Midwest generation business to assets held for sale and expects to record an estimated pretax impairment charge of $1 billion to $2 billion to reduce the carrying value to estimated sales proceeds less cost to sell.
Other Matters Commercial Power is subject to regulation at the federal level, primarily from the FERC. Regulations of the FERC govern access to regulated electric customer and other data by nonregulated entities, services provided between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates, and Commercial Powers investments in transmission projects. These regulations affect the activities of Commercial Power.
For more information on rate matters, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters  Rate Related Information.
Commercial Power is subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. (For a discussion of environmental regulation, see Environmental Matters in this section.) See Other Issues section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion about potential Global Climate Change legislation and other EPA regulations under development, and the potential impacts such legislation could have on Duke Energys operations.
Market Environment and Competition The market price of commodities and services, along with the quality and reliability of services provided, drive competition in the wholesale energy business. Commercial Powers main competitors include other nonregulated generators and wholesale power providers.
Sources of Electricity Commercial Power relies on coal and natural gas for its generation of electric energy.
Coal Commercial Power meets its coal demand through a portfolio of purchase supply contracts and spot agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under supply contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. Commercial Power uses spot-market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by supply contracts. Expiration dates for its supply contracts, which have various price adjustment provisions and market re-openers, range through 2018. Commercial Power expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers for the quantities and quality of coal required as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. The majority of Commercial Powers coal is sourced from mines in the Northern Appalachian and Illinois basins. Commercial Power has an adequate supply of coal to fuel its projected 2014 operations. The majority of Commercial Powers coal-fired generation is equipped with environmental controls. As a result, Commercial Power is able to satisfy the current emission limitations for SO 2 for existing facilities.
Gas Commercial Power is responsible for the purchase of natural gas to its gas turbine generators. In general Commercial Power hedges its natural gas requirements using physical and financial contracts. Physical gas is purchased in the spot market and under long-term contracts to meet generation needs.

19 PART I ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to other disclosures within this Form 10-K, including Managements Discussion and Analysis  Matters Impacting Future Results for each registrant in Item 7, and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be considered in evaluating Duke Energy and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought. Unless otherwise indicated, risk factors discussed below generally relate to risks associated with all of the Duke Energy Registrants. Risks identified at the Subsidiary Registrant level are generally applicable to Duke Energy.
Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks The Duke Energy Registrants regulated electric revenues, earnings and results are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs.
The Duke Energy Registrants regulated utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky. If the Duke Energy Registrants regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease the Duke Energy Registrants future earnings. Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, the Duke Energy Registrants future earnings could be negatively impacted.
If legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the Duke Energy Registrants exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers were eroded, their future earnings could be negatively impacted.
Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants financial position, results of operations or cash flows and their utility businesses.
Increased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring legislation could have a significant adverse impact on the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Retail competition and the unbundling of regulated electric service could have a significant adverse financial impact on the Duke Energy Registrants due to an impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of capital. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict if or when they will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The Duke Energy Registrants businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation that will affect their operations and costs.
The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to regulation by FERC, NRC, EPA and various other federal agencies. Regulation affects almost every aspect of the Duke Energy Registrants businesses, including, among other things, their ability to: take fundamental business management actions; determine the terms and rates of transmission and distribution services; make acquisitions; issue equity or debt securities; engage in transactions with other subsidiaries and affiliates; and pay dividends upstream to the Duke Energy Registrants. Changes to federal regulations are continuous and ongoing. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the future course of regulatory changes or the ultimate effect those changes will have on their businesses. However, changes in regulation can cause delays in or affect business planning and transactions and can substantially increase the Duke Energy Registrants costs.
The Dan River ash basin release could impact the financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants.
There is uncertainty regarding the extent and timing of the costs and liabilities relating to the Dan River ash basin release, including the amount and extent of any civil or criminal penalties, and resulting litigation. These uncertainties are likely to continue for an extended period and may cause costs to increase. Thus, the Dan River ash basin release could have a material adverse impact on the Duke Energy Registrants financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, releases of a similar nature at any of the Duke Energy Registrants other ash basins could also result in a material adverse impact to their financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations requiring significant capital expenditures that can increase the cost of operations, and which may impact or limit business plans, or cause exposure to environmental liabilities.
The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating, and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the Duke Energy Registrants to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets. The steps the Duke Energy Registrants could be required to take to ensure their facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive. As a result, the Duke Energy Registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facilities, which may cause the Duke Energy Registrants to incur losses. Further, the Duke Energy Registrants regulatory rate structure and their contracts with customers may not necessarily allow for the recovery of capital costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations. Also, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for their operating assets or development projects. Delays in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, failure to obtain and comply with them or changes in environmental laws or regulations to more stringent compliance levels could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or development of new facilities being prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. Although it is not expected that the costs of complying with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants financial position, results of operations or cash flows due to regulatory cost recovery, no assurance can be made that the costs of complying with environmental regulations in the future will not have such an effect.
The EPA has proposed new federal regulations governing the management of coal combustion by-products, cooling water intake structures, wastewater and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. These regulations, as well as new regulations or legislative actions resulting from the Dan 20 PART I River ash basis release, may require the Duke Energy Registrants to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance costs.
Duke Energys investments and projects located outside of the U.S. expose it to risks related to the laws, taxes, economic and political conditions, and policies of foreign governments. These risks may delay or reduce Duke Energys realization of value from its international projects.
Duke Energy currently owns and may acquire and/or dispose of material energy-related investments and projects outside the U.S. The economic, regulatory, market and political conditions in some of the countries where Duke Energy has interests may impact its ability to obtain financing on suitable terms. Other risks relate to its customers ability to honor their obligations with respect to projects and investments, delays in construction, limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights, and interruption of business, as well as risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law, regulations, market rules or tax policy.
Operational Risks The Duke Energy Registrants results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market, economic and other conditions that are beyond their control.
Sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate and negatively influence electricity operations. Declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns in the Duke Energy Registrants regulated electric service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity. Although the Duke Energy Registrants regulated electric business is subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs, such as fuel, under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values.
The Duke Energy Registrants also sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power markets on a contractual basis. With respect to such transactions, the Duke Energy Registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investments through mandated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices. These market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and could reduce the Duke Energy Registrants revenues and margins, thereby diminishing results of operations.
Factors that could impact sales volumes, generation of electricity and market prices at which the Duke Energy Registrants are able to sell electricity are as follows:  weather conditions, including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy usage for heating or cooling purposes, respectively, and periods of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facilities in an economical manner;  supply of and demand for energy commodities;  transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies that impact nonregulated energy operations;  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, which are preferred by some customers over electricity produced from coal, nuclear or gas plants, and customer usage of energy-efficient equipment that reduces energy demand;  natural gas, crude oil and refined products production levels and prices;  ability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory, such as coal, gas and uranium; and  capacity and transmission service into, or out of, the Duke Energy Registrants markets.
Natural disasters or operational accidents may adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants operating results.
Natural disasters (such as electromagnetic events or the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan) or other operational accidents within the industry (such as the San Bruno, California natural gas transmission pipeline failure) could have direct significant impacts on the Duke Energy Registrants as well as on key contractors and suppliers. Such events could indirectly impact the Duke Energy Registrants through changes to policies, laws and regulations whose compliance costs have a significant impact on the Duke Energy Registrants financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The Duke Energy Registrants financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand or number of customers.
Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants, such as mandated energy-efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.
Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.
Advances in distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines, and solar cells, may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the Duke Energy Registrants.
21 PART I Some or all of these factors, could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers, and may cause the failure of the Duke Energy Registrants to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Furthermore, the Duke Energy Registrants currently have energy-efficiency riders in place to recover the cost of energy-efficiency programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio and Kentucky. Should the Duke Energy Registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact.
The Duke Energy Registrants operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather.
Electric power generation is generally a seasonal business. In most parts of the U.S., and other markets in which Duke Energy operates, demand for power peaks during the warmer summer months, with market prices typically peaking at that time. In other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. Further, extreme weather conditions such as heat waves or winter storms could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. As a result, in the future, the overall operating results of the Duke Energy Registrants businesses may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period-to-period comparison less relevant.
Sustained severe drought conditions could impact generation by hydroelectric plants, as well as fossil and nuclear plant operations, as these facilities use water for cooling purposes and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment. Furthermore, destruction caused by severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, can result in lost operating revenues due to outages; property damage, including downed transmission and distribution lines; and additional and unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage. The cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.
The Duke Energy Registrants sales may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission assets.
The Duke Energy Registrants depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market. FERCs power transmission regulations, as well as those of Duke Energys international markets, require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. If transmission is disrupted, or if transmission capacity is inadequate, the Duke Energy Registrants ability to sell and deliver products may be hindered.
The different regional power markets have changing regulatory structures, which could affect growth and performance in these regions. In addition, the ISOs who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed in the past, and may impose in the future, price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. These types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the Duke Energy Registrants wholesale power marketing business.
Fluctuations in commodity prices or availability may adversely affect various aspects of the Duke Energy Registrants operations as well as their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal, fuel oil, nuclear fuel, electricity and other energy-related commodities as a result of their ownership of energy-related assets. Fuel costs are recovered primarily through cost-recovery clauses, subject to the approval of state utility commissions.
Additionally, the Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligations. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the Duke Energy Registrants to operate their facilities. Should counterparties fail to perform, the Duke Energy Registrants might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market prices possibly resulting in losses in addition to the amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties.
Certain of the Duke Energy Registrants hedge agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, derivative collateral with counterparties, depending on the daily derivative position. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the return of collateral received and/or the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity. Downgrades in the Duke Energy Registrants credit ratings could lead to additional collateral posting requirements. The Duke Energy Registrants continually monitor derivative positions in relation to market price activity.
Potential terrorist activities or military or other actions, including cyber attacks and data security breaches, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants businesses.
The continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the U.S. and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, which may have material adverse effects in ways the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict at this time. In addition, future acts of terrorism and possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the U.S. and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the U.S. or their international affiliates. Information technology systems, infrastructure and generation facilities such as nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups. The potential for terrorism has subjected the Duke Energy Registrants operations to increased risks and could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. In particular, the Duke Energy Registrants may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for their cyber systems and plants, including nuclear power plants under the NRCs design basis threat requirements. These increased costs could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident.
Information security risks have generally increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyber attacks and data security breaches. The utility industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid. Additionally, connectivity to the Internet continues to increase through smart grid and other initiatives. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure, increased connectivity to the Internet and technology systems inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism or other types of data security breaches, the Duke Energy Registrants face a heightened risk of cyber attack. In the event of such an attack, the Duke Energy Registrants could (i) have business operations disrupted, property damaged, customer information stolen and other 22 PART I private information accessed (ii) experience substantial loss of revenues, repair and restoration costs, implementation costs for additional security measures to avert future cyber attacks and other financial loss, and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation and reputational damage.
Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations.
Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their financial position or results of operations could be negatively affected.
Duke Energys investments and projects located outside of the U.S. expose it to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates. These risks, and Duke Energys activities to mitigate such risks, may adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations.
Duke Energys operations and investments outside the U.S. expose it to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates. As each local currencys value changes relative to the U.S. dollar, the value in U.S. dollars of Duke Energys assets and liabilities in such locality and the cash flows generated in such locality, expressed in U.S. dollars, also change. Duke Energys primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the Brazilian Real.
Duke Energy selectively mitigates some risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations by, among other things, indexing contracts to the U.S. dollar and/or local inflation rates, hedging through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency and hedging through foreign currency derivatives. These efforts, however, may not be effective and, in some cases, may expose Duke Energy to other risks that could negatively affect its cash flows and results of operations.
The costs of retiring Duke Energy Floridas Crystal River Unit 3 could prove to be more extensive than is currently identified.
Exit costs to wind down operations and ultimately to retire and decommission the plant could exceed estimates and, if not recoverable through the regulatory process, could adversely affect Duke Energys, Progress Energys and Duke Energy Floridas financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Duke Energy Ohios and Duke Energy Indianas membership in an RTO presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
The price at which Duke Energy Ohio can sell its generation capacity and energy is dependent on a number of factors, which include the overall supply and demand of generation and load, other state legislation or regulation, transmission congestion, and its business rules. As a result, the prices in dayahead and realtime energy markets and RTO capacity markets are subject to price volatility. Administrative costs imposed by RTOs, including the cost of administering energy markets, are also subject to volatility. PJM conducts Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) base residual auctions for capacity on an annual planning year basis. The results of the PJM RPM base residual auction are impacted by the supply and demand of generation and load and also may be impacted by congestion and PJM rules relating to bidding for Demand Response and Energy Efficiency resources. Auction prices could fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of future auctions, but if the auction prices are sustained at low levels, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
The rules governing the various regional power markets may also change, which could affect Duke Energy Ohios and Duke Energy Indianas costs and/or revenues. To the degree Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana incur significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an RTO, their results of operations may be impacted. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be allocated a portion of the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in RTO transmission rate design. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decisions made by an RTO rather than their own internal planning process. While RTO transmission rates were initially designed to be revenue neutral, various proposals and proceedings currently taking place by the FERC may cause transmission rates to change from time to time. In addition, RTOs has been developing rules associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana.
As a members of an RTO, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are subject to certain additional risks, including those associated with the allocation among RTO members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in the RTO markets and those associated with complaint cases filed against an RTO that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by RTO members.
Nuclear Generation Risks Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida may incur substantial costs and liabilities due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facilities.
Ownership interest in and operation of nuclear stations by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida subject them to various risks. These risks include, among other things: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.
Ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires compliance with licensing and safety-related requirements imposed by the NRC. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, and/or shut down a unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the NRC, which could be prompted by, 23 PART I among other things, events within or outside of the control of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a third party, could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures, as well as assessments to cover third-party losses. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida.
Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock Risks The Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term borrowings and longer-term capital markets to finance their capital requirements and support their liquidity needs. Access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions, many of which are beyond the Duke Energy Registrants control.
The Duke Energy Registrants businesses are financed to a large degree through debt. The maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from their assets. Accordingly, as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with disparate maturities, the Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term money markets as well as longer-term capital markets. The Subsidiary Registrants also rely on access to short-term intercompany borrowings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are not able to access capital at competitive rates or at all, the ability to finance their operations and implement their strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected. An inability to access capital may limit the Duke Energy Registrants ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that they may otherwise rely on for future growth.
Market disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include: economic downturns, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company, capital market conditions generally, market prices for electricity and gas, terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on their facilities or unrelated energy companies, or the overall health of the energy industry. The availability of credit under Duke Energys revolving credit facilities depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under such facilities to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise. Systematic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its obligations under the facility agreement.
Duke Energy maintains a revolving credit facility to provide back-up for its commercial paper program and letters of credit to support variable rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrant issuer at the option of the holder. The facility includes borrowing sublimits for the Duke Energy Registrants, each of whom is a party to the credit facility, and financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity. Failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude Duke Energy from issuing commercial paper or the Duke Energy Registrants from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the revolving credit facility.
The Duke Energy Registrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit ratings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings, they would be required under credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may materially adversely affect their liquidity.
Each of the Duke Energy Registrants senior long-term debt issuances is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot ensure their senior long-term debt will be rated investment grade in the future.
If the rating agencies were to rate the Duke Energy Registrants below investment grade, their borrowing costs would increase, perhaps significantly. In addition, their potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Further, if the short-term debt rating were to fall, access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited. A reduction in liquidity and borrowing availability could ultimately impact the ability to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of Duke Energys international operations, which could result in significant income taxes that would have a material effect on its results of operations.
A downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under various credit, commodity and capacity agreements and trigger termination clauses in some interest rate derivative agreements, which would require cash payments. All of these events would likely reduce the Duke Energy Registrants liquidity and profitability and could have a material effect on their financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Non-compliance with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants ability to execute future borrowings.
The Duke Energy Registrants debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements.
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of the NDTF investments of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, which then could require significant additional funding.
Ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the respective nuclear power plants. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future obligations. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected rates of return. Although a number of factors impact funding requirements, a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for decommissioning nuclear plants. If Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are unable to successfully manage their NDTF assets, their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.
Poor investment performance of the Duke Energy pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants liquidity and results of operations.
The costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the 24 PART I cost and obligations related to these plans. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of plan assets and, depending upon the other factors impacting costs as listed above, Duke Energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations, and the Subsidiary Registrants proportionate share of such cash funding obligations, could have a material impact on the Duke Energy Registrants financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

26 PART I ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For information regarding legal proceedings, including regulatory and environmental matters, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies  Litigation and Commitments and Contingencies  Environmental.
Ash Basin Litigation North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources Enforcement Actions In the first quarter of 2013, environmental organizations sent notices of intent to sue to Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress related to alleged groundwater violations and Clean Water Act violations from coal ash ponds at two of their coal-fired power plants in North Carolina. The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) filed enforcement actions against Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress alleging violations of water discharge permits and North Carolina groundwater standards. The case against Duke Energy Carolinas was filed in Mecklenburg County Superior Court. The case against Duke Energy Progress was filed in Wake County Superior Court. On October 4, 2013, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and DENR negotiated a proposed consent order. The consent order assesses civil penalties (approximately $100,000 in the aggregate) and imposes a compliance schedule requiring Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to undertake monitoring and data collection activities toward making appropriate corrective action to address any substantiated violations. On February 10, 2014, DENR asked the court to postpone consideration of the consent order while DENR reviews Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progresss coal ash ponds in light of the release that occurred at Dan River on February 2, 2014. On February 20, 2014, DENR informed the court it will make a recommendation on the proposed consent order by March 21, 2014. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies  Litigation  Duke Energy Carolinas for additional information related to the Dan River release.
On August 16, 2013, the DENR filed an enforcement action against Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress related to their remaining plants in North Carolina, alleging violations of the Clean Water Act and violations of the North Carolina groundwater standards. The case against Duke Energy Carolinas was filed in Mecklenburg County Superior Court. The case against Duke Energy Progress was filed in Wake County Superior Court. Both of these cases have been assigned to the judge handling the enforcement actions discussed above. Catawba Riverkeeper Foundation, Inc. (Catawba Riverkeeper) moved to intervene in the Duke Energy Carolinas case. Southern Environmental Law Center, on behalf of several environmental groups, moved to intervene in the Duke Energy Progress case. On November 17, 2013, the court granted, in part, Catawba Riverkeepers and Southern Environmental Law Centers motions to intervene, allowing them full party status as to certain plants, but granting only permissive intervention for the remaining plants.
Catawba Riverkeeper Foundation, Inc. v. Duke Energy Carolinas On June 11, 2013, Catawba Riverkeeper filed a separate action in the United States Court for the Western District of North Carolina. The lawsuit contends the state enforcement action discussed above does not adequately address issues raised in its notice of intent to sue. On August 1, 2013, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a motion to dismiss this case in light of North Carolinas diligent prosecution in the state enforcement actions. Catawba Riverkeeper filed objections to the Magistrates recommendation of dismissal on December 18, 2013.
Cape Fear River Watch, Inc., Sierra Club, and Waterkeeper Alliance v. Duke Energy Progress On September 12, 2013, Cape Fear River Watch, Inc., Sierra Club, and Waterkeeper Alliance filed a citizen suit in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The lawsuit alleges unpermitted discharges to surface water and groundwater violations. Duke Energy Progress filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit on November 5, 2013.
For additional information, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies.
Avian Mortalities On November 22, 2013, Duke Energy entered into a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) related to the incidental deaths of golden eagles and other migratory birds resulting from turbine collisions at four wind farms in Wyoming.
Terms of the agreement include two misdemeanor violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, payment of $1 million in fines and restitution, five years probation, and implementation of a migratory bird compliance plan. The agreement includes a ten-year non-prosecution agreement for future incidental deaths at four facilities. Duke Energy undertakes adaptive management practices designed to avoid and minimize additional avian impacts.
Brazilian Transmission Fee Assessments On July 16, 2008, Duke Energy International Geracao Paranapanema S.A. (DEIGP) filed a lawsuit in the Brazilian federal court challenging transmission fee assessments imposed under two new resolutions promulgated by the Brazilian electricity regulatory agency (ANEEL) (collectively, the Resolutions). The Resolutions purport to impose additional transmission fees on generation companies located in the State of Sao Paulo for utilization of the electric transmission system. The fees were retroactive to July 1, 2004 and effective through June 30, 2009. The charges were based upon a flat-fee that failed to take into account the locational usage by each generator. DEIGP's additional assessment under these Resolutions amounts to approximately $57 million inclusive of interest through December 2013. Pending resolution of this dispute on the merits, DEIGP deposited the disputed portion of the assessment into a court-monitored escrow, and paid the undisputed portion to the distribution companies. In a decision published on October 2, 2013, the trial court affirmed an additional fine imposed by ANEEL on April 1, 2009 for DEIGPs failure to pay the disputed portion of the assessment. DEIGP appealed the trial courts ruling and deposited $10 million into a court-monitored escrow.
Brazilian Regulatory Citations In September 2007, the State Environmental Agency of Parana (IAP) assessed seven fines against DEIGP, totaling $15 million for failure to comply with reforestation measures allegedly required by state regulations in Brazil. On January 14, 2010, DEIGP received a notice that one of the fines was subsequently increased, on grounds that DEIGP is an alleged repeat offender; however, in 2012 the decision to increase the amount of that fine was reversed. DEIGP filed administrative appeals with respect to all the fines. Between 2009 and 2012, four of the fines, in 30 PART I the total amount of $9 million, were judged to be valid in the administrative courts. DEIGP challenged those administrative rulings in the Brazilian state courts, by filing judicial actions for annulment and also requested its payment obligations be enjoined pending resolution on the merits. In one of the four cases, the court granted DEIGPs request for injunction, and subsequently ruled on the merits in favor of DEIGP. The plaintiff filed an appeal. In two of the four cases, the court granted DEIGPs request for injunction, and a decision on the merit is pending. In the fourth case, DEIGPs request for injunction was denied; however, DEIGP was granted permission to deposit the total amount of the fine in the court registry and to suspend entry of the debt in the state tax liability roster.
Additionally, DEIGP was assessed three environmental fines by the Brazilian federal environmental enforcement agency, Brazil Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), totaling approximately $1 million for improper maintenance of existing reforested areas. DEIGP believes that it has properly maintained all reforested areas and has challenged these assessments.
Gibson Notice of Violations Pursuant to Notices of Violation dated June 23, 2011 and July 16, 2013, the EPA has asserted that, on several occasions between August 1, 2008 through March 31, 2013, Duke Energy Indianas Gibson steam station violated opacity limits contained in its Title V permit. Duke Energy Indiana expects to enter into a settlement agreement with the EPA in the first quarter of 2014, which would require payment of a civil penalty of $199,000.

34 PART II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S., as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment income, discussed below. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following combined Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is separately filed by Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. However, none of the registrants makes any representation as to information related solely to Duke Energy or the Subsidiary Registrants of Duke Energy other than itself.
DUKE ENERGY Duke Energy Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Duke Energy) is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, and Duke Energy Indiana, as well as in Latin America.
When discussing Duke Energys consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of the Subsidiary Registrants, which, along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.
Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011.
Executive Overview Merger with Progress Energy On July 2, 2012, Duke Energy merged with Progress Energy, with Duke Energy continuing as the surviving corporation, and Progress Energy becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, Progress Energys regulated utility subsidiaries, are now indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy. Duke Energys consolidated financial statements include Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida activity beginning July 2, 2012.
Immediately preceding the merger, Duke Energy completed a one-for-three reverse stock split with respect to the issued and outstanding shares of Duke Energy common stock. All share and per share amounts presented herein reflect the impact of the one-for-three reverse stock split.
For additional information on the details of this transaction including regulatory conditions and accounting implications, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses and Sales of Other Assets.
2013 Financial Results The following table summarizes adjusted earnings and net income attributable to Duke Energy for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
Years   Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (in millions, except per share amounts) Amount Per   diluted share Amount Per   diluted share Amount Per diluted   share Adjusted earnings (a) $ 3,071 $ 4.35 $ 2,483 $ 4.32 $ 1,943 $ 4.38 Net income attributable to Duke Energy 2,665 3.76 1,768 3.07 1,706 3.83 (a) See Results of Operations below for Duke Energys definition of   adjusted earnings as well as a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial   measure to net income attributable to Duke Energy.
Adjusted earnings increased from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of Progress Energy results in 2013, the impact of the revised rates, net of higher depreciation and amortization expense and lower allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). Adjusted earnings increased from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to the inclusion of Progress Energys results beginning July 2012, and the impact of the 2011 Duke Energy Carolinas rate cases.
See Results of Operations below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations, as well as a detailed discussion of financial results for each of Duke Energys reportable business segments, as well as Other.
2013 Areas of Focus and Accomplishments In 2013, Duke Energy was focused on completing the fleet modernization program, achieving constructive outcomes in its rate cases, resolving key issues  including the future Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear station, improving nuclear fleet performance, and realizing merger integration plans.
Completing the Fleet Modernization Program 35 PART II During 2013, Duke Energy completed its $9 billion fleet modernization program. This program added approximately 6,600 MWs of new combined-cycle natural gas and state-of-the-art coal capacity in North Carolina, South Carolina and Indiana. This new generation will replace up to 6,700 MW of older coal and oil plants, already retired or scheduled for retirement by 2015.
The Edwardsport IGCC and Sutton combined-cycle natural gas plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, were placed in commercial service in June and November, respectively.
At Edwardsport, Duke Energy has been testing, tuning and optimizing the unit.
All major technology systems have been validated. Performance testing was delayed in January by extreme weather, which also caused some equipment issues that are being resolved. The Edwardsport IGCC project is expected to achieve its full operational capabilities later this year and to be completed within the revised cost estimate of $3.5 billion .
Achieving Constructive Outcomes in Rate Cases Duke Energy reached constructive regulatory outcomes in all five of its general rate cases to recover investments made to modernize its fleet. When fully implemented, the base rate cases will add approximately $600 million in annualized revenues, while keeping customers retail priced below national averages.
Resolving Key Issues Duke Energy also made the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3, resolved insurance claims with its insurance provider, Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), and obtained approval from the FPSC of a comprehensive settlement.
This settlement agreement addressed cost recovery of the nuclear unit, Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units, and the proposed Levy Nuclear Station (Levy). The settlement agreement also provides for new generation in the latter half of this decade to meet customer demand.
Improving Nuclear Fleet Performance In 2013, Duke Energys nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.8 percent, the 15 th consecutive year with a capacity factor over 90 percent. Duke Energy has made targeted investments at nuclear stations to bring the entire fleet to consistent level of excellent performance. In particular, the Robinson Nuclear Station (Robinson) completed a record continuous run of 531 days before beginning a scheduled refueling outage in September. This complemented the record of continuous runs achieved at Oconee Nuclear Station Units 2 and Unit 3.
Realizing Merger Integration Plans Duke Energy expects to exceed its original targets for fuel and joint-dispatch savings, which benefit customers in the North Carolina and South Carolina. Through 2013, Duke Energy has recorded approximately $190 million of cumulative fuel and joint-dispatch savings since the merger closed. In addition, approximately 65 percent of the total guaranteed savings of $687 million have been contractually locked-in or generated.
Duke Energy is also realizing cost synergies by eliminating duplicative functions and has exceed the original target of five to seven percent in non-fuel operating and maintenance savings. Duke Energy is on pace to deliver about nine percent, or approximately $550 million, of non-fuel operating and maintenance expense in 2014.
2014 Objectives Duke Energy is dedicated to the energy experience that customers value and trust. Duke Energy strives for leadership and excellence that benefit customers, shareholders and employees. Objectives for 2014 are:  Continue to grow a zero-injury culture and deliver top-decile safety results,  Develop and engage employees,  Deliver new value by improving the customer experience and advancing more flexible regulatory models,  Establish a rigorous process for managing business and financial performance to deliver customer value at a competitive price,  Successfully complete 2014 integration milestones and continue innovative use of technology to deliver value,  Achieve 2014 financial goals, including delivering adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.45 -$4.60, and advance viable future growth opportunities for regulated and nonregulated businesses , and  Serve as a respected leading voice in helping to shape national and state energy policies.
Due to the forward-looking nature of the adjusted diluted EPS range, information to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as Duke Energy is unable to forecast all special items, the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment, or any amounts that may be reported as discontinued operations or extraordinary items for future periods.
Results of Operations In this section, Duke Energy provides analysis and discussion of earnings and factors affecting earnings on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
Management evaluates financial performance in part based on the non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS). These items are measured as income from continuing operations after deducting income attributable to noncontrolling interests, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items and mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment. Special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis, although it is reasonably possible such charges and credits could recur. Mark-to-market adjustments reflect the impact of derivative contracts, which are used in Duke Energys hedging of a portion of the economic value of its generation assets in the Commercial Power segment. The mark-to-market impact of derivative contracts is recognized in GAAP earnings immediately as such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory treatment. The economic value of generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of input and output commodities (e.g. coal, electricity, natural gas). Economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of those input and output commodities related to generation assets. Operations of the generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method. Management believes excluding impacts of mark-to-market changes of the derivative contracts from adjusted earnings until 36 PART II settlement better matches the financial impacts of the derivative contract with the portion of economic value of the underlying hedged asset. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energys performance across periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting and for reporting results to the Board of Directors, employees, shareholders, analysts and investors concerning Duke Energys financial performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are Net Income Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation and Diluted EPS attributable to Duke Energy Corporation common shareholders, which include the dollar and per share impact of special items, mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment and discontinued operations.
Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Segment income, as discussed below, includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Management also uses adjusted segment income as a measure of historical and anticipated future segment performance. Adjusted segment income is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it is based upon segment income adjusted for special items and mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment. Management believes the presentation of adjusted segment income provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of a segments performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted segment income is segment income, which represents segment income from continuing operations, including any special items and mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Power segment.
See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Business Segments, for a discussion of Duke Energys segment structure.

Partially offsetting these increases was:  Higher depreciation and amortization expense;  Lower AFUDC;  Lower nonregulated Midwest gas generation results; and  Incremental shares issued to complete the Progress Energy merger (impacts per diluted share amounts only).
The variance in adjusted earnings for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 2011, was primarily due to:  The inclusion of Progress Energy results beginning in July 2012; and  Increased retail pricing and riders primarily resulting from the implementation of revised rates in North Carolina and South Carolina for Duke Energy Carolinas.
Partially offsetting these increases was:  Unfavorable weather in 2012 compared to 2011;  Higher depreciation and amortization expense;  Lower nonregulated Midwest coal generation results; and  Incremental shares issued to complete the Progress Energy merger (impacts per diluted share amounts only).

The impacts of the   Interim FERC Mitigation are reflected in the Other segment, and are not   included in the operating results in the table above.
(b) Includes 904 and 577 GWh sales for the years ended December 31,   2013 and 2012, respectively, associated with the Interim FERC Mitigation. The   impacts of the Interim FERC Mitigation are reflected in the Other segment,   and are not included in the operating results in the table above.
(c) For Duke Energy Progress, all GWh sales for the year ended December   31, 2011, and 26,634 GWh sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, occurred   prior to the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy.
(d) For Duke Energy Florida, all GWh sales for the year ended   December 31, 2011, and 18,348 GWh sales for the year ended December 31, 2012,   occurred prior to the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy.
Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012 Regulated Utilities results were positively impacted by 2012 impairment and other charges related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant, higher retail pricing and rate riders, the inclusion of Progress Energy results for the first six months of 2013, a net increase in wholesale power revenues, and higher weather normal sales volumes. These impacts were partially offset by higher income tax expense, Crystal River Unit 3 38 PART II charges, lower AFUDC equity and higher depreciation and amortization expense. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
Operating Revenues.
The variance was driven primarily by:  A $4,339 million increase due to the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013,  A $434 million net increase in retail pricing primarily due to revised rates approved in all jurisdictions;  A $76 million net increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing, primarily due to additional volumes and charges for capacity for customers served under long-term contracts; and  A $72 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers (net of fuel revenue) reflecting increased demand.
Partially offset by:  A $132 million decrease in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven primarily by (i) the impact of lower Florida residential fuel rates, including amortization associated with the settlement agreement approved by the FPSC in 2012 (2012 Settlement), (ii) lower fuel rates for electric retail customers in the Carolinas, Florida and Ohio, and (iii) lower revenues for purchased power, partially offset by (iv) increased demand from electric retail customers. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers.
Operating Expenses.
The variance was driven primarily by:  A $3,393 million increase due to the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013,  A $346 million increase in impairment and other charges in 2013 primarily related to Crystal River Unit 3 and Levy. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters, for additional information, and  A $102 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to a decrease in the reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization expense as allowed under the 2012 Settlement.
Partially offset by:  A $600 million decrease due to 2012 impairment and other charges related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for additional information, and  A $120 million decrease in fuel expense (including purchased power and natural gas purchases for resale) primarily related to (i) the application of the NEIL settlement proceeds in Florida, including amortization associated with the 2012 Settlement; (ii) lower purchased power costs in (a) the Carolinas, primarily due to additional generating capacity placed in service in late 2012 and market conditions, (b) Ohio, primarily due to reduced sales volumes, and (c) Indiana, reflective of market conditions; partially offset by (iii) higher volumes of natural gas used in electric generation due primarily to additional generating capacity placed in service; (iv) higher prices for natural gas and coal used in electric generation; and (v) higher volumes of coal used in electric generation primarily due to generation mix.
Other Income and Expenses, net.
The decrease is primarily due to lower AFUDC equity, resulting from major projects that were placed into service in late 2012 and the implementation of new customer rates related to the IGCC rider, partially offset by the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013.
Interest Expense.
The variance was primarily driven by the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013.
Income Tax Expense.
The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 37.8 percent and 35 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in pretax income and a reduction in AFUDC equity.
Year Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to 2011 Regulated Utilities results were positively impacted by the inclusion of Progress Energy results beginning in July 2012, higher net retail pricing and rate riders and decreased operating and maintenance expenses. These impacts were partially offset by additional charges related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant, unfavorable weather, and increased depreciation and amortization.
Operating Revenues.
The variance was driven primarily by:  A $4,918 million increase in operating revenues due to the inclusion of Progress Energy beginning in July 2012;  A $352 million net increase in retail pricing and rate riders primarily due to revised retail rates resulting from the 2011 North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases implemented in the first quarter of 2012, and revenues recognized for energy efficiency programs; and  A $293 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) driven primarily by higher revenues in Ohio for purchases of power as a result of the Ohio Electric Stabilization Plan (ESP), higher fuel rates for electric retail customers in all jurisdictions, and higher revenues for purchases of power in Indiana and the Carolinas, partially offset by decreased demand from electric retail customers in 2012 mainly due to unfavorable weather conditions, and lower demand and fuel rates in Ohio and Kentucky from natural gas retail customers. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers.
Partially offset by:  A $155 million decrease in electric and gas sales (net of fuel) to retail customers due to unfavorable weather conditions in 2012 compared to 2011. For the Carolinas, weather statistics for cooling degree days in 2012 were less favorable compared to 2011, while 39 PART II cooling degree days in Ohio and Indiana were favorable in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. For the Carolinas, Ohio and Indiana, weather statistics for heating degree days in 2012 were unfavorable compared to 2011.

(Ibener) in 2012 and higher average prices and lower purchased power costs in Brazil. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
Operating Revenues.
The variance was driven primarily by:  A $67 million decrease in Brazil due to weakening of the Real to the U.S. dollar,  A $53 million decrease in Central America due to lower average prices and volumes, and  An $18 million decrease in Argentina as a result of unfavorable exchange rates.
40 PART II Partially offset by:  A $67 million increase in Brazil due to higher average prices, net of lower volumes, and  A $65 million increase in Chile as a result of asset acquisitions in 2012.
Operating Expenses.
The variance was driven primarily by:  A $65 million decrease in Central America due to lower fuel costs, partially offset by higher purchased power and coal consumption, and  A $20 million decrease in Brazil due to weakening of the Real to the U.S. dollar and lower purchased power partially offset by higher variable costs.
Partially offset by:  A $36 million increase in Chile as a result of acquisitions in 2012.
Other Income and Expenses, net.
The decrease was primarily driven by a net currency remeasurement loss in Latin America due to strengthening of the dollar, and lower equity earnings at NMC as a result of lower MTBE average prices and lower volumes due to extended maintenance, partially offset by lower butane costs.
Interest Expense.
The variance was primarily due to the Chile acquisitions in 2012, partially offset by favorable exchange rates and lower inflation in Brazil.
Income Tax Expense.
The variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 28.3 percent and 24.8 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in countries with higher tax rates.
Year Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to 2011 International Energys results were negatively impacted by unfavorable exchange rates in Brazil, a 2011 Peru arbitration award, and lower margins in Central America, partially offset by higher average prices and volumes in Brazil and higher average prices in Peru. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
Operating Revenues.
The variance was driven primarily by:  A $53 million increase in Central America as a result of higher volumes due to a full year of commercial operations of the Las Palmas II plant and favorable hydrology,  A $24 million increase in Peru due to higher average prices, and  A $10 million increase in Argentina due to higher volumes as a result of favorable hydrology, partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates.
Operating Expenses.
The variance was driven primarily by:  A $76 million increase in Central America due to higher fuel costs and consumption as a result of increased dispatch.
Other Income and Expense, net.
The variance was primarily driven by the absence of a $20 million arbitration award in Peru.
Interest Expense.
The variance was primarily due to lower capitalized interest in Central America and Brazil, as well as higher inflation partially offset by favorable exchange rates in Brazil.
Income Tax Expense.
The variance in tax expense is primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 24.8 percent and 28.9 percent, respectively.
Commercial Power Years   Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 Variance   2013 vs. 2012 2011 Variance   2012 vs. 2011 Operating Revenues $ 2,145 $ 2,078 $ 67 $ 2,491 $ (413) Operating Expenses 2,178 1,981 197 2,300 (319) (Losses) Gains on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net (23) 8 (31) 15 (7) Operating (Loss) Income (56) 105 (161) 206 (101) Other Income and Expense, net 13 39 (26) 21 18 Interest Expense 64 63 1 87 (24) (Loss) Income Before Income Taxes (107) 81 (188) 140 (59) Income Tax Benefit (104) (7) (97) (2) (5) Less: Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests  1 (1) 8 (7) Segment (Loss) Income $ (3) $ 87 $ (90) $ 134 $ (47) Coal-fired plant production, GWh 18,467 16,164 2,303 17,378 (1,214) Gas-fired plant production, GWh 15,052 17,122 (2,070) 12,021 5,101 Renewable plant production, GWh 5,111 3,452 1,659 3,132 320 Total Commercial Power   production, GWh 38,630 36,738 1,892 32,531 4,207 Net proportional MW capacity in operation 7,915 8,094 (179) 8,325 (231) 41 PART II Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012 Commercial Powers results were negatively impacted by lower PJM capacity revenues and lower income from the renewables portfolio and gas-fired generation assets. These impacts are partially offset by higher income tax benefits and higher income from the coal-fired generation assets. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
Operating Revenues.
The variance was driven primarily by:  A $102 million increase in net mark-to-market revenues on non-qualifying power and capacity hedge contracts, consisting of mark-to-market gains of $96 million in 2013 compared to losses of $6 million in 2012;  A $68 million increase for the gas-fired generation assets driven primarily by higher power prices, partially offset by decreased volumes; and  A $67 million increase due to higher volumes in the renewables portfolio.
Partially offset by:  An $85 million decrease in PJM capacity revenues related to lower average cleared capacity auction pricing; and  An $81 million decrease due primarily to the sale of non-core businesses in 2012.
Operating Expenses.
The variance was driven primarily by:  A $109 million increase in fuel expenses from the gas-fired generation assets driven by higher average natural gas prices per million British Thermal Units (MMBtu), partially offset by decreased natural gas volumes; and  A $96 million increase in net mark-to-market fuel expenses on non-qualifying fuel hedge contracts, consisting of mark-to-market losses of $99 million in 2013 compared to losses of $3 million in 2012.
(Losses) Gains on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net.
The variance is attributable to a loss recognized on the sale of certain renewable development projects in 2013 and a gain on the 2012 contribution of certain renewable assets to a joint venture.
Other Income and Expense, net.
The variance is primarily due to the sale of non-core businesses in 2012, lower interest income and lower equity earnings from the renewables portfolio.
Income Tax Benefit.
The variance was primarily due to a decrease in both pretax income and manufacturing deductions combined with higher production tax credits in 2013. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 97.2 percent and (9.5) percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the period was primarily due to a pretax loss in 2013 compared to pretax income in 2012.
Year Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to 2011 Commercial Powers results were negatively impacted by the net impact of the expiration of the 2009-2011 ESP and the impact of competitive market dispatch for the coal-fired assets, lower Duke Energy Retail earnings, and lower PJM capacity revenues. These impacts were partially offset by lower operating expenses, lower impairment charges, and increased margins from the gas-fired generation assets. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
Operating Revenues.
The variance was driven primarily by:  A $285 million decrease for the coal-fired generation assets driven primarily by the expiration of the 2009-2011 ESP, net of stability charge revenues under the 2012-2014 ESP, partially offset by participating in the PJM wholesale energy market in 2012;  A $116 million decrease for Duke Energy Retail resulting from lower volumes and unfavorable pricing;  A $39 million decrease for the gas-fired generation assets driven primarily by lower power prices, partially offset by increased volumes;  A $27 million decrease due primarily to the termination of certain non-core operations at the end of the first quarter of 2011 and a reduction of coal sales volumes as a result of lower natural gas prices;  An $18 million decrease in PJM capacity revenues related to lower average cleared capacity auction pricing in 2012 compared to 2011 for the gas-fired generation assets, net of an increase associated with the move of the coal-fired generation assets from Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) to PJM in 2012; and  An $8 million decrease in net mark-to-market revenues on non-qualifying power and capacity hedge contracts, consisting of mark-to-market losses of $6 million in 2012 compared to gains of $2 million in 2011.
Partially offset by:  A $64 million increase from participation in competitive retail load auctions; and  A $17 million increase from higher production in the renewables portfolio.
42 PART II Operating Expenses.
The variance was driven primarily by:  A $140 million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses resulting primarily from the prior year recognition of MISO exit fees; lower transmission costs, prior year station outages, and 2011 regulatory asset amortization expenses;  An $88 million decrease primarily from the 2011 impairment of excess emission allowances as a result of the EPAs issuance of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR);  An $85 million decrease in fuel expenses from the gas-fired generation assets driven by lower natural gas costs, partially offset by increased volumes;  A $19 million decrease in fuel used due primarily to the termination of certain non-core operations at the end of the first quarter of 2011 and from lower natural gas prices;  A $15 million decrease due to the receipt of funds in 2012 related to a previously written-off receivable associated with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy;  A $15 million decrease in purchased power to serve Duke Energy Retail customers; and  A $13 million decrease in fuel used for the coal-fired generation assets driven primarily by lower generation volumes.
Partially offset by:  A $54 million increase in purchased power to serve competitive retail load auctions.
Other Income and Expense, net.
The variance is primarily due to the sale of certain Duke Energy Generation Services, Inc. (DEGS) operations and higher equity earnings from the renewables portfolio.
Interest Expense.
The variance is primarily due to higher capitalized interest on wind construction projects.
Income Tax Benefit.
The variance in tax benefit is primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were (9.5) percent and (1.4) percent, respectively.
Matters Impacting Future Commercial Power Results On February 17, 2014, Commercial Power announced that it had initiated a process to exit its nonregulated Midwest generation business. Considering a marketing period of several months and potential regulatory approvals, Commercial Power expects to dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business by early to mid-2015. In the first quarter of 2014, Commercial Power will reclassify approximately $3.5 billion carrying value of its Midwest generation business to assets held for sale and expects to record an estimated pretax impairment charge of $1 billion to $2 billion to reduce the carrying value to estimated sales proceeds less cost to sell.
In 2013, a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision holding that Commercial Power is responsible for certain MVP costs, a type of Transmission Expansion Planning (MTEP) cost, approved by MISO prior to the date of Commercial Powers withdrawal. The initial decision will be reviewed by FERC. If FERC upholds the initial decision, Commercial Power intends to file an appeal in federal court. If Commercial Power ultimately is found to be responsible for these costs, a portion of these costs may not be eligible for recovery, resulting in an adverse impact to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters, for additional information.
Changes or variability in assumptions used in calculating fair value of the renewables reporting unit for goodwill testing purposes including but not limited to, legislative actions related to tax credit extensions, long-term growth rates and discount rates, could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the renewables reporting unit. In the event of a significant decline in the estimated fair value of the renewables reporting unit, goodwill and other asset impairment charges could be recorded. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets associated with proposed renewable projects within Commercial Powers renewables reporting unit was approximately $84 million at December 31, 2013. In addition, management periodically reviews individual projects within Commercial Powers renewables portfolio to evaluate ongoing alignment with the strategic direction of the business.A determination that a project is no longer consistent with the business strategy and a decision to divest of a project or projects could result in an impairment charge.
Other Years   Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 Variance   2013 vs. 2012 2011 Variance   2012 vs. 2011 Operating Revenues $ 163 $ 74 $ 89 $ 44 $ 30 Operating Expenses 461 704 (243) 133 571 (Losses) Gains on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net (3) (7) 4 (8) 1 Operating Loss (301) (637) 336 (97) (540) Other Income and Expense, net 131 16 115 49 (33) Interest Expense 417 297 120 157 140 Loss Before Income Taxes (587) (918) 331 (205) (713) Income Tax Benefit (323) (378) 55 (114) (264) Less: Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests (3) (2) (1) (15) 13 Net Expense $ (261) $ (538) $ 277 $ (76) $ (462) 43 PART II Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012 Others results were positively impacted by lower charges related to the Progress Energy merger, the sale of DukeNet, and increased current year activity from mitigation sales related to the Progress Energy merger. These impacts were partially offset by increased interest expense, lower income tax benefit and the Crescent Resources LLC (Crescent) litigation reserve in 2013. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
Operating Revenues.
The variance was driven primarily by increased activity from mitigation sales related to the Progress Energy merger and higher premiums earned at Bison as a result of the addition of Progress Energy.
Operating Expenses.
The variance was driven primarily by lower charges related to the Progress Energy merger, and prior year donations, partially offset by the Crescent litigation reserve in 2013 and unfavorable loss experience at Bison as a result of the addition of Progress Energy.
Other Income and Expense , net.
The variance was driven primarily by a gain on the sale of Duke Energys 50 percent ownership in DukeNet in 2013.
Interest Expense.
The variance was due primarily to the inclusion of Progress Energy for the first six months of 2013 and additional debt issuances.
Income Tax Benefit.
The variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 55.1 percent and 41.1 percent, respectively.
Year Ended December 31, 2012 as Compared to 2011 Others results were negatively impacted by charges related to the Progress Energy merger and higher interest expense. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher income tax benefit due to increased net expense and higher returns on investments that support benefit obligations. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.
Operating Revenues.
The variance was driven primarily by higher premiums earned at Bison as a result of the addition of Progress Energy and mark-to-market activity at Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC (DETM).
Operating Expenses.
The variance was driven primarily by charges related to the Progress Energy merger and higher current year donations. These negative impacts were partially offset by lower JV costs related to DETM.
Other Income and Expense , net.
The variance was driven primarily by current year impairments and prior year gains on sales of investments, higher interest income recorded in 2011 following the resolution of certain income tax matters related to prior years and reversal of reserves related to certain guarantees Duke Energy had issued on behalf of Crescent in 2011. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher returns on investments that support benefit obligations.
Interest Expense.
The variance was due primarily to higher debt balances as a result of debt issuances and the inclusion of Progress Energy interest expense beginning in July 2012.
Income Tax Benefit.
The variance is primarily due to an increase in pretax loss. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 41.1 percent and 56.0 percent, respectively.
Matters Impacting Future Other Results Duke Energy previously held an effective 50 percent interest in Crescent. Crescent was a real estate joint venture formed by Duke Energy in 2006 that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 2009. On June 9, 2010, Crescent restructured and emerged from bankruptcy and Duke Energy forfeited its entire 50 percent ownership interest to Crescent debt holders. This forfeiture caused Duke Energy to recognize a loss, for tax purposes, on its interest in the second quarter of 2010. Although Crescent has reorganized and emerged from bankruptcy with creditors owning all Crescent interest, there remains uncertainty as to the tax treatment associated with the restructuring. Based on this uncertainty, it is possible that Duke Energy could incur a future tax liability related to the tax losses associated with its partnership interest in Crescent and the resolution of issues associated with Crescents emergence from bankruptcy.
44 PART II DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS Introduction Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011.

The variance was primarily due to:  A $104 million increase in fuel revenues driven primarily by higher natural gas prices and increased sales volumes. Fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers;  A $98 million increase in retail rates in North Carolina and South Carolina;  A $44 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail customers primarily due to higher demand; and  A $32 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing, primarily due to a new customer in 2013, increased capacity charges, and additional volumes for customers served under long-term contracts.
Operating Expenses.
The variance was primarily due to :  A $111 million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower costs associated with the Progress Energy merger, decreased corporate costs, lower outage and non-outage costs at generation plants and the levelization of nuclear outage costs, partially offset by the establishment of regulatory assets in the first quarter of 2012, pursuant to regulatory orders for future recovery of certain employee severance costs related to the 2010 voluntary severance plan and other costs; and  A $31 million decrease in impairment charges related to the merger with Progress Energy. These charges relate to planned transmission project costs for which recovery is not expected, and certain costs associated with mitigation sales pursuant to merger settlement agreements with the FERC.
Partially offset by:  A $118 million increase in fuel expense (including purchased power) primarily related to higher sales volumes and increased prices of natural gas used in electric generation, net of change in fuel mix, partially offset by decreased purchased power due to additional generating capacity placed in service late 2012.
Gains on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net.
The variance is due to recognition of gains on the sale of emissions allowances in 2012.
Other Income and Expense, net.
The variance is primarily due to lower earnings from AFUDC equity, resulting from major projects placed into service in late 2012, partially offset by higher deferred returns on completed projects prior to their inclusion in customer rates.
45 PART II Interest Expense.
The variance is primarily due to deferrals of debt costs on completed projects prior to their inclusion in customer rates in September 2013, partially offset by lower AFUDC debt due primarily to certain major projects that were placed into service in late 2012.
Income Tax Expense .
The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax book income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 37.8 percent and 34.3 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of lower AFUDC equity.
Matters Impacting Future Duke Energy Carolinas Results Appeals of recently approved rate cases are pending at the North Carolina Supreme Court. The NCAG and NC WARN dispute the rate of return, capital structure and other matters approved by the NCUC. The outcome of these appeals could have an adverse impact to Duke Energy Carolinas financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters, for additional information.
On February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke Energy Carolinas retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe stopping the release of materials into the river.

The variance was primarily due to:  A $167 million increase in base revenues at Duke Energy Florida as allowed by the 2012 Settlement;  A $136 million increase in wholesale sales at Duke Energy Progress (excluding fuel revenues) primarily due to a new customer contract that began in January 2013, an amended capacity contract that began in May 2012 and favorable weather conditions;  A $117 million increase at Duke Energy Progress due to revised rates in North Carolina;  A $57 million increase in nuclear cost-recovery clause revenues at Duke Energy Florida primarily due to an increase in recovery rates related to the Crystal River Unit 3 uprate project, prior period true-ups, and Levy as allowed by the 2012 Settlement; and  A $24 million increase (net of fuel revenue) in GWh sales to retail customers at Duke Energy Progress due to higher weather normal sales volumes to retail customers.
Partially offset by:  A $387 million decrease in retail fuel revenues at Duke Energy Florida primarily due to the impact of lower residential fuel rates and a decrease in GWh retail sales due to weather and lower usage.
Operating Expenses.
The variance was primarily due to:  A $482 million decrease in retail fuel expense at Duke Energy Florida primarily due to the application of the NEIL settlement proceeds including amortization associated with the 2012 Settlement, lower system requirements, and the prior year establishment of a regulatory liability for replacement power in accordance with the 2012 Settlement;  A $136 million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses at Duke Energy Progress primarily due to lower costs associated with the merger with Duke Energy and the levelization of nuclear outage costs;  A $71 million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses at Duke Energy Florida primarily due to the deferral of Crystal River Unit 3-related expenses, in accordance with the 2012 Settlement, lower costs associated with the merger with Duke Energy, and the prior year write-off of previously deferred costs related to the vendor not selected costs for the Crystal River Unit 3 containment repair. These were partially offset by the prior year reversal of accruals in conjunction with the placement of Crystal River Unit 3 into extended cold shutdown in accordance with the 2012 Settlement and higher charges associated with related settlement matters; and  A $32 million decrease in impairment charges at Duke Energy Progress related to the merger with Duke Energy. These charges relate to planned transmission project costs for which recovery is not expected, and certain costs associated with mitigation sales pursuant to merger settlement agreements with the FERC, partially offset by a current year impairment charge resulting from the decision to suspend the application for two proposed nuclear units at Harris.
Partially offset by: 47 PART II  A $212 million increase in impairment and other charges at Duke Energy Florida. In 2013, Duke Energy Florida recorded charges primarily related to Crystal River Unit 3 and Levy. In 2012, Duke Energy Florida recorded impairment and other charges related to the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters, for additional information; and  A $138 million increase in depreciation and amortization at Duke Energy Florida primarily due to higher nuclear cost-recovery amortization related to Levy and a decrease in the reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization expense as allowed under the 2012 Settlement.
Other Income and Expenses, net .
The variance was primarily due to lower AFUDC equity resulting from to major projects placed in service in late 2012 and the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3.
Interest Expense.
The variance was primarily due to the deferral of debt costs recorded on the retail portion of the retired Crystal River Unit 3 assets, partially offset by the charge to interest expense on the redemption of Progress Energys 7.10% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (QUIPS) in January 2013.
Income Tax Expense from Continuing Operations.
The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 36.2 percent and 32.7 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of lower AFUDC equity and the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) dividend deduction being recorded at Duke Energy in 2012.
Discontinued Operations, net of tax.
The variance was primarily due to the impact of the U.S. Global, LLC (Global) settlement in 2012. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information.
Matters Impacting Future Progress Energy Results An appeal of a recently approved rate case is pending at the North Carolina Supreme Court. The NCAG and NC WARN dispute the rate of return, capital structure and other matters approved by the NCUC. The outcome of this appeal could have an adverse impact to Progress Energys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters, for additional information.

The below percentages   for retail customer classes represent billed sales only. Total sales includes   billed and unbilled retail sales, and wholesale sales to incorporated   municipalities and to public and private utilities and power marketers.   Amounts are not weather normalized.
Increase (decrease) over prior year 2013 2012 Residential sales 4.0 % (8.2) % General service sales  % (1.8) % Industrial sales 1.1 % (1.0) % Wholesale power sales 7.6 % 25.9 % Total sales 3.1 % 3.9 % Average number of customers 0.9 % 0.8 % Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012 Operating Revenues.
The variance was primarily due to:  A $136 million increase in sales (excluding fuel revenues) to wholesale customers primarily due to a new customer contract that began in January 2013 and an amended capacity contract that began in May 2012;  A $117 million increase due to revised rates in North Carolina; and  A $24 million increase (net of fuel revenue) in GWh sales to retail customers due to higher weather normal sales volumes to retail customers.
Operating Expenses.
The variance was primarily due to:  A $136 million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower costs associated with the merger with Duke Energy and the levelization of nuclear outage costs; and  A $32 million decrease in impairment charges primarily related to the merger with Duke Energy. These charges relate to planned transmission projects for which recovery is not expected, and certain costs associated with mitigation sales pursuant to merger settlement agreements with the FERC. These charges were partially offset by a current year impairment charge resulting from the decision to suspend the application for two proposed nuclear units at Harris.
Partially offset by:  A $29 million increase in fuel expense (including purchased power) primarily due to higher non-recoverable purchased power costs and increased sales volumes, partially offset by lower fuel expense due to generation mix as a result of retiring certain coal-fired plants and adding one new natural gas-fired generating plant.
Other Income and Expense, net.
The variance was primarily due to lower AFUDC equity due to major projects that were placed into service in late 2012.
49 PART II Income Tax Expense.
The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 36.5 percent and 28.7 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of lower AFUDC equity.

The variance was primarily due to:  A $387 million decrease in retail fuel revenues primarily due to the impact of lower residential fuel rates and a decrease in GWh retail sales due to weather and lower usage.
Partially offset by:  A $167 million increase in base revenues as allowed by the 2012 Settlement, and  A $57 million increase in nuclear cost-recovery clause revenue due to an increase in recovery rates primarily related to the Crystal River Unit 3 uprate project, a prior period true-up and Levy as allowed by the 2012 Settlement.
Operating Expenses.
The variance was primarily due to:  A $482 million decrease in retail fuel expense primarily due to the application of the NEIL settlement proceeds including amortization associated with the 2012 Settlement, lower system requirements, and the prior year establishment of a regulatory liability for replacement power in accordance with the 2012 Settlement, and  A $71 million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to the deferral of Crystal River Unit 3-related expenses in accordance with the 2012 Settlement, lower costs associated with the merger with Duke Energy, and the prior year write-off of previously deferred costs related to the vendor not selected for the Crystal River Unit 3 containment repair. These were partially offset by the prior year reversal of accruals in conjunction with the placement of Crystal River Unit 3 into extended cold shutdown in accordance with the 2012 Settlement and higher charges associated with related settlement matters.
Partially offset by:  A $212 million increase in impairment and other charges. In 2013, Duke Energy Florida recorded impairment and other charges primarily related to Crystal River Unit 3 and Levy. In 2012, Duke Energy Florida recorded impairment and other charges related to the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters, for additional information; and 51 PART II  A $138 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to higher nuclear cost-recovery amortization related to Levy and a decrease in the reduction of the cost of removal component of amortization expense as allowed under the 2012 Settlement.
Other Income and Expense, net.
The variance was primarily due to lower AFUDC equity due primarily to the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3.
Interest Expense.
The variance was primarily due to the deferral of debt costs recorded on the retail portion of the retired Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset beginning January 1, 2013.
Income Tax Expense.
The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 39.6 percent and 35.7 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of lower AFUDC equity and lower impairment charges.

Partially offset by:  A $42 million decrease in regulated fuel expense driven primarily by lower purchased power expense and reduced volumes, partially offset by higher fuel costs.
53 PART II Other Income and Expenses, net.
The decrease was primarily due to lower AFUDC equity and lower interest income.
Interest Expense .
The decrease was primarily due to lower average debt balances in 2013 compared to 2012.
Income Tax Expense .
The variance was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 42.2 percent and 36 percent, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income and a decrease in the manufacturing deduction in 2013.
Matters Impacting Future Duke Energy Ohio Results On February 17, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio announced that it had initiated a process to exit its nonregulated Midwest generation business. Considering a marketing period of several months and potential regulatory approvals, Duke Energy Ohio expects to dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business by early to mid-2015. In the first quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Ohio will reclassify approximately $3.5 billion carrying value of its Midwest generation business to assets held for sale and expects to record an estimated pretax impairment charge of $1 billion to $2 billion to reduce the carrying value to estimated sales proceeds less cost to sell.
In 2013, a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision holding that Duke Energy Ohio is responsible for certain MVP costs, a type of MTEP cost, approved by MISO prior to the date of Duke Energy Ohios withdrawal. The initial decision will be reviewed by FERC. If FERC upholds the initial decision, Duke Energy Ohio intends to file an appeal in federal court. If Duke Energy Ohio ultimately is found to be responsible for these costs, a portion of these costs may not be eligible for recovery, resulting in an adverse impact to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters, for additional information.

Basis of Presentation The results of operations and variance discussion for Duke Energy Indiana is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K.
Results of Operations Years   Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 Variance Operating Revenues $ 2,926 $ 2,717 $ 209 Operating Expenses 2,193 2,792 (599) Operating Income (Loss) 733 (75) 808 Other Income and Expense, net 18 90 (72) Interest Expense 170 138 32 Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes 581 (123) 704 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 223 (73) 296 Net Income (Loss) $ 358 $ (50) $ 408 The following table shows the percent changes in GWh sales and   average number of customers for Duke Energy Indiana. The below percentages   for retail customer classes represent billed sales only. Total sales includes   billed and unbilled retail sales, and wholesale sales to incorporated   municipalities and to public and private utilities and power marketers.   Amounts are not weather normalized.
Increase (decrease) over prior year 2013 2012 Residential sales 3.2 % (4.8) % General service sales 0.5 % (0.5) % Industrial sales (0.3) % 1.7 % Wholesale power sales (1.4) % 7.9 % Total sales 0.4 % 1.2 % Average number of customers 0.7 % 0.6 % Year Ended December 31, 2013 as Compared to 2012 Operating Revenues.
The variance was primarily driven by:  A $155 million net increase primarily related to updates to the IGCC rider, and  A $43 million increase in fuel revenues (including emission allowances) due to an increase in fuel rates as a result of higher fuel and purchased power costs.
Operating Expenses.
The variance was primarily driven by:  A $600 million decrease due to 2012 impairment and other charges related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant, and  A $40 million decrease in depreciation expense due to a regulatory order related to the Edwardsport IGCC settlement agreement.
Partially offset by:  A $43 million increase in fuel costs primarily driven by higher fuel and purchased power costs.
Other Income and Expenses, net.
The variance was primarily driven by a $70 million decrease in AFUDC equity primarily due to updates to the IGCC rider in January 2013.
Interest Expense.
The variance was primarily driven by a $30 million decrease in AFUDC debt primarily due to updates to the IGCC rider in January 2013.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit).
The variance was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 38.4 percent and 59.5 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax was primarily due to pretax income in 2013 compared to pretax loss in 2012 primarily resulting from the Edwardsport IGCC project impairment and the impact of AFUDC equity in 2013 that reduced the tax expense compared to higher AFUDC in 2012 that increased the tax benefit.
55 PART II CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, judgments, assumptions and estimates that can significantly affect the reported results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. Judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs.
Management discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the audit committee of the Duke Energy board of directors. Management believes the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods.
Regulatory Accounting A substantial majority of Regulated Utilities, Duke Energys regulated operations, meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy records assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds, or reduce rates, to customers for previous collections or for costs that have yet to be incurred.
Management continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in Duke Energys jurisdictions, litigation of rate orders, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, recognition of nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of regulatory assets or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets. Total regulatory assets for Duke Energy were $10,086 million and $11,741 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Total regulatory liabilities were $6,265 million and $5,740 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For further information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters.
As required by regulated operations accounting, significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable cost is considered to be an entity specific cost recoverable in future rates and therefore a regulatory asset. Significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized are for entity specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred and are therefore a regulatory liability.
Regulatory accounting rules also require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost of a plant under construction (or a recently completed plant or an abandoned plant) will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. For example, if a cost cap is set, the amount of the disallowance is a result of a judgment as to the ultimate cost of the plant. Other disallowances can require judgments on allowed future rate recovery. As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters, during 2012 and 2011 Duke Energy Indiana recorded charges of $631 million and $222 million, respectively, related to the Edwardsport IGCC plant. In 2013, Duke Energy Florida recorded a charge of $295 million related to the retired Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Station. Also as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions and Sales of Other Assets, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recorded disallowance charges in 2012 in order to gain FERC approval of the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress guaranteed total fuel savings to customers in North Carolina and South Carolina of $687 million over the five years in order to gain NCUC and SCPSC approval of the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. Based on current estimates of future fuel costs, Duke Energy anticipates that it will meet the guaranteed fuel savings. However, if actual fuel costs are higher than expected, Duke Energy could record a charge for the unmet guaranteed savings.
Goodwill Impairment Assessments Duke Energys goodwill balances by segment are included in the following table.
December   31, (in millions) 2013 2012 Regulated Utilities $ 15,950 $ 15,950 International Energy 326 353 Commercial Power 64 62 Total Duke Energy goodwill $ 16,340 $ 16,365 During 2012, Duke Energy recorded $12,469 million of goodwill associated with the merger with Progress Energy. This goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date, and was allocated entirely to the Regulated Utilities segment. The remainder of Regulated Utilities goodwill relates to the acquisition of Cinergy in April 2006.
Duke Energy allocates goodwill to reporting units, which are a subset of the business segments and are determined based on how the segment is managed. Duke Energy is required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Duke Energy performs its annual impairment test as of August 31.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate 56 PART II regulation, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for Duke Energys business and the fair value of debt.
Estimated future cash flows under the income approach are based to a large extent on Duke Energys internal business plan, and adjusted as appropriate for Duke Energys views of market participant assumptions. Duke Energys internal business plan reflects managements assumptions related to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data obtained from third-party sources, projected commodity pricing data and potential changes in environmental regulations. The business plan assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of returns on equity, anticipated earnings/returns related to significant future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of service, the renewal of certain contracts and the future of renewable tax credits. Management also makes assumptions regarding operation, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events. In estimating cash flows, Duke Energy incorporates expected growth rates, regulatory and economic stability, the ability to renew contracts and other factors, into its revenue and expense forecasts.
One of the most significant assumptions that Duke Energy utilizes in determining the fair value of its reporting units under the income approach is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows. Management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. A major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on twenty-year U.S. Treasury bonds. In the 2013 impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company specific risk premiums. For example, Duke Energy Ohios transmission and distribution reporting unit generally would have a lower company specific risk premium as it does not have the higher level of risk associated with owning and operating generation assets nor does it have significant construction risk or risk associated with potential future carbon legislation or pending EPA regulations. The discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2013, for each of Duke Energys domestic reporting units ranged from 5.4 percent to 7.4 percent.
For Duke Energys international operations, a country specific risk adder based on the average risk premium for each separate country in which International Energy operates was added to the base discount rate to reflect the differing risk profiles. This resulted in a discount rate for the August 31, 2013 goodwill impairment test for the international operations of 10.6 percent.
The underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in managements estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges.
The majority of Duke Energys business is in environments that are either fully or partially rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energys regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, changes in discount rates may have a significant impact on the fair value of equity.
As of August 31, 2013, all of the reporting units estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity by more than 10 percent.
The fair value of Commercial Powers Renewables reporting unit is impacted by a multitude of factors, including legislative actions related to tax credit extensions, long-term growth rate assumptions, the market price of power and discount rates. As of December 31, 2013, the Renewables reporting units estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity. Duke Energy continues to monitor these assumptions for any indicators that the fair value of the reporting unit could be below the carrying value, and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate.
Long-Lived Asset Impairment Assessments Property, plant and equipment is stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value, if impaired. Duke Energy evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant change in cash flow projections, the determination that it is more likely than not an asset or asset group will be sold, or a regulating body with authority to set rates Duke Energy charges to customers approves an order disallowing recovery of costs incurred or to be incurred) indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with their carrying value, except when applied to regulated plant costs that are disallowed for ratemaking purposes. The impairment for a disallowance of costs for regulated plants under construction, recently completed or abandoned is based on discounted cash flows. See Regulatory Accounting for information related to accounting for rate regulated operations.
Performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the asset and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. Additionally, determining fair value of the asset requires probability weighting future cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less cost to sell to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.
When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has discrete cash flows. For regulated entities, the lowest level with discrete cash flows is generally the operating utility level.
When it becomes probable that regulated generation, transmission or distribution assets will be abandoned, the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service. The value that may be retained as an asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned property is dependent upon 57 PART II amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. As such, an impairment charge could be offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable.
As discussed further in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions, Dispositions, and Sales of Other Assets, in the first quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Ohio announced it had initiated a process to exit its nonregulated Midwest generation business. As a result, Duke Energy expects to classify the Midwest generation business as held for sale and record an estimated pretax impairment charge of $1billion to $2billion in the first quarter of 2014. As discussed further in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions, Dispositions, and Sales of Other Assets, in the third quarter of 2012, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recorded certain impairment charges in conjunction with the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. As discussed further in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the third quarter of 2011, Commercial Power recorded $79 million of pretax impairment charges related to CAA emission allowances that were no longer expected to be used as a result of the issuance of the final CSAPR. These impairment charges are recorded in Goodwill and Other Impairment Charges on Duke Energys Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Accounting for Loss Contingencies Preparation of financial statements and related disclosures require judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events. Duke Energy is involved in certain legal and environmental matters arising in the normal course of business. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts and scenarios that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties, such as federal, state and local courts and other regulators. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time. Amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual outcome once the contingency is resolved, which could have a material impact on future results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Duke Energy.
For further information, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies.
Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits The calculation of pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post-retirement assets or liabilities require the use of assumptions and election of permissible accounting alternatives. Changes in assumptions can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke Energy believes the most critical assumptions for pension and other post-retirement benefits are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Additionally, medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions are critical to Duke Energys estimates of other post-retirement benefits.
Duke Energy elects to amortize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan projected benefit obligation, into net pension or other post-retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active covered employees. Prior service cost or credit, which represents the effect on plan liabilities due to plan amendments, is amortized over the average remaining service period of active covered employees.
Duke Energy maintains non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. The plans cover most U.S. employees using a cash balance formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage of current eligible earnings based on age and years of service and current interest credits. Certain employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula.
Duke Energy provides some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non-contributory basis. Certain employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans.
For both pension and other post-retirement plans, Duke Energy assumes its plans assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent as of December 31, 2013. The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. U.S. equities are held for their high expected return. Non-U.S. equities, debt securities, hedge funds, real estate and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers on investments. In September 2013, Duke Energy adopted a de-risking investment strategy for its pension plan assets.As the funded status of the Duke Energy and Progress Energy pension plans increase, over time the allocation to return-seeking assets will be reduced and the allocation to fixed-income assets will be increased to better manage Duke Energys pension liability and reduce funded status volatility.Based on the current funded status of the plans, the asset allocation for the Duke Energy pension plans has been adjusted to 60 percent fixed-income assets and 40 percent return-seeking assets and the asset allocation for the Progress Energy pension plans has been adjusted to 55 percent fixed-income assets and 45 percent return-seeking assets.
The assets for Duke Energys pension and other post-retirement plans are maintained in a master trust. Duke Energy also invests other post-retirement assets in the Duke Energy Corporation Employee Benefits Trust (VEBA I). The investment objective of VEBA I is to achieve sufficient returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants. VEBA I is passively managed.
Duke Energy discounted its future U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a rate of 4.7 percent as of December 31, 2013. Discount rates used to measure benefit plan obligations for financial reporting purposes reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. As of December 31, 2013, Duke Energy determined its discount rate for U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to match the timing of projected benefit payments. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plans projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.
Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in Duke Energys pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities. Duke Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will 58 PART II be in the future. The following table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energys 2013 pretax pension expense, pension obligation and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 0.25 percent change in rates were to occur.

Duke Energys U.S. post-retirement plan uses a prescription drug trend rate, which reflects the near and long-term expectation of increases in prescription drug health care costs. As of December 31, 2013, the medical care trend rates were 8.5 percent, which grades to 5.00 percent by 2021.

59 PART II LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources and Uses of Cash Duke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its domestic liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energys capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. Duke Energys projected primary sources and uses for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below.
(in millions) 2014 2015 2016 Uses: Capital expenditures 5,825-6,125 6,850-7,450 7,175-8,175 Debt maturities (a) 2,170 2,470 1,870 Dividend payments 2,225 2,270 2,315 Sources: Cash flows from operations $ 7,370 $ 7,930 $ 8,150 Debt issuances 3,160 3,475 2,800 (a) Excludes capital leases and securitized receivables maturities   in 2016 expected to be renewed. Amount represents Duke Energy's financing   plan, which accelerates certain contractual maturities.
The Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. The companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt and Credit Facilities, for additional discussion of the money pool arrangement.
Duke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. Duke Energys current liabilities frequently exceed current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to the seasonality of its business.
Credit Facilities and Registration Statements Master Credit Facility Summary Duke Energy has a master credit facility with a capacity of $6 billion through December 2018. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy each have borrowing capacity under the master credit facility up to specified sublimits for each borrower. Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower. The amount available under the master credit facility has been reduced to backstop the issuances of commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder. The table below includes the current borrowing sublimits and available capacity under the master credit facility.
December 31, 2013 (in millions) Duke   Energy Duke   Energy (Parent) Duke   Energy Carolinas Duke   Energy Progress Duke   Energy Florida Duke   Energy Ohio Duke   Energy Indiana Facility size (a) $ 6,000 $ 2,250 $ 1,000 $ 750 $ 650 $ 650 $ 700 Reduction to backstop   issuances Notes payable and   commercial paper (b) (450)  (300)    (150) Outstanding letters of   credit (62) (55) (4) (2) (1)   Tax-exempt bonds (240)  (75)   (84) (81) Available capacity $ 5,248 $ 2,195 $ 621 $ 748 $ 649 $ 566 $ 469 (a) Represents the sublimit   of each borrower at December 31, 2013. The Duke Energy Ohio sublimit includes   $100 million for Duke Energy Kentucky.
(b) Duke Energy issued $450   million of commercial paper and loaned the proceeds through the money pool to   Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Indiana. The balances are classified as   long-term borrowings within Long-term Debt in Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke   Energy Indiana's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
PremierNotes Duke Energy has an effective Form S-3 with the SEC to sell up to $3 billion of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. The Form S-3 states that no more than $1.5 billion of the notes will be outstanding at any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Duke Energy or at the investors option at any time. The balance as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, was $836 million and $395 million, respectively. The notes are short-term debt obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as Notes payable and commercial paper on Duke Energys Consolidated Balance Sheets.
60 PART II Shelf Registration In September 2013, Duke Energy filed a Form S-3 with the SEC. Under this Form S-3, which is uncapped, the Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy may issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. The registration statement also allows for the issuance of common stock by Duke Energy.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Duke Energys projected capital and investment expenditures for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below.
(in millions) 2014 2015 2016 Regulated Utilities $ 4,850 $ 6,075 $ 6,500 Commercial Power, International Energy and Other 975 775 675 Total committed expenditures 5,825 6,850 7,175 Discretionary expenditures 300 600 1,000 Total projected capital and investment expenditures $ 6,125 $ 7,450 $ 8,175 Duke Energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning   its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest   business sectors. Based on this goal, the majority of Duke Energys total   projected capital expenditures are allocated to the Regulated Utilities   segment. The table below includes the components of projected capital   expenditures for Regulated Utilities for the next three fiscal years.
2014 2015 2016 New generation $ 200 $ 975 $ 1,175 Environmental 400 250 250 Nuclear fuel 525 525 575 Major nuclear 350 375 325 Customer additions 425 450 475 Grid modernization and other transmission and distribution   projects 125 450 525 Maintenance 2,825 3,050 3,175 Total projected Regulated Utilities capital and investment   expenditures $ 4,850 $ 6,075 $ 6,500 DEBT MATURITIES The following table shows the significant components of Current maturities of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Duke Energy Registrants currently anticipate satisfying these obligations, primarily with cash on hand and proceeds from additional borrowings.
(in millions) Maturity   Date Interest   Rate December   31, 2013 Unsecured Debt Duke Energy (Parent) February   2014 6.300 % $ 750 Progress Energy (Parent) March   2014 6.050 % 300 Duke Energy (Parent) September   2014 3.950 % 500 Tax-exempt Bonds Duke Energy Progress January   2014 0.105 % 167 Other 387 Current maturities of long-term debt $ 2,104 DIVIDEND PAYMENTS Duke Energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for 88 consecutive years and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. There is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.
Over the past several years, Duke Energys dividend has grown at approximately two percent annually, slower than overall earnings growth. The Board of Directors continues to target a payout ratio of 65 percent to 70 percent, based upon adjusted diluted EPS. Once the dividend is within the target payout ratio, Duke Energy believes it has the flexibility to grow the dividend at a pace more consistent with earnings growth.
Dividend and Other Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Regulatory Matters, Duke Energys wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy via dividend, advance or loan as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation which, in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock.
Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At December 31, 2013, the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend is less than 25 percent of Duke Energys consolidated net assets. Duke Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have any significant impact on Duke Energys ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations.
61 PART II CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES The relatively stable operating cash flows of Regulated Utilities compose a substantial portion of Duke Energys cash flows from operations. Regulated Utilities cash flows from operations are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas and costs of operations. Weather conditions, commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses, including unplanned plant outages and storms can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations. Duke Energy provides the liquidity support for Commercial Powers coal-fired and gas-fired assets that are dispatched into the PJM wholesale market. Commercial Power has economically hedged a portion of its forecasted generation through 2018 with various counterparties, and a substantial portion of these contracts require daily posting of margin, which can be significant. Duke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the master credit facility, to support these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information).
At December 31, 2013, Duke Energy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.5 billion, of which $1.1 billion is held by entities domiciled in foreign jurisdictions and is forecasted to be used to fund the operations of and investments in International Energy. Undistributed foreign earnings associated with International Energys operations are considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result, no U.S. tax is recorded on such earnings. This assertion is based on managements determination that the cash held in International Energys foreign jurisdictions is not needed to fund the operations of its U.S. operations and that International Energy either has invested or has intentions to reinvest such earnings. While management currently intends to indefinitely reinvest all of International Energys unremitted earnings, should circumstances change, Duke Energy may need to record additional income tax expense in the period in which such determination changes. The cumulative undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2013, on which Duke Energy has not provided deferred U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes is approximately $2.4 billion. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is estimated at between $300 million and $375 million. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Income Taxes, for additional information.
DEBT ISSUANCES Depending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt.
Duke Energys capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below. The 2014 projected capitalization percentages exclude purchase accounting adjustments related to the merger with Progress Energy.
Projected   2014 Actual   2013 Actual   2012 Equity 52 % 50 % 50 % Debt 48 % 50 % 50 % Duke Energys fixed charges coverage ratio, calculated using SEC guidelines, was 3.0 times for 2013, 2.5 times for 2012, and 3.2 times for 2011.
Restrictive Debt Covenants Duke Energys debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. The master credit facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65 percent for each borrower. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto. As of December31,2013, Duke Energy was in compliance with all covenants related to its significant debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.
Credit Ratings Duke Energy and certain subsidiaries each hold credit ratings by Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch), Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) and Standard & Poors Rating Services (S&P). Duke Energys corporate credit rating and issuer credit rating from Fitch, Moodys and S&P, respectively, as of February 13, 2013 is BBB+, A3 and BBB+, respectively. As of February13,2014, the Duke Energy Registrants have stable outlooks from Fitch, Moodys and S&P.
The following table includes the Duke Energy and certain subsidiaries Senior Unsecured Credit Ratings as of February13,2014.
S&P Moody's Fitch Duke Energy Corporation BBB A3 BBB+ Duke Energy Carolinas BBB+ A1 A Progress Energy BBB Baa1 BBB Duke Energy Progress BBB+ A1 A Duke Energy Florida BBB+ A3 A- Duke Energy Ohio BBB+ Baa1 A- Duke Energy Indiana BBB+ A2 A- Duke Energy Kentucky BBB+ Baa1 A- Credit ratings are dependent on the ability to meet our debt principal and interest obligations when they come due, which is a measure of the strength of the current balance sheet. If, as a result of market conditions or other factors, Duke Energy and certain other subsidiaries are unable to maintain current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted.
62 PART II Cash Flow Information The following table summarizes Duke Energys cash flows for the three most recently completed fiscal years.
Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Cash flows provided by   (used in): Operating activities $ 6,382 $ 5,244 $ 3,672 Investing activities (4,978) (6,197) (4,434) Financing activities (1,327) 267 1,202 Net increase (decrease)   in cash and cash equivalents 77 (686) 440 Cash and cash equivalents   at beginning of period 1,424 2,110 1,670 Cash and cash equivalents   at end of period $ 1,501 $ 1,424 $ 2,110 OPERATING CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes key components of Duke Energys   operating cash flows for the three most recently completed fiscal year.
Years   Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Net income $ 2,676 $ 1,782 $ 1,714 Non-cash adjustments to net income 4,876 3,769 2,628 Contributions to qualified pension plans (250) (304) (200) Working capital (920) (3) (470) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 6,382 $ 5,244 $ 3,672 For the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012, the   variance was driven primarily by:  A $2,001 million increase in net income after non-cash   adjustments, mainly due to the inclusion of Progress Energy's results for   first six months of 2013 and the impact of revised rates and lower operation   and maintenance expenses, partially offset by;  A $917 million decrease in operating cash flows from increased   investments in traditional working capital, mainly due to the timing of   receivables and accruals, lower incentive accruals, net of current year   payments and reserve reductions and the prior year overallocation of the   Carolinas' fuels costs. These decreases were partially offset by the NEIL   proceeds.
For the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 2011, the   variance was driven primarily by:  An approximately $1,210 million increase in net income after   non-cash adjustments (depreciation and amortizations, higher Edwardsport   charges, severance expense and other Progress Energy merger related costs),   resulting from the inclusion of Progress Energy's results beginning July 2,   2012 and the impact of the 2011 North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases,   net of unfavorable weather.
A $560 million increase in operating cash flows from lower   investment in traditional working capital, mainly due to an increase in   current year vacation and incentive accruals and prior year refund of North   Carolina overcollected fuels costs and current year overcollection of North   Carolina and South Carolina fuel costs, partially offset by;  A $100 million increase in contributions to company sponsored   pension plans due to contributions for Progress Energy pension plans.
INVESTING CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes key components of Duke Energys   investing cash flows for the three most recently completed fiscal years.
Years   Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Capital, investment and acquisition expenditures $ (5,607) $ (5,958) $ (4,464) Available for sale securities, net 173 (182) (131) Proceeds from sales of equity investments and other assets, and   sales of and collections on notes receivable 277 212 118 Other investing items 179 (269) 43 Net cash used in investing activities $ (4,978) $ (6,197) $ (4,434) The primary use of cash related to investing activities is   capital, investment and acquisition expenditures, detailed by reportable   business segment in the following table.

For the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 2011, the   variance was driven primarily by:  A $1,490 million increase in capital, investment and acquisition   expenditures primarily due to the inclusion of Progress Energy's capital   expenditures beginning July 2, 2012, higher expenditures on renewable energy   projects and the Chilean hydro acquisition, net of lower spending on Duke   Energy's ongoing infrastructure modernization program as these projects near   completion and  A $440 million increase in restricted cash primarily due to a   secured debt issuance related to Chilean hydro acquisition.
FINANCING CASH FLOWS The following table   summarizes key components of Duke Energys financing cash flows for the three   most recently completed fiscal years.
Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Issuance of common stock   related to employee benefit plans $ 9 $ 23 $ 67 Issuance of long-term   debt, net 840 1,672 2,292 Notes payable and   commercial paper 93 278 208 Dividends paid (2,188) (1,752) (1,329) Other financing items (81) 46 (36) Net cash (used in)   provided by financing activities $ (1,327) $ 267 $ 1,202 For the year ended   December 31, 2013 compared to 2012, the variance was driven primarily by:  A $832 million decrease   in net issuances of long-term debt, primarily due to the timing of issuances   and redemptions between years, resulting from the completion of major   construction projects,  A $436 million increase   in quarterly dividends primarily due to an increase in common shares   outstanding, resulting from the merger with Progress Energy and an increase   in dividends per share from $0.765 to $0.78 in the third quarter of 2013. The   total annual dividend per share was $3.09 in 2013 compared to $3.03 in 2012   and  A $185 million decrease   in proceeds from net issuances of notes payable and commercial paper,   primarily due to changes in short-term working capital needs.
For the year ended   December 31, 2012 compared to 2011, the variance was driven primarily by:  A $620 million decrease   in net issuances of long-term debt, primarily due to the timing of issuances and   redemptions between years and  A $420 million increase   in quarterly dividends primarily due to an increase in common shares   outstanding, resulting from the merger with Progress Energy and an increase   in dividends per share from $0.75 to $0.765 in the third quarter of 2012. The   total annual dividend per share was $3.03 in 2012 compared to $2.97 in 2011; These decreases in cash   provided were partially offset by:  A $70 million increase in   proceeds from net issuances of notes payable and commercial paper, primarily   due to the PremierNotes program, net of paydown of commercial paper.

65 PART II Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications.
Most of the guarantee arrangements entered into by Duke Energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not always included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of Duke Energy, either on its own or on behalf of Spectra Energy Capital, LLC (Spectra Capital) through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the January 2, 2007 spin-off of Spectra Energy Corp (Spectra Energy), having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events.
Duke Energy performs ongoing assessments of their respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased non-performance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy has issued guarantees.
See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Guarantees and Indemnifications, for further details of the guarantee arrangements.
Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energys operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
Other than the guarantee arrangements discussed above and normal operating lease arrangements, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures. For additional information on these commitments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies.
Contractual Obligations Duke Energy enters into contracts that require payment of cash at certain specified periods, based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices. The following table summarizes Duke Energys contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2013.
Payments   Due By Period (in millions) Total Less   than 1 year (2014) 2-3   years (2015 & 2016) 4-5   years (2017 & 2018) More   than 5 years (2019 & beyond) Long-term debt (a) $ 38,740 $ 2,007 $ 5,409 $ 4,355 $ 26,969 Interest payments on long-term debt (b) 24,082 1,632 2,972 2,675 16,803 Capital leases (c) 2,302 171 336 342 1,453 Operating leases (c) 1,769 175 306 254 1,034 Purchase obligations: (d) Fuel and purchased power (e) 26,893 5,163 6,787 4,099 10,844 Other purchase obligations (f) 6,193 4,400 646 305 842 Nuclear decommissioning trust annual funding (g) 912 52 105 92 663 Total contractual cash obligations (h)(i) $ 100,891 $ 13,600 $ 16,561 $ 12,122 $ 58,608 (a) See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt and   Credit Facilities.
(b) Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were   calculated using December 31, 2013 interest rates and holding them constant   for the life of the instruments.
(c) See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,   Commitments and Contingencies. Amounts in the table above include the   interest component of capital leases based on the interest rates stated in   the lease agreements and exclude certain related executory costs.
(d) Current liabilities, except for current maturities of long-term   debt, and purchase obligations reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,   have been excluded from the above table.
(e) Includes firm capacity payments that provide Duke Energy with   uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity and natural   gas transportation contracts, as well as undesignated contracts and contracts   that qualify as normal purchase/normal sale (NPNS). For contracts where the   price paid is based on an index, the amount is based on market prices at   December 31, 2013. For certain of these amounts, Duke Energy may settle on a   net cash basis since Duke Energy has entered into payment netting   arrangements with counterparties that permit Duke Energy to offset   receivables and payables with such counterparties.
(f) Includes contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting   or advisory services. Amount also includes contractual obligations for   engineering, procurement and construction costs for new generation plants and   nuclear plant refurbishments, environmental projects on fossil facilities,   major maintenance of certain nonregulated plants, maintenance and day to day   contract work at certain wind facilities and commitments to buy wind and   combustion turbines. Amount excludes certain open purchase orders for   services that are provided on demand, for which the timing of the purchase   cannot be determined.
(g) Related to future annual funding obligations to nuclear   decommissioning trust fund (NDTF) through nuclear power stations' re-licensing   dates. Amounts through 2017 include North Carolina jurisdictional amounts   that Duke Energy Progress retained internally and is transitioning to its   external decommissioning funds per a 2008 NCUC order. The transition of the   original $131 million must be complete by December 31, 2017, and at least 10   percent must be transitioned each year. See Note 9 to the Consolidated   Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations." (h) Uncertain tax positions of $230 million are not reflected in   this table as Duke Energy cannot predict when open income tax years will   close with completed examinations. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial   Statements, "Income Taxes." (i) The table above excludes reserves for litigation, environmental   remediation, asbestos-related injuries and damages claims and self-insurance   claims (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and   Contingencies) because Duke Energy is uncertain as to the timing of when   cash payments will be required. Additionally, the table above excludes annual   insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the business, including   nuclear insurance (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,   Commitments and Contingencies), funding of pension and other post-retirement   benefit plans (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,   "Employee Benefit Plans"), asset retirement obligations (see Note 9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations") and regulatory liabilities (see Note   4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters) because the   amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain. Also excluded are   Deferred Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits recorded on the Consolidated   Balance Sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based   primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year.
66 PART II QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Management Policies Duke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures, and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.
The following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Please review Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein.
Commodity Price Risk Duke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets. Duke Energys exposure to these fluctuations is limited by the cost-based regulation of its operations in its Regulated Utilities segment as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost-recovery clauses, including fuel clauses. While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations.
Price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energys exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional information, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivatives and Hedging.
Validation of a contracts fair value is performed by an internal group separate from Duke Energys deal origination function. While Duke Energy uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques, changes in its pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition.
HEDGING STRATEGIES Duke Energy closely monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas forward contracts to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. These instruments are also used to optimize the value of the nonregulated generation portfolio. Duke Energys primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against exposure to the prices of power and fuel.
The majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energys commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Undesignated contracts entered into by unregulated businesses are marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings.
Duke Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as an NPNS, Duke Energy applies such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contracts fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring.
GENERATION PORTFOLIO RISKS Duke Energy is primarily exposed to market price fluctuations of wholesale power, natural gas, and coal prices in the Regulated Utilities and Commercial Power segments. The Duke Energy Registrants optimize the value of their wholesale and nonregulated generation portfolios. The portfolios include generation assets, fuel, and emission allowances. Modeled forecasts of future generation output and fuel requirements are based on forward power and fuel markets. The component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units. For the Regulated Utilities segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is partially offset by mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers. The Commercial Power nonregulated generation portfolio dispatches all of its electricity into unregulated markets on a day-ahead and real-time basis and receives wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues from PJM. Commercial Power has economically hedged its forecasted coal-fired generation and a significant portion of its forecasted gas-fired generation for 2014. Commercial Power also has long-term economic hedges in place for a portion of expected coal and gas generation through 2017 and 2018, respectively. Capacity revenues are 100 percent fixed in PJM through May 2017. International Energy generally hedges its expected generation using long-term bilateral power sales contracts when favorable market conditions exist and it is subject to wholesale commodity price risks for electricity not sold under such contracts. International Energy dispatches electricity not sold under long-term bilateral contracts into unregulated markets and receives wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues from national system operators. Derivative contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks for delivery periods beyond 2014 are also exposed to changes in fair value due to market price fluctuations of wholesale power, fuel oil and coal. See Sensitivity Analysis for Generation Portfolio and Derivative Price Risks below, for more information regarding the effect of changes in commodity prices on Duke Energys net income.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR GENERATION PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE PRICE RISKS 68 PART II The table below summarizes the estimated effect of commodity price changes on Duke Energys pretax net income, based on a sensitivity analysis performed for the nonregulated generation portfolio. Forecasted exposure to commodity price risk for the Regulated Utilities segment is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on Duke Energys results of operations in 2014. The following commodity price sensitivity calculations consider existing hedge positions and estimated production levels, as indicated in the table below, but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices.
Summary of Sensitivity Analysis for Generation Portfolio and   Derivative Price Risks (in millions) Generation   Portfolio Risks   for 2014 As of December 31, (a) Sensitivities   for Derivatives Beyond 2014 As of December 31, (b) Potential effect on pretax net income assuming a 10% price   change in 2013 2012 2013 2012 Forward wholesale power prices (per MWh) $ 11 $ 34 $ 158 $ 103 Forward coal prices (per ton) 4 11   Gas prices (per MMBtu) 6 21   (a) Amounts related to forward wholesale prices represent the   potential impact of commodity price changes on forecasted economic generation   which has not been contracted or hedged. Amounts related to forward coal   prices and forward gas prices represent the potential impact of commodity   price changes on fuel needed to achieve such economic generation. Amounts   exclude the impact of mark-to-market changes on undesignated contracts   relating to periods in excess of one year from the respective date.
(b) Amounts represent sensitivities related to derivative contracts   executed to manage generation portfolio risks for periods beyond 2013.   Amounts exclude the potential impact of commodity price changes on forecasted   economic generation and fuel needed to achieve such forecasted generation.
Interest Rate Risk Duke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Duke Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See Notes 1, 6, 14, and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Debt and Credit Facilities, Derivatives and Hedging, and Fair Value Measurements.
The paragraph below summarizes the potential effect of interest rate changes on the Duke Energy Registrants pretax net income, based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of December31, 2013 and December31, 2012.
At December 31, 2013, Duke Energy had no notional amounts of fixed-to-floating hedges outstanding and no pre-issuance hedges outstanding. The weighted average interest rate on $5,677 million of long-term and short-term variable interest rate exposure that has not been hedged at December 31, 2013 was 1.45 percent.
These amounts were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges, short-term and long-term investments, cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of December31, 2013 and 2012. The change in interest rate sensitivity for Duke Energy is primarily due to changes in short-term debt balances and cash balances. If interest rates changed significantly, Duke Energy would likely take actions to manage its exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in Duke Energys financial structure.
Marketable Securities Price Risk As described further in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.
PENSION PLAN ASSETS Duke Energy maintains investments to help fund the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held.
A significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect Duke Energys results of operations in those periods.
NDTF As required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As of December 31, 2013, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, fixed-income securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code,NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. The investments in equity securities are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets. Duke Energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes. Accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail rates; therefore, fluctuations in equity prices do not affect their Consolidated Statements of Operations as changes in the fair value of these investments are deferred as regulatory assets or 69 PART II regulatory liabilities pursuant to an Order by the NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC. Earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail rates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments in Debt and Equity Securities for additional information regarding NDTF assets.
Foreign Currency Risk Duke Energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments in international businesses owned and operated in foreign countries and from certain commodity-related transactions within domestic operations that are denominated in foreign currencies. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the U.S.Dollar and/or local inflation rates, or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency. Duke Energy may also use foreign currency derivatives, where possible, to manage its risk related to foreign currency fluctuations. To monitor its currency exchange rate risks, Duke Energy uses sensitivity analysis, which measures the impact of devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure.
Duke Energys primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the Brazilian Real. The table below summarizes the potential effect of foreign currency devaluations on Duke Energys Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of December31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

Dan River Ash Basin Release On February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke Energy Carolinas retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe stopping the release of materials into the river. Duke Energy Carolinas estimates 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash and 24 million to 27 million gallons of basin water were released into the river.
Duke Energy cannot reasonably estimate the cost associated with remediation of this release at this time. Other costs related to the Dan River release and other ash basins, including regulatory directives, natural resources damages, future lawsuits, future claims, long-term environmental impact costs, long-term operational changes, and costs associated with new laws and regulations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Global Climate Change The Duke Energy Registrants greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions consist primarily of CO 2 with most coming from their fleet of coal-fired power plants in the U.S. In 2013, the Duke Energy Registrants U.S. power plants emitted approximately 134 million tons of CO 2 . CO 2 emissions from Duke Energys international operations were approximately 3 million tons. The Duke Energy Registrants future CO 2 emissions will be influenced by variables including new regulations, economic conditions that affect electricity demand, and the Duke Energy Registrants decisions regarding generation technologies deployed to meet customer electricity needs.
The Duke Energy Registrants do not anticipate any of the states in which they currently operate fossil-fueled electric generating units to implement requirements to reduce CO 2 emissions absent a federal requirement to mandate reductions in GHG emissions. On June 25, 2013, the President of the United States issued a memorandum directing the EPA to propose CO 2 emissions requirements for existing fossil-fuel 70 PART II electric generating units by June 1, 2014, and to finalize the guidelines for states to develop their own regulations for implementing the guidelines by June 1, 2015. The memorandum directed the EPA to require state to submit their implementation regulations for approval by June 30, 2016.
The Duke Energy Registrants are taking actions that will result in reduced GHG emissions over time. These actions will lower the Duke Energy Registrants exposure to any future mandatory GHG emission reduction requirements or carbon tax, whether a result of federal legislation or EPA regulation. Under any future scenario involving mandatory GHG limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of compliance costs associated with their regulated operations through appropriate regulatory mechanisms.
The Duke Energy Registrants recognize certain groups associate severe weather events with climate change, and forecast the possibility these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential changes of extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration, and severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place, and the inability to predict these with any degree of accuracy, make estimating any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants impossible. Currently, the Duke Energy Registrants plan and prepare for extreme weather events they experience from time to time, such as ice storms, tornados, hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, high winds and droughts.
The Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric distribution systems. The Duke Energy Registrants electric generating facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy Registrants maintain an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the effects of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity. The Duke Energy Registrants have a program in place to effectively manage the impact of future droughts on their operations.
Other EPA Regulations Recently Published and Under Development The EPA has issued and is in various stages of developing several non-greenhouse gas (non-GHG) environmental regulations that will affect the Duke Energy Registrants. These include the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for hazardous air pollutants, which is effective beginning in 2015, as well as proposed regulations for cooling water intake structures under the Clean Water Act 316(b), coal combustion residuals, and steam effluent limitation guidelines. As a group, these non-GHG environmental regulations will require the Duke Energy Registrants to install additional environmental controls and accelerate retirement of some coal-fired units. While the ultimate regulatory requirements for the Duke Energy Registrants from the group of EPA regulatory actions will not be known until all the rules have been finalized, for planning purposes, the Duke Energy Registrants currently estimate the cost of new control equipment that may need to be installed to comply with this group of rules could total $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, excluding AFUDC, over the next 10 years. This range includes estimated costs for new control equipment necessary to comply with the MATS of $525 million to $625 million. The Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance, and other expenses in conjunction with the non-GHG regulations. The Duke Energy Registrants are planning to retire coal-fired generating capacity that is not economic to bring into compliance with the EPAs regulations. Beyond 2013, total planned and potential retirements could exceed 2,400 MW of coal-fired generating capacity. The Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur costs for replacement generation as a result of the potential coal-fired power plant retirements. Until the final regulatory requirements of the group of EPA regulations are known and can be fully evaluated, the potential compliance costs associated with these EPA regulatory actions are subject to considerable uncertainty. Therefore, the actual compliance costs incurred and MW to be retired may be materially different from these estimates based on the timing and requirements of the final EPA regulations.
For additional information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies.
Nuclear Matters Following the events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in Japan, Duke Energy conducted thorough inspections at each of its seven nuclear sites during 2011. The initial inspections did not identify any significant vulnerabilities, however, Duke Energy is reviewing designs to evaluate safety margins to external events. Emergency-response capabilities, written procedures and engineering specifications were reviewed to verify each sites ability to respond in the unlikely event of station blackout. Duke Energy is working within the nuclear industry to improve safety standards and margin using the three layers of safety approach used in the U.S.: protection, mitigation and emergency response. Emergency equipment is currently being added at each station to perform key safety functions in the event that backup power sources are lost permanently. These improvements are in addition to the numerous layers of safety measures and systems previously in place.
In March 2011, the NRC formed a task force to conduct a comprehensive review of processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make additional improvements to the nuclear regulatory system. On July 13, 2011, the task force proposed a set of improvements designed to ensure protection, enhance accident mitigation, strengthen emergency preparedness and improve efficiency of NRC programs. The recommendations were further prioritized into three tiers based on the safety enhancement level. On March 12, 2012, the NRC issued three regulatory orders requiring safety enhancements related to mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at a plant, ensuring reliable hardened containment vents and enhancing spent fuel pool instrumentation.
On August 30, 2012, the NRC issued implementation guidance to enable power plants to achieve compliance with the orders issued in March 2012. Plants were required to submit implementation plans to the NRC by February 28, 2013, and complete implementation of the safety enhancements within two refueling outages or by December 31, 2016, whichever comes first. Each plant is also required to reassess their seismic and flooding hazards using present-day methods and information, conduct inspections to ensure protection against hazards in the current design basis, and re-evaluate emergency communications systems and staffing levels.
Duke Energy is committed to compliance with all safety enhancements ordered by the NRC in connection with the March 12, 2012, regulatory orders noted above, the cost of which could be material. Until such time as the NRC-mandated reassessment of flooding and seismic hazards is complete the exact scope and cost of compliance modifications to Duke Energys sites will not be known. With the NRCs continuing review of the remaining recommendations, Duke Energy cannot predict to what extent the NRC will impose additional licensing and safety-related requirements, or the costs of complying with such requirements. Upon receipt of additional guidance from the NRC and a collaborative 71 PART II industry review, Duke Energy will be able to determine an implementation plan and associated costs. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion of applicable risk factors.

211 73 PART II REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Duke Energy Corporation Charlotte, North Carolina We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Duke Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

See  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 80 PART II REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC Charlotte, North Carolina We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in members equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC and subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Charlotte, North Carolina We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Progress Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in common stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Progress Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

(the "Company") as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in common stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Duke Energy Florida, Inc. at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Other comprehensive income presented on Progress Energys Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income are attributable to controlling interests for all periods presented.
Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements that conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S., the Duke Energy Registrants must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, INC.  DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, INC. - DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC.  - DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, INC.
Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Regulatory Accounting The majority of the Duke Energy Registrants operations are subject to price regulation for the sale of electricity and gas by state utility commissions or FERC. When prices are set on the basis of specific costs of the regulated operations and an effective franchise is in place such that sufficient gas or electric services can be sold to recover those costs, the Duke Energy Registrants apply regulatory accounting. Regulatory accounting changes the timing of the recognition of costs or revenues relative to a company that does not apply regulatory accounting. As a result, Regulatory assets and Regulatory liabilities are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment of the related cost in the ratemaking process. See Note 4 for further information.
Regulated Fuel Costs and Purchased Power The Duke Energy Registrants utilize cost-tracking mechanisms, commonly referred to as fuel adjustment clauses. These clauses allow for the recovery of fuel and fuel-related costs and portions of purchased power costs through surcharges on customer rates. The difference between the costs incurred and the surcharge revenues is recorded as an adjustment to Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power  regulated or Operating Revenues  Regulated electric on the Consolidated Statements of Operations with an off-setting impact on regulatory assets or liabilities.
Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. At December 31, 2013, $1,086 million of Duke Energys total cash and cash equivalents is held by entities domiciled in foreign jurisdictions and is forecasted to be used to fund international operations and investments.
Restricted Cash The Duke Energy Registrants have restricted cash related primarily to collateral assets, escrow deposits, and variable interest entities (VIEs). Restricted cash balances are reflected in Other within Current Assets and in Other within Investments and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, Duke Energy had restricted cash totaling $307 million and $574 million, respectively.
Inventory Inventory is used for operations and is recorded primarily using the average cost method. Inventory related to regulated operations is valued at historical cost. Inventory related to nonregulated operations is valued at the lower of cost or market. Materials and supplies are recorded as inventory when purchased and subsequently charged to expense or capitalized to property, plant and equipment when installed. Reserves are established for excess and obsolete inventory. The components of inventory are presented in the tables below.

Both categories are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings. For certain investments of regulated operations such as the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund (NDTF), realized and unrealized gains and losses (including any other-than-temporary impairments) on available-for-sale securities are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. Otherwise, unrealized gains and losses are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), unless other-than-temporarily impaired. Other-than-temporary impairments for equity securities and the credit loss portion of debt securities of nonregulated operations are included in earnings. Investments in debt and equity securities are classified as either current or noncurrent based on managements intent and ability to sell these securities, taking into consideration current market liquidity. See Note 15 for further information.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill 114 PART II DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION - DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC -  PROGRESS ENERGY, INC.
DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, INC.  DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, INC. - DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC.  - DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, INC.
Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Ohio perform annual goodwill impairment tests as of August31 each year at the reporting unit level, which is determined to be an operating segment or one level below. Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Ohio update these tests between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
In 2012, Progress Energy changed its goodwill impairment testing date from October 31 to August 31 to better align its annual goodwill impairment testing procedure with those of Duke Energy. The change had no impact on goodwill. Neither the change in the goodwill impairment testing date nor the merger resulted in any changes to the Progress Energy reporting units.
Intangible Assets Intangible assets are included in Other in Investments and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, intangible assets are amortized using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed, or on a straight-line basis if that pattern is not readily determinable. Amortization of intangibles is reflected in Depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Intangible assets are subject to impairment testing and if impaired, the carrying value is accordingly reduced.
Emission allowances permit the holder of the allowance to emit certain gaseous by-products of fossil fuel combustion, including sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NO x ). Allowances are issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at zero cost and may also be bought and sold via third-party transactions. Allowances allocated to or acquired by the Duke Energy Registrants are held primarily for consumption. Carrying amounts for emission allowances are based on the cost to acquire the allowances or, in the case of a business combination, on the fair value assigned in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired business.
Renewable energy certificates are used to measure compliance with renewable energy standards and are held primarily for consumption.
See Note 11 for further information.
Long-Lived Asset Impairments The Duke Energy Registrants evaluate long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when a long-lived assets carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. The estimated cash flows may be based on alternative expected outcomes that are probability weighted. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable based on these estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of the asset is written-down to its then-current estimated fair value and an impairment charge is recognized.
The Duke Energy Registrants assess fair value of long-lived assets using various methods, including recent comparable third-party sales, internally developed discounted cash flow analysis and analysis from outside advisors. Significant changes in commodity prices, the condition of an asset or managements interest in selling the asset are generally viewed as triggering events to re-assess cash flows. See Note 11 for further information.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at the lower of depreciated historical cost net of any disallowances or fair value, if impaired. The Duke Energy Registrants capitalize all construction-related direct labor and material costs, as well as indirect construction costs such as general engineering, taxes and financing costs. See Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized for information on capitalized financing costs. Costs of renewals and betterments that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are also capitalized. The cost of repairs, replacements and major maintenance projects, which do not extend the useful life or increase the expected output of the asset, are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is generally computed over the estimated useful life of the asset using the composite straight-line method. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update composite rates and are approved by state utility commissions and/or the FERC when required. The composite weighted-average depreciation rates, excluding nuclear fuel, are included in the table that follows.
Years   Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Duke Energy 2.8 % 2.9 % 3.2 % Duke Energy Carolinas 2.8 % 2.8 % 2.6 % Progress Energy 2.5 % 2.6 % 2.3 % Duke Energy Progress 2.5 % 2.7 % 2.1 % Duke Energy Florida 2.4 % 2.5 % 2.4 % Duke Energy Ohio 3.3 % 3.2 % 3.5 % Duke Energy Indiana 2.8 % 3.3 % 3.4 % In general, when the Duke Energy Registrants retire regulated property, plant and equipment, original cost plus the cost of retirement, less salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. However, when it becomes probable a regulated asset will be retired substantially in advance of its original expected useful life or is abandoned, the cost of the asset and the corresponding accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset. If the asset is still in operation, the net amount is classified as Generation facilities to be retired, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the asset is no longer operating, the net amount is classified in Regulatory Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value of the asset is based on historical cost if the Duke Energy Registrants are allowed to recover the remaining net book value and a return equal to at least the incremental borrowing rate. If not, an impairment is recognized to the extent the net book value of the asset exceeds the present value of future revenues discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.

DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, INC.  DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, INC. - DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC.  - DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, INC.
Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) When the Duke Energy Registrants sell entire regulated operating units, or retire or sell nonregulated properties, the original cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization balances are removed from Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any gain or loss is recorded in earnings, unless otherwise required by the applicable regulatory body.
See Note 10 for further information.
Nuclear Fuel Nuclear fuel is classified as Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nuclear fuel in the front-end fuel processing phase is considered work in progress and not amortized until placed in service. Amortization of nuclear fuel is included within Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power  regulated in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization is recorded using the units-of-production method.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized For regulated operations, the debt and equity costs of financing the construction of property, plant and equipment are reflected as AFUDC and capitalized as a component of the cost of property, plant and equipment. AFUDC equity is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as non-cash income in Other income and expenses, net. AFUDC debt is reported as a non-cash offset to Interest Expense. After construction is completed, the Duke Energy Registrants are permitted to recover these costs through their inclusion in rate base and the corresponding subsequent depreciation or amortization of those regulated assets.
AFUDC equity, a permanent difference for income taxes, reduces the effective tax rate when capitalized and increases the effective tax rate when depreciated or amortized. See Note 22 for additional information.
For nonregulated operations, interest is capitalized during the construction phase with an offsetting non-cash credit to Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Asset Retirement Obligations Asset retirement obligations are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment. Substantially all asset retirement obligations are related to regulated operations. When recording an asset retirement obligation, the present value of the projected liability is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The liability is accreted over time. The present value of the liability is added to the cost of the associated asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset.
The present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of future cash flows, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change. Depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively for any changes to the carrying amount of the associated asset. The Duke Energy Registrants receive amounts to fund the cost of the asset retirement obligation for regulated operations through a combination of regulated revenues and NDTF. As a result, the net of amounts recovered in regulated revenues, earnings on the NDTF, accretion expense and depreciation of the associated asset is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.
Obligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. Duke Energy Florida assumes Crystal River Nuclear Station  Unit 3 (Crystal River Unit 3) will be placed into a safe storage configuration until eventual dismantlement begins in approximately 60 years. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on site until such time that it can be transferred to a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility.
See Note 9 for further information.
Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenue Revenues on sales of electricity and gas are recognized when service is provided. Unbilled revenues are recognized by applying customer billing rates to the estimated volumes of energy delivered but not yet billed. Unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of seasonality, weather, customer usage patterns and meter reading schedules.
Unbilled revenues are included within Receivables and Restricted receivables of variable interest entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as shown in the following table.

Accordingly, the receivables sold are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 for further information. These receivables for unbilled revenues are shown in the table below.

All derivative instruments except those that qualify for the normal purchase/normal sale (NPNS) exception are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. Qualifying derivative instruments may be designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. Other derivative instruments (undesignated contracts) either have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of a fair value hedge is offset in net income by changes in the hedged item. For activity subject to regulatory accounting, gains and losses on derivative contracts are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities and not as other comprehensive income or current period income. As a result, changes in fair value of these derivatives have no immediate earnings impact.
Formal documentation, including transaction type and risk management strategy, is maintained for all contracts accounted for as a hedge. At inception and at least every three months thereafter, the hedge contract is assessed to see if it is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items.
See Note 14 for further information.
Captive Insurance Reserves Duke Energy has captive insurance subsidiaries that provide coverage, on an indemnity basis, to the Subsidiary Registrants as well as certain third parties, on a limited basis, for various business risks and losses, such as property, workers compensation and general liability. Liabilities include provisions for estimated losses incurred but not yet reported (IBNR), as well as estimated provisions for known claims. IBNR reserve estimates are primarily based upon historical loss experience, industry data and other actuarial assumptions. Reserve estimates are adjusted in future periods as actual losses differ from experience.
Duke Energy, through its captive insurance entities, also has reinsurance coverage with third parties for certain losses above a per occurrence and/or aggregate retention. Receivables for reinsurance coverage are recognized when realization is deemed probable.
Unamortized Debt Premium, Discount and Expense Premiums, discounts and expenses incurred with the issuance of outstanding long-term debt are amortized over the term of the debt issue. Call premiums and unamortized expenses associated with refinancing higher-cost debt obligations used to finance regulated assets are amortized. Amortization expense is recorded as Interest Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and is reflected as Depreciation, amortization and accretion within Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Loss Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities Contingent losses are recorded when it is probable a loss has occurred and can be reasonably estimated. When a range of the probable loss exists and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is recorded. Unless otherwise required by GAAP, legal fees are expensed as incurred.
Environmental liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental remediation or other liabilities becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Environmental expenditures related to past operations that do not generate current or future revenues are 117 PART II DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION - DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC -  PROGRESS ENERGY, INC.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) expensed. Environmental expenditures related to operations that generate current or future revenues are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Certain environmental expenditures receive regulatory accounting treatment and are recorded as regulatory assets.
See Notes 4 and 5 for further information.
Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Duke Energy maintains qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans. Eligible employees of the Subsidiary Registrants participate in the respective qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans and are allocated their proportionate share of benefit costs. See Note 21 for further information, including significant accounting policies associated with these plans.
Severance and Special Termination Benefits Duke Energy has an ongoing severance plan under which, in general, the longer a terminated employee worked prior to termination the greater the amount of severance benefits. A liability for involuntary severance is recorded once an involuntary severance plan is committed to by management, or sooner, if involuntary severances are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For involuntary severance benefits incremental to its ongoing severance plan benefits, the fair value of the obligation is expensed at the communication date if there are no future service requirements, or over the required future service period. From time to time, Duke Energy offers special termination benefits under voluntary severance programs. Special termination benefits are recorded immediately upon employee acceptance absent a significant retention period. Otherwise, the cost is recorded over the remaining service period. Employee acceptance of voluntary severance benefits is determined by management based on the facts and circumstances of the benefits being offered. See Note 19 for further information.
Guarantees Liabilities are recognized at the time of issuance or material modification of a guarantee for the estimated fair value of the obligation it assumes. Fair value is estimated using a probability-weighted approach. The obligation is reduced over the term of the guarantee or related contract in a systematic and rational method as risk is reduced. Any additional contingent loss for guarantee contracts subsequent to the initial recognition of a liability is accounted for and recognized at the time a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. See Note 7 for further information.
Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation represents costs related to stock-based awards granted to employees. Duke Energy recognizes stock-based compensation based upon the estimated fair value of awards, net of estimated forfeitures at the date of issuance. The recognition period for these costs begin at either the applicable service inception date or grant date and continues throughout the requisite service period, or for certain share-based awards until the employee becomes retirement eligible, if earlier. Compensation cost is recognized as expense or capitalized as a component of property, plant and equipment. See Note 20 for further information.
Income Taxes Duke Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and other state and foreign jurisdictional returns. The Subsidiary Registrants entered into a tax-sharing agreement with Duke Energy and income taxes recorded represent amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur as separate C-Corporations. Deferred income taxes have been provided for temporary differences between GAAP and tax bases of assets and liabilities because the differences create taxable or tax-deductible amounts for future periods. Deferred taxes are not provided on translation gains and losses when earnings of a foreign operation are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. Investment tax credits (ITC) associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized as a reduction of income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the related properties.
Positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns, including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return, are recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the tax position can be sustained based solely on the technical merits of the position. The largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being effectively settled is recorded. Management considers a tax position effectively settled when: (i)the taxing authority has completed its examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews; (ii)the Duke Energy Registrants do not intend to appeal or litigate the tax position included in the completed examination; and (iii)it is remote the taxing authority would examine or re-examine the tax position. The amount of a tax return position that is not recognized in the financial statements is disclosed as an unrecognized tax benefit. These unrecognized tax benefits may impact the financial statements through increasing income taxes payable, reducing income tax refunds receivable or changing deferred taxes.
Tax-related interest and penalties are recorded in Interest Expense and Other Income and Expenses, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
See Note 22 for further information.
Accounting for Renewable Energy Tax Credits and Grants When Duke Energy elects either an ITC or a cash grant on wind or solar facilities, it reduces the basis of the property recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets by the amount of the ITC or cash grant and, therefore, the ITC or grant benefit is recognized through reduced depreciation expense. Additionally, certain tax credits and government grants received provide for initial tax depreciable base in excess of the book carrying value equal to one half of the ITC or government grant. Deferred tax benefits are recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period that the basis difference is created.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Excise Taxes Certain excise taxes levied by state or local governments are required to be paid even if not collected from the customer. These taxes are recognized on a gross basis. Otherwise, the taxes are accounted for net. Excise taxes accounted for on a gross basis as Property and other taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were as follows.
Years   Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Duke Energy $ 602 $ 466 $ 293 Duke Energy Carolinas 164 161 153 Progress Energy 304 317 315 Duke Energy Progress 115 113 110 Duke Energy Florida 189 205 205 Duke Energy Ohio 105 102 109 Duke Energy Indiana 29 33 31 On July 23, 2013, North Carolina House Bill 998 (HB 998) was   signed into law.HB 998 repeals the utility franchise tax effective July   1, 2014. The utility franchise tax was 3.22 percent gross receipts tax on   sales of electricity. The result of this change in law will be an annual   reduction in excise taxes of approximately $160 million for Duke Energy   Carolinas and approximately $110 million for Duke Energy Progress. HB 998   also increases sales tax on electricity from 3 percent to 7 percent effective   July 1, 2014. HB 998 requires the NCUC to adjust retail electric rates for the   elimination of the utility franchise tax, changes due to the increase in   sales tax on electricity, and the resulting change in liability of utility   companies under the general franchise tax.
Foreign Currency Translation The local currencies of most of Duke Energys foreign operations have been determined to be their functional currencies. However, certain foreign operations functional currency has been determined to be the U.S.Dollar, based on an assessment of the economic circumstances of the foreign operation .
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currency is not the U.S.Dollar, are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end. Translation adjustments resulting from changes in exchange rates are included in AOCI. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Gains and losses arising from balances and transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are included in the results of operations when they occur.
Dividend Restrictions and Unappropriated Retained Earnings Duke Energy does not have any legal, regulatory or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders. However, as further described in Note 4, due to conditions established by regulators in conjunction with merger transaction approvals, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana have restrictions on paying dividends or otherwise advancing funds to Duke Energy. At December31, 2013 and 2012, an insignificant amount of Duke Energys consolidated Retained earnings balance represents undistributed earnings of equity method investments.
New Accounting Standards The new accounting standards that were adopted for 2013, 2012 and 2011 had no significant impact on the presentation or results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Duke Energy Registrants. Disclosures have been enhanced to provide a discussion and tables on derivative contracts subject to enforceable master netting agreements and a table of quantitative disclosures about unobservable inputs. See Notes 14 and 16 for further information.
There are no Accounting Standards Updates that have been issued but not yet adopted as of December 31, 2013, that are expected to significantly impact the presentation or results of operations, cash flows or financial position or disclosures of the Duke Energy Registrants .
2. ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND SALES OF OTHER ASSETS ACQUISITIONS The Duke Energy Registrants consolidate assets and liabilities from acquisitions as of the purchase date, and include earnings from acquisitions in consolidated earnings after the purchase date.
Merger with Progress Energy On July 2, 2012, Duke Energy completed its merger with Progress Energy, a North Carolina corporation engaged in the regulated utility business of generation, transmission and distribution and sale of electricity in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. As a result of the merger, Progress Energy became a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy .
The merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy provides increased scale and diversity with potentially enhanced access to capital over the long term and a greater ability to undertake the significant construction programs necessary to respond to increasing environmental regulation, plant retirements and customer demand growth. Duke Energys business risk profile is expected to improve over time due to the increased proportion of the business that is regulated. Additionally, cost savings, efficiencies and other benefits are expected from the combined operations.

DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, INC.  DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, INC. - DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC.  - DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, INC.
Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Total consideration transferred was based on the closing price of Duke Energy common shares on July 2, 2012, and was calculated as shown in the following table .
(dollars in millions, except per share amounts; shares in   thousands) Progress Energy common shares outstanding at July 2, 2012 296,116 Exchange ratio 0.87083 Duke Energy common shares issued for Progress Energy common   shares outstanding 257,867 Closing price of Duke Energy common shares on July 2, 2012 $ 69.84 Purchase price for common stock $ 18,009 Fair value of outstanding earned stock compensation awards 62 Total purchase price $ 18,071 Progress Energys stock-based compensation awards, including performance shares and restricted stock, were replaced with Duke Energy awards upon consummation of the merger. In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, a portion of the fair value of these awards is included in the purchase price as it represents consideration transferred in the merger.
Purchase Price Allocation Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was determined based on significant estimates and assumptions, including Level 3 inputs, which are judgmental in nature. Estimates and assumptions include the projected timing and amount of future cash flows, discount rates reflecting risk inherent in future cash flows, and future market prices.
Additionally the February 5, 2013 announcement of the decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3 reflects additional information related to facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date. See Note 4 for additional information related to Crystal River Unit 3. As such, Duke Energy presents assets acquired and liabilities assumed as if the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3 occurred on the acquisition date.
The majority of Progress Energys operations are subject to the rate-setting authority of the FERC, NCUC, PSCSC, and FPSC and are accounted for pursuant to U.S. GAAP, including the accounting guidance for regulated operations. Rate-setting and cost recovery provisions currently in place for Progress Energys regulated operations provide revenues derived from costs, including a return on investment of assets and liabilities included in rate base. Except for long-term debt, asset retirement obligations, capital leases, pension and other post-retirement benefits (OPEB) plans, and the wholesale portion of Crystal River Unit 3, fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to these rate-setting provisions approximate their carrying values. Accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pro forma financial information do not reflect any net adjustments related to these amounts. The difference between fair value and pre-merger carrying amounts for long-term debt, asset retirement obligations, capital leases and pension and OPEB plans for regulated operations were recorded as Regulatory assets.
The excess of purchase price over estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill at the acquisition date. The goodwill reflects the value paid primarily for long-term potential for enhanced access to capital as a result of increased scale and diversity, opportunities for synergies, and an improved risk profile. Goodwill resulting from the merger was allocated entirely to the Regulated Utilities segment. None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes, and as such, no deferred taxes have been recorded related to goodwill.
The completed purchase price allocation is presented in the following table.
(in millions) Current assets $ 3,204 Property, plant and equipment 23,141 Goodwill 12,469 Other long-term assets 9,990 Total assets 48,804 Current liabilities, including current maturities of long-term   debt 3,593 Long-term liabilities, preferred stock and noncontrolling   interests 10,394 Long-term debt 16,746 Total liabilities and preferred stock 30,733 Total purchase price $ 18,071 The purchase price allocation in the table above reflects refinements made to preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2012. These refinements include adjustments associated with the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3. The changes resulted in an increase to Goodwill of $2 million, an increase to the fair value of Current liabilities, including current maturities of long-term debt of $12 million, a decrease to Property, plant and equipment of $138 million, a decrease to Other long-term assets of $4 million and a decrease to Long-term liabilities, preferred stock and noncontrolling interests of $152 million. These refinements had no impact on the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments recorded to earnings during the year ended December 31, 2013, or for the six months ended December 31, 2012.
Pro Forma Financial Information The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of Duke Energy and the amortization of purchase price adjustments assuming the merger had taken place on January 1, 2011. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that would have been achieved or future consolidated results of operations of Duke Energy.

Charges related to transmission projects and impairment of the carrying value of generation assets were recorded within Impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Mark-to-market losses on interim power sale agreements was recorded in Regulated electric operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Subsequent changes in fair value of interim power sale agreements over the life of the contracts and realized gains or losses on interim contract sales are also recorded within Regulated electric operating revenues. The ability to successfully defend future recovery of a portion of transmission projects in rates and any future changes to estimated transmission project costs could impact the amount not expected to be recovered.
In conjunction with the merger, in November 2011, Duke Energy and Progress Energy each offered a voluntary severance plan (VSP) to certain eligible employees. VSP and other severance costs incurred were recorded primarily within Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 19 for further information related to employee severance expenses.
Community support, charitable contributions and other reflect (i) the unconditional obligation to provide funding at a level comparable to historic practices over the next four years, and (ii) financial and legal advisory costs incurred upon the closing of the merger, retention and relocation costs paid to certain employees. These charges were recorded within Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Impact of Merger The impact of Progress Energy on Duke Energys revenues and net income attributable to Duke Energy in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 was an increase of $4,943 million and $368 million, respectively.
Chilean Operations In December 2012, Duke Energy acquired Iberoamericana de Energa Ibener , S.A. (Ibener) of Santiago, Chile for cash consideration of $415 million. This acquisition included the 140 Megawatt (MW) Duqueco hydroelectric generation complex consisting of two run-of-the-river plants located in southern Chile. Purchase price allocation consisted primarily of $383 million of property, plant and equipment, $30 million of intangible assets, $57 million of deferred income tax liabilities, $54 million of goodwill and $8 million of working capital .
In connection with the acquisition, a $190 million six-month bridge loan and a $200 million revolving loan under a credit agreement were executed with a commercial bank. Both loans were fully collateralized with cash deposits, and therefore no net proceeds from the financings existed as of December 31, 2012. The $190 million bridge loan was classified in Current maturities of long-term debt and the related cash collateral deposit was classified as Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012. The revolving loan is classified as Long-term Debt and the related cash collateral deposit is classified as Investments and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In April 2013, the six-month bridge loan executed in connection with the acquisition was replaced with a nonrecourse secured credit facility with a term of thirteen years, and the cash collateral related to the six-month bridge loan was returned to Duke Energy. See Note 6 for additional discussion related to the bridge loan conversion.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Midwest Generation Exit On February 17, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio announced that it had initiated a process to exit its nonregulated Midwest generation business. Considering a marketing period of several months and potential regulatory approvals, Duke Energy Ohio expects to dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business by early to mid-2015. In the first quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Ohio will reclassify approximately $3.5 billion carrying value of its Midwest generation business to assets held for sale and expects to record an estimated pretax impairment charge of $1 billion to $2 billion to reduce the carrying value to estimated sales proceeds less cost to sell.
Vermillion Generating Station On January 12, 2012, after receiving approvals from the FERC and IURC on August 12, 2011 and December 28, 2011, respectively, Duke Energy Vermillion II, LLC (Duke Energy Vermillion), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, completed the sale of its ownership interest in Vermillion Generating Station (Vermillion) to Duke Energy Indiana and Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA). Upon closing of the sale, Duke Energy Indiana held a 62.5 percent interest in Vermillion. Duke Energy Ohio received net proceeds of $82 million, of which $68 million was paid by Duke Energy Indiana. Following the transaction, Duke Energy Indiana retired Gallagher Units 1 and 3 effective February 1, 2012.
As Duke Energy Indiana is an affiliate of Duke Energy Vermillion, the transaction was accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control with no gain or loss recorded and did not have a significant impact to Duke Energy Ohios or Duke Energy Indianas results of operations. Proceeds received from Duke Energy Indiana are included in Net proceeds from the sales of other assets on Duke Energy Ohios Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash paid to Duke Energy Ohio is included in Capital expenditures on Duke Energy Indianas Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana recognized non-cash equity transfers of $28 million and $26 million, respectively, in their Consolidated Statements of Common Stockholders Equity on the transaction representing the difference between cash exchanged and the net book value of Vermillion. These amounts are not reflected in Duke Energys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows or Consolidated Statements of Equity as the transaction is eliminated in consolidation.
Proceeds from WVPA are included in Net proceeds from the sales of other assets, and sale of and collections on notes receivable on Duke Energys and Duke Energy Ohios Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The sale of the proportionate share of Vermillion to WVPA did not result in a significant gain or loss upon close of the transaction.
Wind Projects Joint Venture In April 2012, Duke Energy executed a joint venture agreement with Sumitomo Corporation of America (SCOA). Under terms of the agreement, Duke Energy and SCOA each own a 50 percent interest in the joint venture (DS Cornerstone, LLC), which owns two wind generation projects. Duke Energy and SCOA also negotiated a $330 million, Construction and 12-year amortizing Term Loan Facility, on behalf of the borrower, a wholly owned subsidiary of the joint venture. The loan agreement is non-recourse to Duke Energy. Duke Energy received proceeds of $319 million upon execution of the loan agreement. This amount represents reimbursement of a significant portion of Duke Energys construction costs incurred as of the date of the agreement. DS Cornerstone, LLC was initially consolidated with the sale to SCOA because of a guarantee provided by an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy. With the expiration of the guarantee in 2012, DS Cornerstone, LLC was deconsolidated.
Sales Of Other Assets During 2012, Duke Energy received proceeds of $187 million from the sale of non-core business assets within the Commercial Power segment for which no material gain or loss was recognized.
3. BUSINESS SEGMENTS Duke Energy evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Segment income, as discussed below, includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Operating segments are determined based on information used by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate the performance.
Products and services are sold between affiliate companies and reportable segments of Duke Energy at cost. Segment assets as presented in the tables that follow exclude all intercompany assets.
Duke Energy Duke Energy has the following reportable operating segments: Regulated Utilities, International Energy and Commercial Power.
Regulated Utilities conducts operations primarily through Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana, and the regulated transmission and distribution operations of Duke Energy Ohio. These electric and gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC, PUCO, IURC, and KPSC. Substantially all of Regulated Utilities operations are regulated and, accordingly, these operations qualify for regulatory accounting treatment.
International Energy principally operates and manages power generation facilities and engages in sales and marketing of electric power, natural gas, and natural gas liquids outside the U.S. Its activities principally target power generation in Latin America. Additionally, International Energy owns a 25 percent interest in National Methanol Company (NMC), a large regional producer of Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) located in Saudi Arabia. The investment in NMC is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

Restrictions on the Ability of Certain Subsidiaries to Make Dividends, Advances and Loans to Duke Energy As a condition to the approval of merger transactions, the NCUC, PSCSC, PUCO, KPSC, and IURC imposed conditions on the ability of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana to transfer funds to Duke Energy through loans or advances, as well as restricted amounts available to pay dividends to Duke Energy. Certain subsidiaries may transfer funds to the parent by obtaining approval of the respective state regulatory commissions. These conditions imposed restrictions on the ability of the public utility subsidiaries to pay cash dividends as discussed below.
Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation which, in certain circumstances, limited their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Amounts restricted as a result of these provisions were not material at December 31, 2013.

On November 21, 2013, the NCAG appealed the reaffirmed order. On December 11, 2013, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, along with the Public Staff, filed a Motion to Consolidate this appeal with other North Carolina rate case appeals involving Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. Both the NCAG and NC WARN filed responses with the NCSC contesting consolidation. All parties are awaiting a ruling from the NCSC. Duke Energy Carolinas cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
William States Lee III Nuclear Station In December 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas applied to the NRC for a Combined Construction and Operating License (COL) for two Westinghouse AP1000 (advanced passive) reactors for the proposed William States Lee III Nuclear Station (Lee Nuclear Station) at a site in Cherokee County, South Carolina. Submitting the COL application did not commit Duke Energy Carolinas to build nuclear units. Through several separate orders, the NCUC and PSCSC concurred with the prudency of Duke Energy Carolinas incurring certain project development and pre-construction costs , although recovery of costs is not guaranteed. Duke Energy Carolinas has incurred approximately $382 million, including AFUDC through December 31, 2013. This amount is included in Net property, plant and equipment on Duke Energy Carolinas Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Lee COL application is impacted by the ongoing NRC activity to address its Waste Confidence rule. The Waste Confidence rule is a generic finding by the NRC that spent fuel can be managed safely until ultimate disposal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit) remanded the rule to the NRC. The NRC determined that no final licenses for new reactors would be issued until the remand is appropriately addressed. Based upon current timelines from the NRC, licenses would not be issued until November 2014 at the 129 PART II DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION - DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC -  PROGRESS ENERGY, INC.

Duke Energy Progress 2012 North Carolina Rate Case On May 30, 2013, the NCUC approved a settlement agreement related to Duke Energy Progress request for a rate increase. The Public Staff was a party to the settlement agreement. The parties agreed to a two-year step-in rate increase, with the first year providing for a $147 million, or a 4.5 percent average increase in rates, and the second year providing for rates to be increased by an additional $31 million, or a 1.0 percent average increase in rates. The agreement is based upon a return on equity of 10.2 percent and an equity component of the capital structure of 53 percent. The settlement agreement (i) allows for the recognition of nuclear outage expenses over the refueling cycle rather than when the outage occurs, (ii) a $20 million shareholder contribution to agencies that provide energy assistance to low-income customers, and (iii) a reduction in the regulatory liability for costs of removal of $20 million for the first year. New rates went into effect on June 1, 2013.
On July 1, 2013, the NCAG appealed the NCUCs approval of the rate of return and capital structure included in the agreement. NC WARN also appealed various matters in the settlement. On December 11, 2013, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, along with the Public Staff, filed a Motion to Consolidate this appeal with other North Carolina rate case appeals involving Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. Both the NCAG and NC WARN filed responses with the NCSC contesting consolidation. All parties are awaiting a ruling from the NCSC. Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
L.V. Sutton Combined Cycle Facility Duke Energy Progress completed construction of a 625 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired generating facility at its existing Sutton Steam Station in New Hanover County, North Carolina. Sutton began commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Harris Expansion On February 19, 2008, Duke Energy Progress applied to the NRC for a COL for two Westinghouse Electric AP1000 reactors at Harris. On May 2, 2013, Duke Energy Progress requested the NRC to suspend its review activities associated with the COL. As a result of the decision to suspend the COL applications, Duke Energy Progress recorded a pretax impairment charge of $22 million during the second quarter of 2013. This charge represents costs associated with the COL, which are not probable of recovery. On September 16, 2013 and January 30, 2014, respectively, the NCUC and PSCSC approved the deferral of the respective retail portion of the COL costs. Approximately $47 million is recorded in Regulatory assets on Duke Energy Progress Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2013.
Wholesale Depreciation Rates On April 19, 2013, Duke Energy Progress filed an application with FERC for acceptance of changes to generation depreciation rates and in August filed for acceptance of additional changes. These changes will affect the rates of Duke Energy Progress wholesale power customers that purchase or will purchase power under formula rates. Certain Duke Energy Progress wholesale customers filed interventions and protests. FERC accepted the depreciation rate changes, subject to refund, and set the matter for settlement and hearing in a consolidated proceeding. FERC further initiated an action with respect to the justness and reasonableness of the proposed rate changes. Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
Duke Energy Florida FPSC Settlement Agreements On February 22, 2012, the FPSC approved a settlement agreement (the 2012 Settlement) among Duke Energy Florida, the Florida Office of Public Counsel (OPC) and other customer advocates. The 2012 Settlement was to continue through the last billing cycle of December 2016. The agreement addressed four principal matters: (i) the Crystal River Unit 3 delamination prudence review then pending before the FPSC, (ii) certain customer rate matters, (iii) Duke Energy Floridas proposed Levy cost recovery, and (iv) cost of removal reserve.
On October 17, 2013, the FPSC approved a settlement agreement (the 2013 Settlement) between Duke Energy Florida, OPC, and other customer advocates. The 2013 Settlement replaces and supplants the 2012 Settlement and substantially resolves additional issues, including (i) matters related to Crystal River Unit 3, (ii) Levy, (iii) Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units, and (iv) future generation needs in Florida.
Refer to the remaining sections below for further discussion of these settlement agreements.
Crystal River Unit 3 In September 2009, Crystal River Unit 3 began an outage for normal refueling and maintenance as well as an uprate project to increase its generating capability and to replace two steam generators. During preparations to replace the steam generators, workers discovered a delamination, or separation, within the concrete at the periphery of the containment building, which resulted in an extension of the outage. The concrete delamination was caused by redistribution of stresses in the containment wall that occurred when an opening was created to accommodate the replacement of the units steam generators. In March 2011, work to return the plant to service was suspended after monitoring equipment identified a new delamination. The second delamination occurred in a different section of the outer wall after repair work was completed and during the late stages of retensioning the containment building. Crystal River Unit 3 remained out of service while Duke Energy Florida conducted an engineering analysis and review of the second delamination and evaluated possible repair options.
Subsequent to March 2011, monitoring equipment detected additional changes and further damage in the partially tensioned containment building. Duke Energy Florida developed a repair plan, which had a preliminary cost estimate of $900 million to $1.3 billion.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) On February 5, 2013, following the completion of a comprehensive analysis and an independent review by Zapata Incorporated, which estimated repair costs to be between $1.49 billion and $3.43 billion depending on the repair scope selected, Duke Energy Florida announced its intention to retire Crystal River Unit 3. Duke Energy Florida concluded it did not have a high degree of confidence the repair could be successfully completed and licensed within estimated costs and schedule, and that it was in the best interests of Duke Energy Floridas customers and joint owners, and Duke Energys investors to retire the unit. On February 20, 2013, Duke Energy Florida filed with the NRC a certification of permanent cessation of power operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel. In December 2013, Duke Energy Florida filed an updated site-specific decommissioning study and plan with the NRC and FPSC. The study resulted in a decommissioning cost estimate of $1,180 million, including amounts applicable to joint owners, under the safe storage (SAFSTOR) option. Duke Energy Floridas decommissioning study assumes Crystal River Unit 3 will be in SAFSTOR configuration, requiring limited staffing to monitor plant conditions, until the eventual dismantling and decontamination activities occur in 60 years.
This decommissioning approach is currently utilized at a number of retired domestic nuclear power plants and is one of three generally accepted approaches to decommissioning approved by the NRC.
Duke Energy Florida maintains insurance coverage through Nuclear Electric Insurance Limiteds (NEIL) accidental property damage program on an actual cash value basis. The NEIL coverage generally does not include property damage to or resulting from the containment structure. However, coverage does apply to decontamination and debris removal if required following an accident to ensure public health and safety or if property damage results from a terrorism event.
Duke Energy Florida worked with NEIL for recovery of applicable repair costs and associated replacement power costs throughout the duration of the Crystal River Unit 3 outage. On April 25, 2013, NEIL paid Duke Energy Florida $530 million related to the Crystal River Unit 3 delaminations. Duke Energy Florida has received a total of $835 million in insurance proceeds from NEIL related to the Crystal River Unit 3 delaminations. Duke Energy Florida recorded a regulatory liability of $490 million upon receipt of the April 2013 NEIL settlement proceeds. This amount is being refunded to retail customers through Duke Energy Floridas fuel clause. Proceeds received from NEIL and the related refunds to retail customers are presented in Operating Activities on Duke Energy Floridas Statements of Cash Flows.
The 2013 Settlement resolves substantially all remaining issues in the FPSC proceeding related to the review of Duke Energy Floridas decision to retire Crystal River Unit 3, the mediated resolution of insurance claims with NEIL, and the costs spent to repair Crystal River Unit 3; the uprate project; and the components of the regulatory asset to be recovered in rates beginning no later than 2017 via a separate base rate component.
As a result of retiring the unit, Duke Energy Florida is required to refund $100 million to retail customers through its fuel clause in accordance with the 2012 Settlement (retirement decision refund). Duke Energy Florida recorded a Regulatory liability in the third quarter of 2012 related to these replacement power obligations.
Duke Energy Florida has reclassified all Crystal River Unit 3 investments, including property, plant and equipment, nuclear fuel, inventory, and other assets to a regulatory asset. The 2012 Settlement authorized Duke Energy Florida to defer the retail portion of all Crystal River Unit 3-related costs incurred subsequent to retirement including, but not limited to, operations and maintenance and property tax costs in a regulatory asset. A regulatory liability must also be established to capture the difference between (i) actual incurred operations and maintenance and property tax costs in a given year and, (ii) the amount included in customer rates as established in Duke Energy Floridas most recent fully litigated base rate proceeding, effective 2010. Beginning in February 2013, the retail portion of operations and maintenance costs, payroll taxes, property taxes, and depreciation associated with Crystal River Unit 3 were deferred to a regulatory asset. Duke Energy Florida deferred $134 million of these costs to Regulatory assets through December 31, 2013. The 2013 Settlement terminates the regulatory asset and/or liability treatment for operation and maintenance and property tax expenses incurred after December 31, 2013.
Duke Energy Florida agreed to forego recovery of $295 million of Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory assets in accordance with the 2013 Settlement. This excludes amounts related to the uprate project. Duke Energy Florida recorded a $295 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2013 for this matter. This amount is included in Impairment charges on Duke Energy Floridas Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
Duke Energy Florida is allowed to accelerate cash recovery of approximately $130 million of the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset from retail customers from 2014 through 2016 through its fuel clause. Duke Energy Florida will begin recovery of the remaining Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset, up to a cap of $1,466 million from retail customers upon the earlier of (i) full recovery of the uncollected Levy investment or (ii) the first billing period of January 2017. Recovery will continue 240 months from inception of collection of the regulatory asset in base rates. The Crystal River Unit 3 base rate component will be adjusted at least every four years. Included in this recovery, but not subject to the cap, are costs of building a dry cask storage facility for spent nuclear fuel. The return rate will be based on the currently approved AFUDC rate with a return on equity of 7.35 percent, or 70 percent of the currently approved 10.5 percent. The return rate is subject to change if the return on equity changes in the future. Construction of the dry cask storage facility is subject to separate FPSC approval. The regulatory asset associated with the uprate project will continue to be recovered through the Nuclear Cost Recovery Clause (NCRC) over an estimated seven-year period beginning in 2013.
Through December 31, 2013, Duke Energy Florida deferred $1,310 million for rate recovery related to Crystal River Unit 3, which is subject to the rate recovery cap in the 2013 Settlement. In addition, Duke Energy Florida deferred $323 million for recovery costs associated with building a dry cask storage facility and the original uprate project, which is not subject to the rate recovery cap discussed above. Duke Energy Florida does not expect the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset to exceed the cap prior to full cash recovery from its retail customers.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Duke Energy Florida is a party to a master participation agreement and other related agreements with the joint owners of Crystal River Unit 3, which convey certain rights and obligations on Duke Energy Florida and the joint owners. In December 2012, Duke Energy Florida reached an agreement with one joint owner and extended a settlement offer to the other joint owner related to all Crystal River Unit 3 matters. Duke Energy Florida recorded a charge of $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the December 2012 settlement and settlement offer. In January 2014, Duke Energy Florida reached an agreement in principle with the remaining joint owner regarding resolution of matters associated with Crystal River Unit 3 based on condition precedents that must be met in order to carry out the agreement. Duke Energy Florida recorded a charge of $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to the January 2014 agreement. The significant majority of these amounts were included in Operations, maintenance and other on the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
Customer Rate Matters Pursuant to the 2013 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida will maintain base rates at the current level through the last billing period of 2018, subject to the return on equity range of 9.5 percent to 11.5 percent, with exceptions for base rate increases for the recovery of the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset beginning no later than 2017 and base rate increases for new generation through 2018, per the provisions of the 2013 Settlement. Duke Energy Florida is not required to file a depreciation study, fossil dismantlement study or nuclear decommissioning study until the earlier of the next rate case filing or March 31, 2019. The 2012 Settlement provided for a $150 million increase in base revenue effective with the first billing cycle of January 2013. Costs associated with Crystal River Unit 3 investments were removed from retail rate base effective with the first billing cycle of January 2013. Duke Energy Florida is accruing, for future rate-setting purposes, a carrying charge on the Crystal River Unit 3 investment until the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset is recovered in base rates. If Duke Energy Floridas retail base rate earnings fall below the return on equity range, as reported on a FPSC-adjusted or pro-forma basis on a monthly earnings surveillance report, it may petition the FPSC to amend its base rates during the term of the 2013 Settlement.
Duke Energy Florida is refunding $288 million to retail customers through its fuel clause, as required by the 2012 Settlement.
Levy On July 28, 2008, Duke Energy Florida applied to the NRC for a COL for two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at Levy. Various parties filed a joint petition to intervene in the Levy COL application. On March 26, 2013, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board issued a ruling that the NRC had carried its burden of demonstrating its Final Environmental Impact Statement complies with the National Environmental Policy Act and applicable NRC regulatory requirements.
In 2008, the FPSC granted Duke Energy Floridas petition for an affirmative Determination of Need and related orders requesting cost recovery under Floridas nuclear cost-recovery rule, together with the associated facilities, including transmission lines and substation facilities.
Under the terms of the 2012 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida began retail cost recovery of Levy costs effective in the first billing cycle of January 2013 at the fixed rates contained in the settlement and continuing for a five-year period, with true-up of any actual costs not recovered during the five-year period occurring in the final year. This amount is intended to recover the estimated retail project costs to date including costs necessary to obtain the COL and any engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) agreement cancellation costs. The 2012 Settlement provided that Duke Energy Florida will treat the allocated wholesale cost of Levy as a retail regulatory asset and include this asset as a component of rate base and amortization expense for regulatory reporting. The consumer parties agree to not oppose Duke Energy Florida continuing to pursue a COL for Levy.
On January 28, 2014, Duke Energy Florida terminated the EPC.
Duke Energy Florida may be required to pay for work performed under the EPC and to bring existing work to an orderly conclusion, including but not limited to, costs to demobilize and cancel certain equipment and material orders placed.
Duke Energy Florida is allowed to recover reasonable and prudent EPC cancellation costs from its retail customers. If Duke Energy Florida, at its own discretion, decides not to pursue the COL prior to March 31, 2015, it agrees to credit customers $10 million as a reduction to fuel costs.
In accordance with the 2013 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida ceased amortization of the wholesale allocation of Levy investments against retail rates. In the second quarter of 2013, Duke Energy Florida recorded a pretax charge of $65 million to write-off the wholesale portion of Levy investments. This amount is included in Impairment charges on the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
Recovery of the remaining retail portion of the project costs will occur over five years from 2013 through 2017. Duke Energy Florida has an ongoing responsibility to demonstrate prudency related to the wind down of the Levy investment and the potential for salvage of Levy assets. As of December 31, 2013, Duke Energy Florida has a net uncollected investment in Levy of approximately $264 million, including AFUDC. Of this amount, $50 million is included in Regulatory assets, $117 million related to land and the COL is included in Net, property, plant and equipment, and $97 million is included in Regulatory assets within Current Assets on the Balance Sheets.
Crystal River 1 and 2 Coal Units Duke Energy Florida has evaluated Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units for retirement in order to comply with certain environmental regulations. Based on this evaluation, those units will likely be retired by 2018. Once those units are retired Duke Energy Florida will continue recovery of existing annual depreciation expense through the end of 2020. Beginning in 2021, Duke Energy Florida will be allowed to recover any remaining net book value of the assets from retail customers through the Capacity Cost Recovery Clause.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC to allow for the recovery of prudently incurred costs to comply with the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard through the Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
New Generation Duke Energy Florida currently projects a significant need for additional generation to offset the impact of retirement of Crystal River Unit 3 as well as the possible retirement of Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units. The 2013 Settlement establishes a recovery mechanism for additional generation needs. This recovery mechanism, the Generation Base Rate Adjustment (GBRA), will apply to (i) the construction, uprate of existing generation, and/or purchase of up to 1,150 MW of combustion turbine and/or combined cycle generating capacity prior to the end of 2017, and (ii) the construction of additional generation of up to 1,800 MW to be placed in service in 2018 upon FPSC approval of a need determination. The GBRA allows recovery of prudent costs of these items through an increase in base rates, upon the in-service date of such assets, without a general rate case at a 10.5 percent return on equity. On October 8, 2013, Duke Energy Florida issued a request for proposals to evaluate alternatives for an additional generation facility. Duke Energy Florida is currently reviewing bids received on December 9, 2013.
Cost of Removal Reserve The 2012 Settlement and the 2013 Settlement provide Duke Energy Florida the discretion to reduce cost of removal amortization expense up to the balance in the cost of removal reserve until the earlier of its applicable cost of removal reserve reaches zero or the expiration of the 2013 Settlement. Duke Energy Florida may not reduce amortization expense if the reduction would cause it to exceed the appropriate high point of the return on equity range. Duke Energy Florida recognized a reduction in amortization expense of $114 million, $178 million, and $250 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 respectively. Duke Energy Florida had no cost of removal reserves eligible for amortization to income remaining at December 31, 2013.
Duke Energy Ohio Capacity Rider Filing On August 29, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio applied to the PUCO for the establishment of a charge for capacity provided pursuant to its obligations as a Fixed Resource Requirement (FRR) entity. The charge, which is consistent with Ohios state compensation mechanism, is estimated to be approximately $729 million, and reflects Duke Energy Ohios embedded cost of capacity. On February 13, 2014, the PUCO denied Duke Energy Ohios request.
2012 Electric Rate Case On May 1, 2013, the PUCO approved a settlement agreement (the Electric Settlement) related to Duke Energy Ohios electric distribution rate case. All intervening parties signed the Electric Settlement. The Electric Settlement provides for a net increase in electric distribution revenues of $49 million, or an average increase of 2.9 percent, based upon a return on equity of 9.84 percent. Revised rates were effective in May 2013.
2012 Natural Gas Rate Case On April 2, 2013, Duke Energy Ohio, the PUCO Staff, and intervening parties filed a settlement (the Gas Settlement) with the PUCO related to a gas distribution case. The Gas Settlement provides for no increase in base rates for gas distribution service. The Gas Settlement left unresolved the recovery of environmental remediation costs associated with former manufactured gas plants (MGP). The Gas Settlement is based upon a return on equity of 9.84 percent.
On November 13, 2013, the PUCO issued an order approving the Gas Settlement and allowing for the recovery of $56 million of MGP costs, excluding carrying costs, to be recovered over a five-year period beginning in 2014. On February 19, 2014, the PUCO denied intervening consumer groups motion to stay implementation of its order, or, in the alternative, to implement the MGP rider subject to refund. Intervening groups have provided notice of their intent to appeal the PUCOs decision to the Ohio Supreme Court. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
Generation Asset Transfer On April 2, 2012 and amended on June 22, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio and various affiliated entities filed an Application for Authorization for Disposition of Jurisdictional Facilities with FERC. The application seeks to transfer, from Duke Energy Ohios rate-regulated Ohio utility company, the legacy coal-fired and combustion gas turbine assets to a nonregulated affiliate, consistent with the ESP stipulation approved by the PUCO on November 22, 2011. The application outlines a potential additional step in the reorganization that would result in a transfer of all of Duke Energy Ohios Commercial Power business to an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy. The process of determining the optimal corporate structure is an ongoing evaluation of factors, such as tax considerations, that may change between now and the transfer date. In conjunction with the transfer, Duke Energy Ohios capital structure will be restructured to reflect appropriate debt and equity ratios for its regulated operations. The transfer could instead be accomplished within a wholly owned nonregulated subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio depending on final tax structuring analysis. The FERC approved the application on September 5, 2012. Duke Energy Ohio agreed to transfer the legacy coal-fired and combustion gas turbine assets on or before December 31, 2014.
Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) Realignment Duke Energy Ohio including Duke Energy Kentucky, transferred control of its transmission assets from MISO to PJM , effective December 31, 2011.
On December 22, 2010, the KPSC approved Duke Energy Kentuckys request to effect the RTO realignment, subject to a commitment not to seek double-recovery in a future rate case of the transmission expansion fees that may be charged by MISO and PJM in the same period or overlapping periods.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) On May 25, 2011, the PUCO approved a settlement between Duke Energy Ohio, Ohio Energy Group, The Office of Ohio Consumers Counsel and the PUCO Staff related to Duke Energy Ohios recovery of certain costs of the RTO realignment via a non-bypassable rider. Duke Energy Ohio is allowed to recover all MISO Transmission Expansion Project (MTEP) costs, including but not limited to Multi-Value Project (MVP) costs, directly or indirectly charged to Duke Energy Ohio retail customers. Duke Energy Ohio will not recover any portion of the MISO exit obligation, PJM integration fees, or internal costs associated with the RTO realignment, and the first $121 million of PJM transmission expansion costs from Ohio retail customers. Duke Energy Ohio also agreed to vigorously defend against any charges for MVP projects from MISO.
Upon its exit from MISO on December 31, 2011, Duke Energy Ohio recorded a liability for its exit obligation and share of MTEP costs, excluding MVP. This liability was recorded within Other in Current liabilities and Other in Deferred credits and other liabilities on Duke Energy Ohios Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of Duke Energy Ohios recorded obligations related to its withdrawal from MISO.

MVP.
MISO approved 17 MVP proposals prior to Duke Energy Ohios exit from MISO on December 31, 2011. Construction of these projects is expected to continue through 2020. Costs of these projects, including operating and maintenance costs, property and income taxes, depreciation and an allowed return, are allocated and billed to MISO transmission owners.
On December 29, 2011, MISO filed a tariff with the FERC providing for the allocation of MVP costs to a withdrawing owner based on monthly energy usage. The FERC set for hearing (i) whether MISOs proposed cost allocation methodology to transmission owners who withdrew from MISO prior to January 1, 2012 is consistent with the tariff at the time of their withdrawal from MISO, and, (ii) if not, what amount of, and methodology for calculating any MVP cost responsibility should be. On July 16, 2013, a FERC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued an initial decision. Under this initial decision, Duke Energy Ohio would be liable for MVP costs. Duke Energy Ohio filed exceptions to the initial decision, requesting the FERC overturn the ALJs decision. After reviewing the initial decision, along with all exceptions and responses filed by the parties, the FERC will issue a final decision. Duke Energy Ohio fully intends to appeal to the federal court of appeals if the FERC affirms the ALJs decision. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.
In 2012, MISO estimated Duke Energy Ohios MVP obligation over the period from 2012 to 2071 at $2.7 billion, on an undiscounted basis. The estimated obligation is subject to great uncertainty including the ultimate cost of the projects, the annual costs of O&M, taxes and return over the project lives and the allocation to Duke Energy Ohio.
Duke Energy Indiana Edwardsport IGCC Plant On November 20, 2007, the IURC granted Duke Energy Indiana a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) for the construction of a 618 MW IGCC power plant at Duke Energy Indianas existing Edwardsport Generating Station in Knox County, Indiana with a cost estimate of $1.985 billion assuming timely recovery of financing costs related to the project. On January 25, 2008, Duke Energy Indiana received the final air permit from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. The Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Inc., Sierra Club, Inc., Save the Valley, Inc., and Valley Watch, Inc., all intervenors in the CPCN proceeding (collectively, the Joint Intervenors), appealed the air permit. A settlement related to the air permit was reached on August 30, 2013. The air permit was not impacted by the provisions of the settlement.
Duke Energy Indiana experienced design modifications, quantity increases and scope growth above what was anticipated from the preliminary engineering design, which increased capital costs for the project. As a result, the projected cost estimate increased throughout construction of the project and various revised estimates were filed with the IURC. In October 2012, Duke Energy Indiana revised its latest projected cost estimate to $3.15 billion (excluding AFUDC).
On December 27, 2012, the IURC approved a settlement agreement (2012 Edwardsport settlement) related to the cost increase for the construction of the project, including subdockets before the IURC related to the project. The Office of Utility Consumer Counselor ( OUCC), the Duke Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Nucor Steel-Indiana were parties to the settlement. This settlement agreement resolved all then pending regulatory issues related to the project. The settlement agreement, as approved, capped costs to be reflected in customer rates at $2.595 billion, including estimated AFUDC through June 30, 2012. Duke Energy Indiana is allowed to recover AFUDC after June 30, 2012, until customer rates are revised, with such recovery decreasing to 85 percent on AFUDC accrued after November 30, 2012.
Duke Energy Indiana also agreed not to request a retail electric base rate increase prior to March 2013, with rates in effect no earlier than April 1, 2014.
The IURC modified the 2012 Edwardsport settlement as previously agreed to by the parties to (i) require Duke Energy Indiana to credit customers for cost control incentive payments the IURC found to be unwarranted as a result of delays that arose from project cost overruns and (ii) provide that if Duke Energy Indiana should recover more than the project costs absorbed by Duke Energys shareholders through litigation, any surplus must be returned to the Duke Energy Indianas ratepayers.
Over the course of construction of the project, Duke Energy Indiana recorded pretax charges of approximately $897 million related to the Edwardsport project, including the settlement agreement discussed above.
Of this amount, pretax impairment and other charges of $631 million were recorded duringthe year ended December 31, 2012.
These charges were recorded in Impairment charges and Operations, maintenance and other on Duke Energy Indianas Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) The Joint Intervenors appealed the IURC order approving the 2012 Edwardsport settlement and other related regulatory orders to the Indiana Court of Appeals. A final decision is anticipated mid-2014.
The project was placed in commercial operation in June 2013. Costs for the Edwardsport IGCC plant are recovered from retail electric customers via a tracking mechanism, the IGCC Rider.
Other Regulatory Matters Merger Appeals On January 9, 2013, the City of Orangeburg and NC WARN appealed the NCUCs approval of the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy. On April 29, 2013, the NCUC granted Duke Energys motion to dismiss certain exceptions contained in NC WARNs appeal. On November 6, 2013, the North Carolina Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on the appeals. A decision from the North Carolina Court of Appeals is pending.
Progress Energy Merger FERC Mitigation In June 2012, the FERC approved the merger with Progress Energy, including Duke Energy and Progress Energys revised market power mitigation plan, the Joint Dispatch Agreement (JDA) and the joint Open Access Transmission Tariff. The revised market power mitigation plan provides for the acceleration of one transmission project and the completion of seven other transmission projects (Long-term FERC Mitigation) and interim firm power sale agreements during the completion of the transmission projects (Interim FERC Mitigation). The Long-term FERC Mitigation is expected to increase power imported into the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress service areas and enhance competitive power supply options in the service areas. These projects are expected to be completed in 2014. On August 8, 2012, FERC granted certain intervenors request for rehearing for further consideration.
Following the closing of the merger, outside counsel reviewed Duke Energys mitigation plan and discovered a technical error in the calculations.
On December 6, 2013, Duke Energy submitted a filing with the FERC disclosing the error and arguing that no additional mitigation is necessary. On February 4, 2014, The City of New Bern, North Carolina filed comments to Duke Energys filing. Duke Energys response to New Bern was filed on February 19, 2014.
Duke Energy cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
Planned and Potential Coal Plant Retirements The Subsidiary Registrants periodically file Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) with their state regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of forecasted energy needs over a 10-20 year period, and options being considered to meet those needs. The IRPs filed by the Subsidiary Registrants in 2013, 2012 and 2011 included planning assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating facilities in South Carolina, Florida, Indiana and Ohio earlier than their current estimated useful lives. The facilities do not have the requisite emission control equipment, primarily to meet EPA regulations that are not yet effective.
The table below contains the net carrying value of generating facilities planned for early retirement or being evaluated for potential retirement included in Property, plant and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(b) Includes Lee Units 1 and   2. Excludes 170 MW Lee Unit 3 that is expected to be converted to gas in   2014. Duke Energy Carolinas expects to retire or convert these units by   December 2020 in conjunction with a settlement agreement associated with the   Cliffside Unit 6 air permit.
(c) Includes Crystal River   Units 1 and 2.
(d) Includes Beckjord Units 4   through 6 and Miami Fort Unit 6. 150 MW Beckjord Station Unit 4 was retired   on February 17, 2014. Beckjord units have no remaining book value.
(e) Includes Wabash River   Units 2 through 6. Wabash River Unit 6 is being evaluated for potential   conversion to gas. Duke Energy Indiana committed to retire or convert these   units by June 2018 in conjunction with a settlement agreement associated with   the Edwardsport air permit.
Duke Energy continues to   evaluate the potential need to retire these coal-fired generating facilities   earlier than the current estimated useful lives, and plans to seek regulatory   recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise recovered when any of these   assets are retired. However, such recovery, including recovery of carrying   costs on remaining book values, could be subject to future regulatory   approvals and therefore cannot be assured.
5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES General Insurance The Duke Energy Registrants have insurance and reinsurance coverage either directly or through indemnification from Duke Energys captive insurance company, Bison, and its affiliates, consistent with companies engaged in similar commercial operations with similar type properties. The Duke Energy Registrants coverage includes (i) commercial general liability coverage for liabilities arising to third parties for bodily injury 135 PART II DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION - DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC -  PROGRESS ENERGY, INC.
DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, INC.  DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, INC. - DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC.  - DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, INC.
Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) and property damage; (ii) workers compensation; (iii) automobile liability coverage; and (iv) property coverage for all real and personal property damage. Real and personal property damage coverage excludes electric transmission and distribution lines, but includes damages arising from boiler and machinery breakdowns, earthquakes, flood damage and extra expense, but not outage or replacement power coverage. All coverage is subject to certain deductibles or retentions, sublimits, exclusions, terms and conditions common for companies with similar types of operations.
The Duke Energy Registrants self-insure their electric transmission and distribution lines against loss due to storm damage and other natural disasters. As discussed further in Note 4, Duke Energy Florida maintains a storm damage reserve and has a regulatory mechanism to recover the cost of named storms on an expedited basis.
The cost of the Duke Energy Registrants coverage can fluctuate year to year reflecting claims history and conditions of the insurance and reinsurance markets.
In the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance and reinsurance available might not be adequate to cover claims and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the extent losses may exceed limits of the coverage available.
Nuclear Insurance Duke Energy Carolinas owns and operates the McGuire Nuclear Station (McGuire) and the Oconee Nuclear Station (Oconee) and operates and has a partial ownership interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station (Catawba). McGuire and Catawba each have two reactors. Oconee has three reactors. The other joint owners of Catawba reimburse Duke Energy Carolinas for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per the Catawba joint owner agreements.
Duke Energy Progress owns and operates the Robinson Nuclear Station (Robinson) and operates and has a partial ownership interest in the Brunswick Nuclear Station (Brunswick) and Harris. Robinson and Harris each have one reactor. Brunswick has two reactors. The other joint owners of Brunswick and Harris reimburse Duke Energy Progress for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per the Brunswick and Harris joint owner agreements.
Duke Energy Florida manages and has a partial ownership interest in Crystal River Unit 3, which has been retired. The other joint owners of Crystal River Unit 3 reimburse Duke Energy Florida for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per the Crystal River Unit 3 joint owner agreement.
In the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a material effect on Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Floridas results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the extent losses may exceed limits of the coverage available.
Nuclear Liability Coverage The Price-Anderson Act requires owners of nuclear reactors to provide for public nuclear liability protection per nuclear incident up to a maximum total financial protection liability. The maximum total financial protection liability increased to a total of $13.6 billion. This amount is adjusted every five years for an inflationary provision. Total nuclear liability coverage consists of a combination of private primary nuclear liability insurance coverage and a mandatory industry risk-sharing program to provide for excess nuclear liability coverage above the maximum reasonably available private primary coverage.
The United States Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims.
Primary Liability Insurance Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have purchased the maximum reasonably available private primary nuclear liability insurance as required by law, which currently is $375 million per station.
Excess Liability Program This program provides $13.2 billion of coverage per incident through the Price-Anderson Acts mandatory industry-wide excess secondary financial protection program of risk pooling. This amount is the product of potential cumulative retrospective premium assessments of $127 million times the current 104 licensed commercial nuclear reactors in U.S. Under this program, licensees could be assessed retrospective premiums to compensate for public nuclear liability damages in the event of a nuclear incident at any licensed facility in the U.S. Retrospective premiums may be assessed at a rate not to exceed $19 million per year per licensed reactor for each incident. The assessment may be subject to state premium taxes.
Nuclear Property Coverage Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are members of NEIL, which provides insurance coverage for nuclear facilities under three policy programs: the primary property insurance program, the excess property insurance program and the accidental outage insurance program.
Pursuant to regulations of the NRC, each companys property damage insurance policies provide that all proceeds from such insurance be applied, first, to place the plant in a safe and stable condition after a qualifying accident, and second, to decontaminate the plant before any proceeds can be used for decommissioning, plant repair or restoration.
Losses resulting from non-certified acts of terrorism are covered as common occurrences, such that if non-certified terrorist acts occur against one or more commercial nuclear power plants insured by NEIL within a 12-month period, they would be treated as one event and the owners 136 PART II DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION - DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC -  PROGRESS ENERGY, INC.
DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, INC.  DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, INC. - DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC.  - DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, INC.
Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) of the plants where the act occurred would share one full limit of liability. The full limit of liability is currently $3.2 billion. NEIL sublimits the total aggregate for all of their policies for non-nuclear terrorist events to approximately $1.83 billion.
Primary Property Insurance This policy provides $500 million of primary property damage coverage. The deductible per occurrence is $3 million for Catawba, and $10 million for the remaining nuclear facilities. This policy also has a 10 percent deductible provision excess of these deductibles for natural catastrophe damage.
Excess Property Insurance This policy provides excess property, decontamination and decommissioning liability insurance of $2.25 billion for Catawba, $750 million each for Oconee, McGuire, Brunswick, Harris and Robinson; and $560 million for Crystal River Unit 3. All nuclear facilities except for Catawba and Crystal River Unit 3 also share an additional $1 billion insurance limit above their dedicated underlying excess. This shared additional excess limit is not subject to reinstatement in the event of a loss.
Crystal River Unit 3s primary and excess property insurance is on an actual cash value basis. NEIL coverage does not include property damage to or resulting from the containment structure except coverage does apply to decontamination and debris removal, if required following an accident, to ensure public health and safety or if property damage results from a terrorism event.
NEIL sublimits property damage losses to $1.5 billion for non-nuclear accidental property damage.
Accidental Outage Insurance This policy provides replacement power ex p ense coverage r esulting from an accidental prope rt y damage out a ge of a nuclear unit. Coverage amounts decrease in the event more than one unit at a station is out of service due to a common accident. Initial coverage begins after a 12-week deductible period. Coverage continues at 100 percent of the weekly limits for 52 weeks and 80 percent of the weekly limits for the next 110 weeks.
The Catawba units are insured for up to $4 million per week. The McGuire units are insured for up to $4 million per week. The Oconee units are insured for up to $3 million per week. The Brunswick units are insured for up to $3 million per week. The Harris unit is insured for up to $3 million per week. The Robinson unit is insured for up to $2 million per week.
The accidental outage policy limit is $490 million for McGuire and Catawba, $378 million for Oconee, $406 million for Brunswick, $364 million for Harris, and $308 million for Robinson.
NEIL sublimits the accidental outage recovery to the first 104 weeks of coverage not to exceed $328 million from non-nuclear accidental property damage.
Potential Retroactive Premium Assessments In the event of NEIL losses, NEILs board of directors may assess member companies retroactive premiums of amounts up to 10 times their annual premiums for up to six years after a loss. The current potential maximum assessments for Duke Energy Carolinas are $42 million for primary property insurance, $36 million for excess property insurance and $29 million for accidental outage insurance. The current potential maximum assessments for Duke Energy Progress are $33 million for primary property insurance, $32 million for excess property insurance and $14 million for accidental outage insurance. The current potential maximum assessments for Duke Energy Florida are $6 million for primary property insurance and $4 million for excess property insurance.
The maximum assessment amounts include 100 percent of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, and Duke Energy Floridas potential obligations to NEIL for their share of jointly owned reactors. However, the other joint owners of the jointly owned reactors are obligated to assume their pro rata share of liability for retrospective premiums and other premium assessments resulting from the Price-Anderson Acts excess secondary financial protection program of risk pooling, or from the NEIL policies.
ENVIRONMENTAL Duke Energy is subject to international, federal, state, and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, and other environmental matters. The Subsidiary Registrants are subject to federal, state, and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time, imposing new obligations on the Duke Energy Registrants.
The following environmental matters impact all of the Duke Energy Registrants.
Remediation Activities The Duke Energy Registrants are responsible for environmental remediation at various contaminated sites. These include some properties that are part of ongoing operations and sites formerly owned or used by Duke Energy entities. These sites are in various stages of investigation, remediation, and monitoring. Managed in conjunction with relevant federal, state, and local agencies, activities vary with site conditions and locations, remediation requirements, complexity, and sharing of responsibility. If remediation activities involve joint and several liability provisions, strict liability, or cost recovery or contribution actions, the Duke Energy Registrants could potentially be held responsible for contamination caused by other potentially responsible parties, and may also benefit from insurance policies or contractual indemnities that cover some or all cleanup costs. Liabilities are recorded when losses become probable and are reasonably estimable. The total costs that may be incurred cannot be estimated because the extent of environmental impact, allocation among potentially responsible parties, remediation alternatives, and/or regulatory decisions has not yet been determined. Additional costs associated with remediation activities are likely to be incurred in the future and could be significant. Costs are typically expensed as Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations unless regulatory recovery of the costs is deemed probable.

(in millions) Duke Energy $ 74 Duke Energy Carolinas 29 Progress Energy 5 Duke Energy Progress 2 Duke Energy Florida 3 Duke Energy Ohio 35 Duke Energy Indiana 5 Regulations Clean Water Act 316(b) The EPA proposed a cooling water intake structures rule on April 20, 2011. The proposed rule advances one main approach and three alternatives. Based on the main approach proposed, most, if not all of the steam electric generating facilities the Duke Energy Registrants own are likely affected sources unless retired prior to implementation of the 316(b) requirements.
The revised deadline for issuance of the final 316(b) rule is April 17, 2014. If the rule is finalized as proposed, modifications to affected power plant cooling water intake structures could be required by mid-to-late 2017. The Duke Energy Registrants are unable to predict the outcome of this rulemaking, but the impact could be significant.
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) On August 8, 2011, the final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) was published in the Federal Register. The CSAPR established state-level annual SO 2 budgets and annual seasonal NO x budgets that were to take effect on January 1, 2012.
On August 21, 2012, the D.C. Circuit Court vacated the CSAPR. The court also directed the EPA to continue administering the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). The CAIR requires additional reductions in SO 2 and NO x emissions beginning in 2015. On June 24, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court (Supreme Court) granted the EPAs petitions for a writ of certiorari. The Supreme Court is likely to issue its decision on the merits by mid-2014.
The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings. Continued compliance with CAIR pending the outcome of the rehearing process will not result in the Duke Energy Registrants adding new emission controls.
Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) On June 21, 2010, the EPA proposed a regulation under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, related to CCR or coal combustion byproducts associated with the generation of electricity. The EPA proposal contains two regulatory options whereby CCRs not employed in approved beneficial use applications would either (i) be regulated as hazardous waste or (ii) continue to be regulated as non-hazardous waste.
On October 29, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia directed the EPA to provide the Court, within 60 days of the Order, a proposed schedule for completing the CCR rulemaking. On January 29, 2014, the EPA filed a consent decree agreeing to issue the final rule by December 19, 2014. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of this rulemaking, but the impact could be significant.
Steam Electric Effluent Limitation Guidelines On June 7, 2013, the EPA proposed Steam Electric Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELGs). The EPA is under a court order to finalize the rule by May 22, 2014. The EPA has proposed eight options for the rule, which vary in stringency and cost. The proposed regulation applies to seven waste streams, including wastewater from air pollution control equipment and ash transport water. Most, if not all of the steam electric generating facilities the Duke Energy Registrants own are likely affected sources. Compliance is proposed as soon as possible after July 1, 2017, but may extend until July 1, 2022. The Duke Energy Registrants are unable to predict the outcome of the rulemaking, but the impact could be significant.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Greenhouse Gas New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) On January 8, 2014, the EPA proposed a rule to establish carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions standards for new pulverized coal, IGCC, natural gas combined cycle, and simple cycle electric generating units commencing construction on or after the date the proposal appears in the Federal Register. Future coal and IGCC units will be required to employ carbon capture and storage technology to meet the proposed standard.
The Duke Energy Registrants do not expect a material impact on their future results of operations or cash flows based on the EPAs proposal. The final rule, however, could be significantly different from the proposal. It is not known when the EPA might finalize the rule.
On June 25, 2013, the President of the United States issued a memorandum directing the EPA to propose CO 2 emissions requirements for existing fossil-fueled electric generating units by June 1, 2014, and to finalize the guidelines for states to develop their own regulations for implementing the guidelines by June 1, 2015. The memorandum directed the EPA to require states to submit their implementation regulations for approval by June 30, 2016.
The Duke Energy Registrants are unable to predict the outcome of this rulemaking, but the impact could be significant.
Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) The final MATS rule, previously referred to as the Utility MACT Rule, was issued on February 16, 2012. The final rule establishes emission limits for hazardous air pollutants from new and existing coal-fired and oil-fired steam electric generating units. The rule requires sources to comply with emission limits by April 16, 2015. Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), permitting authorities have the discretion to grant up to a one-year compliance extension, on a case-by-case basis, to sources that are unable to complete the installation of emission controls before the compliance deadline. Strategies to achieve compliance with the final rule will include installing new air emission control equipment, developing monitoring processes, fuel switching, and accelerating retirement of some coal-fired electric-generating units. For additional information, refer to Note 4 regarding potential plant retirements.
Several petitions for review of the final rule were filed with the D.C. Circuit Court. A decision is expected in the first half of 2014. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of the litigation or how it might affect their compliance with the MATS requirements.
Refer to the table below for a summary of estimated costs to comply with the MATS regulations.
Estimated Cost and Impacts of EPA Rulemakings The ultimate compliance requirements for MATS, Clean Water 316(b), CCRs and ELGs will not be known until all the rules have been finalized. For planning purposes, the Duke Energy Registrants currently estimate the cost of new control equipment that may need to be installed on existing power plants to comply with these EPA regulations could total $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, excluding AFUDC, over the next 10 years. The table below includes estimated costs for new control equipment necessary to comply with the MATS rule, which is the only rule that has been finalized.

The actual compliance costs incurred may be materially different from these estimates based on the timing and requirements of the final EPA regulations. The Duke Energy Registrants intend to seek rate recovery of amounts incurred associated with regulated operations in complying with these regulations. Refer to Note 4 for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants.
Litigation Duke Energy Dan River Ash Basin Release On February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke Energy Carolinas retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe stopping the release of materials into the river. Duke Energy Carolinas estimates 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash and 24 million to 27 million gallons of basin water were released into the river. Duke Energy Carolinas continues to work with local and state officials responding to this event. On February 10, 2014, Duke Energy received a subpoena for the production of documents, issued by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina in connection with a criminal investigation related to the release. A second subpoena was issued by the same United States Attorney on February 18, 2014, which expanded the document production to cover all fourteen of the North Carolina facilities with coal ash ponds.
It is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy will incur any liability or to estimate the damages, if any, it might incur in connection with these matters.

The plaintiffs allege federal Securities Act and Exchange Act claims based on allegations of materially false and misleading representations and omissions in the Registration Statement filed on July 7, 2011, and purportedly incorporated into other documents, all in connection with the post-merger change in CEO. The claims are purportedly brought on behalf of a class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Duke Energy securities between June 11, 2012 and July 9, 2012. On July 26, 2013, the Magistrate Judge recommended the District Court Judge deny the defendants motion to dismiss. On October 2, 2013, the District Judge heard defendants objections to this recommendation. A decision is pending on the motion to dismiss.
It is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy will incur any liability or to estimate the damages, if any, it might incur in connection with these lawsuits.
Alaskan Global Warming Lawsuit On February 26, 2008, the governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska, filed suit in the U.S. Federal Court for the Northern District of California against various defendants including Duke Energy. On May 20, 2013, the plaintiffs Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court was denied, ending the case.
Price Reporting Cases A total of five lawsuits were filed against Duke Energy affiliates and other energy companies and remain pending in a consolidated, single federal court proceeding in Nevada.
Each of these cases contain similar claims, that defendants allegedly manipulated natural gas markets by various means, including providing false information to natural gas trade publications and entering into unlawful arrangements and agreements in violation of the antitrust laws of the respective states. Plaintiffs seek damages in unspecified amounts.
On July 19, 2011, the judge granted a defendants motion for summary judgment in two of the remaining five cases to which Duke Energy affiliates are a party. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit subsequently reversed the lower courts decision.

Brazil Expansion Lawsuit On August 9, 2011, the State of So Paulo sued Duke Energy International Geracao Paranapenema S.A. (DEIGP) in Brazilian state court. The lawsuit claims DEIGP is under a continuing obligation to expand installed generation capacity in the State of So Paulo by 15 percent pursuant to a stock purchase agreement under which DEIGP purchased generation assets from the state. On August 10, 2011, a judge granted an ex parte injunction ordering DEIGP to present a detailed expansion plan in satisfaction of the 15 percent obligation. DEIGP has previously taken a position the expansion obligation is no longer viable given changes that have occurred in the electric energy sector since privatization. DEIGP submitted its proposed expansion plan on November11, 2011, but reserved objections regarding enforceability. No trial date has been set.

Duke Energy Carolinas New Source Review (NSR) In 1999-2000, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) on behalf of the EPA filed a number of complaints and notices of violation against multiple utilities, including Duke Energy Carolinas, for alleged violations of the NSR provisions of the CAA. The government alleges the utilities violated the CAA by not obtaining permits for certain projects undertaken at certain coal plants or installing the best available emission controls for SO 2 , NO x and particulate matter. The complaints seek the installation of pollution control technology on various generating units that allegedly violated the CAA, and unspecified civil penalties in amounts of up to $37,500 per day for each violation. Duke Energy Carolinas asserts there were no CAA violations because the applicable regulations do not require permitting in cases where the projects undertaken are routine or otherwise do not result in a net increase in emissions.
In 2000, the government sued Duke Energy Carolinas in the U.S. District Court in Greensboro, North Carolina. The EPA claims 29 projects performed at 25 of Duke Energy Carolinas coal-fired units violate the NSR provisions. Duke Energy Carolinas asserts the projects were routine or not projected to increase emissions. The parties filed a stipulation in which the United States dismissed with prejudice 16 claims. In exchange, Duke Energy Carolinas dismissed certain affirmative defenses. The parties filed opposing motions for summary judgment on the remaining claims. In November 2013, the Court denied Duke Energys motion for summary judgment. A decision on the DOJs motion for summary judgment remains pending. Duke Energy requested leave to file another motion for summary judgment on alternative grounds. That motion for leave, as well as the Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, remains pending.
It is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy Carolinas will incur any liability or to estimate the damages, if any, it might incur in connection with this matter. Ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Duke Energy Carolinas. However, the appropriate regulatory recovery will be pursued for costs incurred in connection with such resolution.
Asbestos-related Injuries and Damages Claims Duke Energy Carolinas has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost reimbursement related to asbestos exposure. These claims relate to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted on its electric generation plants prior to 1985. As of December 31, 2013, there were 96 asserted claims for non-malignant cases with the cumulative relief sought of up to $24 million, and 31 asserted claims for malignant cases with the cumulative relief sought of up to $11 million. Based on Duke Energy Carolinas experience, it is expected that the ultimate resolution of most of these claims likely will be less than the amount claimed.
Duke Energy Carolinas has recognized asbestos-related reserves of $616 million at December 31, 2013 and $751 million at December 31, 2012. These reserves are classified in Other within Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities and Other within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These reserves are based upon the minimum amount of the range of loss for current and future asbestos claims through 2033, are recorded on an undiscounted basis and incorporate anticipated inflation. It is possible Duke Energy Carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves.
Duke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention of $476 million. Duke Energy Carolinas cumulative payments began to exceed the self-insurance retention in 2008. Future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. The insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries indemnification and medical cost claim payments is $897 million in excess of the self-insured retention. Receivables for insurance recoveries were $649 million at December 31, 2013 and $781 million at December 31, 2012. These amounts are classified in Other within Investments and Other Assets and Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Duke Energy Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Duke Energy Carolinas believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating.
Progress Energy Synthetic Fuels Matters Progress Energy and a number of its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants in lawsuits arising out of a 1999 Asset Purchase Agreement. Parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement include U.S. Global, LLC (Global) and affiliates of Progress Energy.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) In a case filed in the Circuit Court for Broward County, Florida, in March 2003 (the Florida Global Case), Global requested an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, as well as declaratory relief. In November 2009, the court ruled in favor of Global. In December 2009, Progress Energy made a $154 million payment, which represented payment of the total judgment, including prejudgment interest, and a required premium equivalent to two years of interest, to the Broward County Clerk of Court bond account. Progress Energy continued to accrue interest related to this judgment.
On October 3, 2012, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeals reversed the lower court ruling. The court held that Global was entitled to approximately $90 million of the amount paid into the registry of the court. Progress Energy was entitled to a refund of the remainder of the funds. Progress Energy received cash and recorded a $63 million pretax gain for the refund in December 2012. The gain was recorded in Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
On May 9, 2013, Global filed a Seventh Amended Complaint asserting a single count for breach of the Asset Purchase Agreement and seeking specific performance. A trial is scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 2014.
In a second suit filed in the Superior Court for Wake County, N.C., Progress Synfuel Holdings, Inc. et al. v. U.S. Global, LLC (the North Carolina Global Case), the Progress Energy Affiliates seek declaratory relief consistent with their interpretation of the Asset Purchase Agreement. In August 2003, the Wake County Superior Court stayed the North Carolina Global Case, pending the outcome of the Florida Global Case. Based upon the verdict in the Florida Global Case, Progress Energy anticipates dismissal of the North Carolina Global Case.
Progress Energy does not expect the resolution of these matters to have a material effect on it results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida Spent Nuclear Fuel Matters On December 12, 2011, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida sued the United States in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The lawsuit claims the DOE breached a contract in failing to accept spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and asserts damages for the cost of on-site storage. Claims for all periods prior to 2006 have been resolved. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida assert damages of $84 million and $21 million, respectively, for the period January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2010. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida may file subsequent damage claims as they incur additional costs. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
Duke Energy Ohio Antitrust Lawsuit In January 2008, four plaintiffs, including individual, industrial and nonprofit customers, filed a lawsuit against Duke Energy Ohio in federal court in the Southern District of Ohio. Plaintiffs alleged Duke Energy Ohio conspired to provide inequitable and unfair price advantages for certain large business consumers by entering into non-public option agreements in exchange for their withdrawal of challenges to Duke Energy Ohios Rate Stabilization Plan (RSP) implemented in early 2005. A ruling is pending on the plaintiffs motion to certify this matter as a class action. It is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy Ohio will incur any liability or to estimate the damages which may be incurred in connection with this lawsuit.
Asbestos-related Injuries and Damages Claims Duke Energy Ohio has been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits related to asbestos exposure at its electric generating stations. The impact on Duke Energy Ohios results of operations, cash flows or financial position of these cases to date has not been material. Based on estimates under varying assumptions concerning uncertainties, such as, among others: (i) the number of contractors potentially exposed to asbestos during construction or maintenance of Duke Energy Ohio generating plants, (ii) the possible incidence of various illnesses among exposed workers, and (iii) the potential settlement costs without federal or other legislation that addresses asbestos tort actions, Duke Energy Ohio estimates that the range of reasonably possible exposure in existing and future suits over the foreseeable future is not material. This assessment may change as additional settlements occur, claims are made, and more case law is established.
Duke Energy Indiana Edwardsport IGCC On December 11, 2012, Duke Energy Indiana filed an arbitration action against General Electric Company and Bechtel Corporation in connection with their work at the Edwardsport IGCC facility. Duke Energy Indiana is seeking damages of not less than $560 million. An arbitration hearing is scheduled for October 2014. Duke Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
Other Litigation and Legal Proceedings The Duke Energy Registrants are involved in other legal, tax and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve significant amounts. The Duke Energy Registrants believe the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material effect on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
The table below presents recorded reserves based on managements best estimate of probable loss for legal matters discussed above and the associated insurance recoveries. The reasonably possible range of loss for all non-asbestos related matters in excess of recorded reserves is not material.

The Duke Energy Registrants have the ability under certain debt facilities to call and repay the obligation prior to its scheduled maturity. Therefore, the actual timing of future cash repayments could be materially different than as presented above.
Short-term Obligations Classified as Long-term Debt Tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Company at the option of the holder and certain commercial paper issuances and money pool borrowings are classified as Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These tax-exempt bonds, commercial paper issuances and money pool borrowings, which are short-term obligations by nature, are classified as long term due to Duke Energys intent and ability to utilize such borrowings as long-term financing. As Duke Energys master credit facility and other bilateral letter of credit agreements have non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of the balance sheet date, Duke Energy has the ability to refinance these short-term obligations on a long-term basis.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Available Credit Facilities Duke Energy has a master credit facility with a capacity of $6 billion through December 2018. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy each have borrowing capacity under the master credit facility up to specified sublimits for each borrower. Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower. The amount available under the master credit facility has been reduced to backstop the issuances of commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder. The table below includes the current borrowing sublimits and available capacity under the master credit facility.

The Duke Energy Ohio sublimit includes   $100 million for Duke Energy Kentucky.
(b) Duke Energy issued $450   million of commercial paper and loaned the proceeds through the money pool to   Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Indiana. The balances are classified as   long-term borrowings within Long-term Debt in Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke   Energy Indiana's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Other Debt Matters In September 2013, Duke Energy filed a registration statement (Form S-3) with the SEC. Under this Form S-3, which is uncapped, the Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. The registration statement also allows for the issuance of common stock by Duke Energy.
Duke Energy has an effective Form S-3 with the SEC to sell up to $3 billion of variable denomination floating-rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. The Form S-3 states that no more than $1.5 billion of the notes will be outstanding at any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Duke Energy or at the investors option at any time. The balance as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $836 million and $395 million, respectively. The notes are short-term debt obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as Notes payable and commercial paper on Duke Energys Consolidated Balance Sheets.
At December 31, 2013 and 2012, $811 million and $734 million, respectively, of debt issued by Duke Energy Carolinas was guaranteed by Duke Energy.
Money Pool The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy receive support for their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. Under this arrangement, those companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating in this arrangement. The money pool is structured such that the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy separately manage their cash needs and working capital requirements. Accordingly, there is no net settlement of receivables and payables between money pool participants. Duke Energy (Parent), may loan funds to its participating subsidiaries, but may not borrow funds through the money pool. Accordingly, as the money pool activity is between Duke Energy and its wholly owned subsidiaries, all money pool balances are eliminated within Duke Energys Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Money pool receivable balances are reflected within Notes receivable from affiliated companies on the respective Subsidiary Registrants Consolidated Balance Sheets. Money pool payable balances are reflected within either Notes payable to affiliated companies or Long-term debt payable to affiliated companies on the respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Restrictive Debt Covenants The Duke Energy Registrants debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. The master credit facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio not exceed 65 percent for each borrower. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of December 31, 2013, each of the Duke Energy Registrants were in compliance with all covenants related to its significant debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the significant debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) During 2013 and 2012, Duke Energy and Duke Energy Progress had loans outstanding against the cash surrender value of life insurance policies it owns on the lives of its executives. The amounts outstanding were $571 million, including $48 million at Duke Energy Progress and $496 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The amounts outstanding were carried as a reduction of the related cash surrender value that is included in Other within Investments and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
7. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS Duke Energy and Progress Energy have various financial and performance guarantees and indemnifications, which are issued in the normal course of business. As discussed below, these contracts include performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. Duke Energy and Progress Energy enter into these arrangements to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties by enhancing the value of the transaction to the third party. At December 31, 2013, Duke Energy and Progress Energy do not believe conditions are likely for significant performance under these guarantees. To the extent liabilities are incurred as a result of the activities covered by the guarantees, such liabilities are included on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
On January 2, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas businesses to shareholders. Guarantees issued by Duke Energy or its affiliates, or assigned to Duke Energy prior to the spin-off, remained with Duke Energy subsequent to the spin-off. Guarantees issued by Spectra Energy Capital, LLC, formerly known as Duke Capital LLC, (Spectra Capital) or its affiliates prior to the spin-off remained with Spectra Capital subsequent to the spin-off, except for guarantees that were later assigned to Duke Energy. Duke Energy has indemnified Spectra Capital against any losses incurred under certain of the guarantee obligations that remain with Spectra Capital. At December 31, 2013, the maximum potential amount of future payments associated with these guarantees was $205 million, the majority of which expires by 2028.
Duke Energy has issued performance guarantees to customers and other third parties that guarantee the payment and performance of other parties, including certain non-wholly owned entities, as well as guarantees of debt of certain non-consolidated entities and less than wholly owned consolidated entities. If such entities were to default on payments or performance, Duke Energy would be required under the guarantees to make payments on the obligations of the less than wholly owned entity. The maximum potential amount of future payments required under these guarantees as of December 31, 2013, was $285 million. Of this amount, $15 million relates to guarantees issued on behalf of less than wholly owned consolidated entities, with the remainder related to guarantees issued on behalf of third parties and unconsolidated affiliates of Duke Energy. Of the guarantees noted above, $102 million of the guarantees expire between 2015 and 2033, with the remaining performance guarantees having no contractual expiration.
Duke Energy has guaranteed certain issuers of surety bonds, obligating itself to make payment upon the failure of a wholly owned and former non-wholly owned entity to honor its obligations to a third party. Under these arrangements, Duke Energy has payment obligations that are triggered by a draw by the third party or customer due to the failure of the wholly owned or former non-wholly owned entity to perform according to the terms of its underlying contract. At December31, 2013, Duke Energy had guaranteed $92 million of outstanding surety bonds. Of this amount, $54 million, expire in 2014, the remaining expires between 2015  2021.
At December 31, 2013, Duke Energy had $457 million of unused bank-issued stand-by letters of credit to secure the performance of wholly owned and non-wholly owned entities to a third party or customer.
Duke Energy and Progress Energy has issued indemnifications for certain asset performance, legal, tax and environmental matters to third parties, including indemnifications made in connection with sales of businesses. At December 31, 2013, the estimated maximum exposure for these indemnifications was $117 million, the majority of which expires in 2017. Of this amount, $7 million has no contractual expiration. For certain matters for which Progress Energy receives timely notice, indemnity obligations may extend beyond the notice period. Certain indemnifications related to discontinued operations have no limitations as to time or maximum potential future payments.
The following table includes the liabilities recognized for the guarantees discussed above. These amounts are primarily recorded in Other within Deferred Credits and other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As current estimates change, additional losses related to guarantees and indemnifications to third parties, which could be material, may be recorded by the Duke Energy Registrants in the future. The decrease in 2013 was mainly due the expiration of guarantees. Accruals and expenditures were not material.

Joint Ownership of Generating and Transmission Facilities The Duke Energy Registrants hold ownership interests in certain jointly owned generating and transmission facilities. The Duke Energy Registrants are entitled to shares of the generating capacity and output of each unit equal to their respective ownership interests. The Duke Energy Registrants pay their ownership share of additional construction costs, fuel inventory purchases and operating expenses, except in certain instances where agreements have been executed to limit certain joint owners maximum exposure to the additional costs. The Duke Energy Registrants share of revenues and operating costs of the jointly owned generating facilities is included within the corresponding line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Each participant in the jointly owned facilities must provide its own financing, except in certain instances where agreements have been executed to limit certain joint owners maximum exposure to the additional costs.

Asset Retirement Obligations Asset retirement obligations recognized by Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida relate primarily to decommissioning nuclear power facilities, asbestos removal and closure of landfills at fossil generation facilities. Asset retirement obligations at Duke Energy Ohio relate primarily to the retirement of gas mains, asbestos removal and closure of landfills at fossil generation facilities. Asset retirement obligations at Duke Energy Indiana relate primarily to obligations associated with asbestos removal and closure of landfills at fossil generation facilities. Duke Energy also has asset retirement obligations related to the removal of renewable energy generation assets in addition to the above items. Certain of the Duke Energy Registrants assets have an indeterminate life, such as transmission and distribution facilities, and thus the fair value of the retirement obligation is not reasonably estimable. A liability for these asset retirement obligations will be recorded when a fair value is determinable.
The following table presents changes in the liability associated with asset retirement obligations.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) The Duke Energy Registrants regulated operations accrue costs of removal for property that does not have an associated legal retirement obligation based on regulatory orders from state commissions. These costs of removal are recorded as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting treatment. The Duke Energy Registrants do not accrue the estimated cost of removal for any nonregulated assets. See Note 4 for the estimated cost of removal for assets without an associated legal retirement obligation, which are included in Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Nuclear Decommissioning Costs Use of the NDTF investments are restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities. The NDTF investments are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, FERC, NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The fair value of assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations associated with nuclear decommissioning are $4,769 million and $2,477 million for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas at December 31, 2013, respectively, and $3,941 million and $2,053 million for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas at December 31, 2012, respectively. The NDTF balances for Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida represent the fair value of assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations associated with nuclear decommissioning. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require updated cost estimates for decommissioning nuclear plants every five years.

Impairment Analysis As the fair values of the reporting units of Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Ohio exceeded their respective carrying values at the date of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, no impairment charges were recorded.
In addition, at December 31, 2013, goodwill for the Renewables reporting unit within Commercial Power was analyzed for impairment primarily as a result of the expiration of wind production tax credits at the end of 2013. Based on results of the fourth quarter 2013 impairment analysis, the fair value of the Renewables reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment was recorded. The fair value of the Renewables reporting unit is impacted by a multitude of factors, including legislative actions related to tax credit extensions, long-term growth rate assumptions, the market price of power and discount rates. Management continues to monitor these assumptions for any indicators that the fair value of the reporting unit could be below the carrying value, and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate.

As further discussed in Note 5, CSAPR established state-level annual SO 2 and NO x caps that were required to take effect on January 1, 2012, and state-level ozone-season NO x caps that were to take effect on May 1, 2012. CSAPR did not utilize CAA emission allowances as the original CAIR provided. Under CSAPR, the EPA was expected to issue new emission allowances to be used exclusively for purposes of complying with CSAPR cap-and-trade program. After this ruling was published in 2011, Duke Energy evaluated the effect of CSAPR on the carrying value of emission allowances recorded at its Regulated Utilities and Commercial Power segments. Based on the provisions of CSAPR, Duke Energy Ohio had more SO 2 allowances than were needed to comply with the continuing CAA acid rain cap-and-trade program (excess emission allowances). Duke Energy Ohio incurred a pretax impairment of $79 million in 2011 to write down the carrying value of excess emission allowances held by Commercial Power to fair value. The charge is recorded in Goodwill and other impairment charges on Duke Energy Ohios Consolidated Statements of Operations. This amount was based on the fair value of excess allowances held by Commercial Power for compliance under the continuing CAA acid rain cap-and-trade program as of September 30, 2011.

Corporate   governance and other shared services costs are primarily related to human   resources, employee benefits, legal and accounting fees, as well as other   third-party costs. These amounts are recorded in Operation, maintenance and   other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.   See Note 21 for additional information.
(b) The Subsidiary Registrants incur expenses related to certain   indemnification coverages through Bison, Duke Energys wholly owned captive   insurance subsidiary. These expenses are recorded in Operation, maintenance   and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive   Income.
(c) Effective with the consummation of the merger between Duke   Energy and Progress Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress   began to participate in a JDA. The JDA allows the collective dispatch of   power plants between service territories to reduce customer rates.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) In addition to the amounts presented above, the Subsidiary Registrants record the impact on net income of other affiliate transactions, including rental of office space, participation in a money pool arrangement, other operational transactions and their proportionate share of certain charged expenses. See Note 6 for more information regarding money pool. The net impact of these transactions was not material for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 for the Subsidiary Registrants.
As discussed in Note 17, certain trade receivables have been sold by Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana to CRC, an affiliate formed by a subsidiary of Duke Energy. The proceeds obtained from the sales of receivables are largely cash but do include a subordinated note from CRC for a portion of the purchase price.
In January 2012, Duke Energy Ohio recorded a non-cash equity transfer of $28 million related to the sale of Vermilion to Duke Energy Indiana. Duke Energy Indiana recorded a non-cash after-tax equity transfer of $26 million for the purchase of Vermillion from Duke Energy Ohio. See Note 2 for further discussion.
Duke Energy Commercial Asset Management (DECAM) is a nonregulated, direct subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio. DECAM conducts business activities including the execution of commodity transactions, third-party vendor and supply contracts, and service contracts for certain of Duke Energys nonregulated entities. The commodity contracts DECAM enters are accounted for as undesignated contracts or NPNS. Consequently, mark-to-market impacts of intercompany contracts with, and sales of power to, nonregulated entities are reflected in Duke Energy Ohios Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. These amounts totaled net expense of $6 million and net revenue of $24 million and $18 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Because it is not a rated entity, DECAM receives its credit support from Duke Energy or its nonregulated subsidiaries and not the regulated utility operations of Duke Energy Ohio. DECAM meets its funding needs through an intercompany loan agreement from a subsidiary of Duke Energy. DECAM also has the ability to loan money to the subsidiary of Duke Energy. DECAM had an outstanding intercompany loan payable of $43 million and $79 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. This amount is recorded in Notes payable to affiliated companies on Duke Energy Ohios Consolidated Balance Sheets.

DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, INC.  DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, INC. - DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC.  - DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, INC.
Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) The Duke Energy Registrants use commodity and interest rate contracts to manage commodity price and interest rate risks. The primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against changes in the prices of electricity and natural gas. Interest rate swaps are used to manage interest rate risk associated with borrowings.
All derivative instruments not identified as NPNS are recorded at fair value as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral related to derivative instruments executed under master netting agreement is offset against the collateralized derivatives on the balance sheet.
Changes in the fair value of derivative agreements that either do not qualify for or have not been designated as hedges are reflected in current earnings or as regulatory assets or liabilities.
Commodity Price Risk The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the impact of changes in the future prices of electricity, coal, and natural gas. Exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors including the term of contracts, the liquidity of markets, and delivery locations.
Commodity Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges At December 31, 2013, there were no open commodity derivative instruments designated as hedges.
Undesignated Contracts Undesignated contracts may include contracts not designated as a hedge, contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, derivatives that do not or no longer qualify for the NPNS scope exception, and de-designated hedge contracts. These contracts expire as late as 2018.
Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have entered into firm power sale agreements, which are accounted for as derivatives, as part of the Interim FERC Mitigation in connection with Duke Energys merger with Progress Energy. See Note 2 for further information. Duke Energy Carolinas undesignated contracts are primarily associated with forward sales and purchases of electricity. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Floridas undesignated contracts are primarily associated with forward purchases of natural gas. Duke Energy Ohios undesignated contracts are primarily associated with forward sales and purchases of electricity, coal, and natural gas. Duke Energy Indianas undesignated contracts are primarily associated with forward purchases and sales of electricity and financial transmission rights.
Volumes The tables show information relating to the volume of the outstanding commodity derivatives. Amounts disclosed represent the notional volumes of commodity contracts excluding NPNS. Amounts disclosed represent the absolute value of notional amounts. The Duke Energy Registrants have netted contractual amounts where offsetting purchase and sale contracts exist with identical delivery locations and times of delivery. Where all commodity positions are perfectly offset, no quantities are shown .

Interest Rate Risk The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of their issuance or anticipated issuance of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Interest rate risk is managed by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring changes in interest rates. To manage risk associated with changes in interest rates, the Duke Energy Registrants may enter into interest rate swaps, U.S. Treasury lock agreements, and other financial contracts. In anticipation of certain fixed-rate debt issuances, a series of forward starting interest rate swaps may be executed to lock in components of current market interest rates. These instruments are later terminated prior to or upon the issuance of the corresponding debt. Pretax gains or losses recognized from inception to termination of the hedges are amortized as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt.
Duke Energy has a combination foreign exchange, pay fixed-receive floating interest rate swap to fix the US dollar equivalent payments on a floating-rate Chilean debt issue.

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities The Duke Energy Registrants classify their investments in debt and equity securities as either trading or available-for-sale.
TRADING SECURITIES Investments in debt and equity securities held in grantor trusts associated with certain deferred compensation plans and certain other investments are classified as trading securities. The fair value of these investments was $18 million as of December 31, 2013 and $33 million as of December 31, 2012.
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES All other investments in debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
Duke Energys available-for-sale securities are primarily comprised of investments held in (i) the NDTF at Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, (ii) grantor trusts at Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana related to OPEB plans, (iii) Duke Energys captive insurance investment portfolio, and (iv) Duke Energys foreign operations investment portfolio.
Duke Energy holds corporate debt securities that were purchased using excess cash from its foreign operations. These investments are classified as Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are available for current operations of Duke Energys foreign business. The fair value of these investments was $44 million as of December 31, 2013 and $333 million as of December 31, 2012.
Duke Energy classifies all other investments in debt and equity securities as non-current, unless otherwise noted .
NDTF and Grantor Trust The investments within the NDTF at Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida and the Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana grantor trusts (Investment Trusts) are managed by independent investment managers with discretion to buy, sell, and invest pursuant to the objectives set forth by the trust agreements. The Duke Energy Registrants have limited oversight of day-to-day management of these investments. As a result, the ability to hold investments in unrealized loss positions is outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants. Accordingly, all unrealized gains and losses associated with debt and equity securities within the Investment Trusts are considered other-than-temporary impairments and are recognized immediately. Pursuant to regulatory accounting, substantially all realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with investments within the Investment Trusts are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. As a result, there is no immediate impact on earnings of the Duke Energy Registrants.
Other Available for Sale Securities Unrealized gains and losses on all other available-for-sale securities are included in other comprehensive income until realized, unless it is determined the carrying value of an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the unrealized loss may be included in earnings based on the criteria discussed below.
The Duke Energy Registrants analyze all investment holdings each reporting period to determine whether a decline in fair value should be considered other-than-temporary. Criteria used to evaluate whether an impairment associated with equity securities is other-than-temporary includes, but is not limited to, (i) the length of time over which the market value has been lower than the cost basis of the investment, (ii) the percentage decline compared to the cost of the investment, and (iii) managements intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its fair value through a charge to earnings.
If the entity does not have an intent to sell a debt security and it is not more likely than not management will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its cost basis, the impairment write-down to fair value would be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, except for when it is determined a credit loss exists. In determining whether a credit loss exists, management considers, among other things, (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, (ii) changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset backed security, the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors, (iii) consideration of underlying collateral and guarantees of amounts by government entities, (iv) ability of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments, and (v) any changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies. If a credit loss exists, the amount of impairment write-down to fair value is split between credit loss and other factors. The amount related to credit loss is 169 PART II DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION - DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC -  PROGRESS ENERGY, INC.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is the exchange price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value definition focuses on an exit price versus the acquisition cost. Fair value measurements use market data or assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs may be readily observable, corroborated by market data, or generally unobservable. Valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize use of unobservable inputs. A midmarket pricing convention (the midpoint price between bid and ask prices) is permitted for use as a practical expedient.
Fair value measurements are classified in three levels based on the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date. An active market is one in which transactions for an asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide ongoing pricing information.
Level 2 A fair value measurement utilizing inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for an asset or liability. Inputs include (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, (iii) and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rate curves and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, and credit spreads. A Level 2 measurement cannot have more than an insignificant portion of its valuation based on unobservable inputs. Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives, such as over-the-counter forwards, swaps and options; certain marketable debt securities; and financial instruments traded in less than active markets.
Level 3 Any fair value measurement which includes unobservable inputs for more than an insignificant portion of the valuation. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in managements best estimate of fair value. Level 3 measurements may include longer-term instruments that extend into periods in which observable inputs are not available.
The fair value accounting guidance permits entities to elect to measure certain financial instruments that are not required to be accounted for at fair value, such as equity method investments or the companys own debt, at fair value. The Duke Energy Registrants have not elected to record any of these items at fair value.
Transfers between levels represent assets or liabilities that were previously (i) categorized at a higher level for which the inputs to the estimate became less observable or (ii) classified at a lower level for which the inputs became more observable during the period. The Duke Energy Registrants policy is to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the period. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. Transfers out of Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2013 are the result of forward commodity prices becoming observable due to the passage of time.
Valuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed below are as follows.
Investments in equity securities The majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1 measurements. Investments in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the quarter. Principal active markets for equity prices include 175 PART II DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION - DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC -  PROGRESS ENERGY, INC.
DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, INC.  DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, INC. - DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC.  - DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, INC.
Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) published exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE. Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. There was no after-hours market activity that was required to be reflected in the reported fair value measurements. Investments in equity securities that are Level 2 or 3 are typically ownership interests in commingled investment funds.
Investments in debt securities Most investments in debt securities are valued using Level 2 measurements because the valuations uses interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. If the market for a particular fixed income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3.
Commodity derivatives Commodity derivatives with clearinghouses are classified as Level 1. Other commodity derivatives are primarily fair valued using internally developed discounted cash flow models which incorporate forward price, adjustments for liquidity (bid-ask spread) and credit or non-performance risk (after reflecting credit enhancements such as collateral), and are discounted to present value. Pricing inputs are derived from published exchange transaction prices and other observable data sources. In the absence of an active market, the last available price may be used. If forward price curves are not observable for the full term of the contract and the unobservable period had more than an insignificant impact on the valuation, the commodity derivative is classified as Level 3. In isolation, increases (decreases) in natural gas forward prices result in favorable (unfavorable) fair value adjustments for gas purchase contracts; and increases (decreases) in electricity forward prices result in unfavorable (favorable) fair value adjustments for electricity sales contracts. Duke Energy regularly evaluates and validates pricing inputs used to estimate fair value of gas commodity contracts by a market participant price verification procedure. This procedure provides a comparison of internal forward commodity curves to market participant generated curves.
Interest rate derivatives Most over-the-counter interest rate contract derivatives are valued using financial models which utilize observable inputs for similar instruments and are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward interest rate curves, notional amounts, interest rates and credit quality of the counterparties.
Goodwill and long-lived assets See Note 11 for a discussion of the valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets.

17. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES A VIE is an entity that is evaluated for consolidation using more than a simple analysis of voting control. The analysis to determine whether an entity is a VIE considers contracts with an entity, credit support for an entity, the adequacy of the equity investment of an entity and the relationship of voting power to the amount of equity invested in an entity. This analysis is performed either upon the creation of a legal entity or upon the occurrence of an event requiring reevaluation, such as a significant change in an entitys assets or activities. A qualitative analysis of control determines the party that consolidates a VIE. This assessment is based on (i) what party has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE that impact its economic performance, and (ii) what party has rights to receive benefits or is obligated to absorb losses that are significant to the VIE. The analysis of the party that consolidates a VIE is a continual reassessment. Other than the discussion below related to CRC, no financial support was provided to any of the VIEs during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, or is expected to be provided in the future, that was not previously contractually required.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) The obligations of these VIEs are non-recourse to Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. These entities have no requirement to provide liquidity to purchase assets of, or guarantee performance of these VIEs unless noted in the following paragraphs.
DERF On a daily basis, Duke Energy Receivables Finance Company, LLC (DERF), a bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiary of Duke Energy Carolinas, buys certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity and/or related services from Duke Energy Carolinas. DERF is a wholly owned limited liability company with a separate legal existence from its parent, and its assets are not generally available to creditors of Duke Energy Carolinas. DERF borrows $400 million under a credit facility to buy the receivables. Borrowing is limited to the amount of qualified receivables sold, which is expected to be in excess of $400 million. The receivables are used as collateral for commercial paper issued through third parties. The credit facility expires in October 2016 and is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-term Debt. The secured credit facility was not structured to meet the criteria for sale accounting treatment under the accounting guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets.
The most significant activity that impacts the economic performance of DERF is the decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy Carolinas consolidates DERF as it makes those decisions.
DEPR On a daily basis, Duke Energy Progress Receivables Company, LLC (DEPR), a bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiary of Duke Energy Progress formed in 2013, buys certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity and/or related services from Duke Energy Progress. DEPR is a wholly owned limited liability company with a separate legal existence from its parent, and its assets are not generally available to creditors of Duke Energy Progress. DEPR borrows $300 million under a credit facility to buy the receivables. Borrowing is limited to the amount of qualified receivables sold, which is expected to be in excess of $300 million. The receivables are used as collateral for commercial paper issued through third parties. The credit facility expires in December 2016 and is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-term Debt. The secured credit facility was not structured to meet the criteria for sale accounting treatment under the accounting guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets.
The most significant activity that impacts the economic performance of DEPR is the decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy Progress consolidates DEPR as it makes those decisions.
CRC On a revolving basis, CRC buys certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity and/or related services from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. Receivables sold are securitized by CRC through a facility managed by two unrelated third parties and are used as collateral for commercial paper issued by the unrelated third parties. Proceeds Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana receive from the sale of receivables to CRC are typically 75 percent cash and 25 percent in the form of a subordinated note from CRC. The subordinated note is a retained interest in the receivables sold. Cash collections from the receivable are the sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligation. Depending on experience with collections, additional equity infusions to CRC may be required by Duke Energy to maintain a minimum equity balance of $3 million. There were no infusions to CRC during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2011, Duke Energy infused $6 million of equity to CRC to remedy net worth deficiencies. Borrowings fluctuate based on the amount of receivables sold. The credit facility expires in November 2016. The secured credit facility is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-term Debt. CRC is considered a VIE because (i) equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations, (ii) power to direct the most significant activities that impact economic performance of the entity are not performed by the equity holder, Cinergy, and (iii) deficiencies in net worth of CRC are not funded by Cinergy, but by Duke Energy. The most significant activity of CRC relates to the 184 PART II DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION - DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC -  PROGRESS ENERGY, INC.

CinCap V CinCap V was created to finance and execute a power sale agreement with Central Maine Power Company for approximately 35 MW of capacity and energy. This agreement expires in 2016. CinCap V is considered a VIE because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. Duke Energy consolidates CinCap V as it has power to direct the most significant activities that impact the economic performance of the entity, which are the decisions to hedge and finance the power sales agreement.
Renewables Certain of Duke Energys renewable energy facilities are VIEs due to power purchase agreements with terms that approximate the expected life of the projects. These fixed price agreements effectively transfer commodity price risk to the buyer of the power. Certain other of Duke Energys renewable energy facilities are VIEs due to Duke Energy issuing guarantees for debt service and operations and maintenance reserves in support of debt financings. Assets are restricted and cannot be pledged as collateral or sold to third parties without prior approval of debt holders. The most significant activities that impact the economic performance of these renewable energy facilities were decisions associated with siting, negotiating purchase power agreements, engineering, procurement and construction, and decisions associated with ongoing operations and maintenance-related activities. Duke Energy consolidated the entities as it makes all of these decisions.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Until December 31, 2013, Duke Energy owned a 50 percent ownership interest in DukeNet. DukeNet was considered a VIE because it has entered into certain contractual arrangements that provide it with additional forms of subordinated financial support. The most significant activities that impacted DukeNets economic performance relate to its business development and fiber optic capacity marketing and management activities. The power to direct these activities was jointly and equally shared by Duke Energy and the other joint venture partner.
On December 31, 2013, Duke Energy completed the sale of its ownership interest in DukeNet to Time Warner Cable, Inc. For more information on the sale of DukeNet, refer to Note 12.
Renewables Duke Energy has investments in various renewable energy project entities. Some of these entities are VIEs due to power purchase agreements with terms that approximate the expected life of the project. These fixed price agreements effectively transfer commodity price risk to the buyer of the power. Duke Energy does not consolidate these VIEs because power to direct and control key activities is shared jointly by Duke Energy and other owners.
FPC Capital I Trust At December 31, 2012, Progress Energy had variable interests in the FPC Capital I Trust (the Trust). The Trust, a finance subsidiary, was established for the sole purpose of issuing $300 million of 7.10% Cumulative QUIPS due 2039, and using the proceeds thereof to purchase $300 million of 7.10% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Notes due 2039 from Florida Progress Funding Corporation (Funding Corp.). Funding Corp. was formed for the sole purpose of providing financing to Duke Energy Florida. On February 1, 2013, Duke Energy redeemed the QUIPS and subsequently terminated the Trust.
Other The most significant of the Other non-consolidated VIEs is Duke Energy Ohios 9 percent ownership interest in OVEC. Through its ownership interest in OVEC, Duke Energy Ohio has a contractual arrangement to buy power from OVECs power plants through June 2040. Proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC to its power purchase agreement counterparties are designed to be sufficient to meet its operating expenses, fixed costs, debt amortization and, interest expense, as well as earn a return on equity. Accordingly, the value of this contract is subject to variability due to fluctuations in power prices and changes in OVECs costs of business, including costs associated with its 2,256 MW of coal-fired generation capacity. As discussed in Note 5, proposed environmental rulemaking could increase the costs of OVEC, which would be passed through to Duke Energy Ohio. The initial carrying value of this contract was recorded as an intangible asset when Duke Energy acquired Cinergy in April 2006. This amount is included in the table above for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Ohio.
In addition, Duke Energy has guaranteed performance of certain entities in which it no longer has an equity interest.
CRC See discussion under Consolidated VIEs for additional information related to CRC.
The subordinated notes held by Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are stated at fair value and are classified within Receivables in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. Carrying values of retained interests are determined by allocating carrying value of the receivables between assets sold and interests retained based on relative fair value. The allocated basis of the subordinated notes are not materially different than their face value because (i) the receivables generally turnover in less than two months, (ii) credit losses are reasonably predictable due to the broad customer base and lack of significant concentration, and (iii) the equity in CRC is subordinate to all retained interests and thus would absorb losses first. The hypothetical effect on fair value of the retained interests assuming both a 10 percent and a 20 percent unfavorable variation in credit losses or discount rates is not material due to the short turnover of receivables and historically low credit loss history. Interest accrues to Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana on the retained interests using the acceptable yield method. This method generally approximates the stated rate on the notes since the allocated basis and the face value are nearly equivalent. An impairment charge is recorded against the carrying value of both retained interests and purchased beneficial interest whenever it is determined that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred.
The following table shows the gross and net receivables sold.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Cash flows from the sale of receivables are reflected within Operating Activities on Duke Energy Ohios and Duke Energy Indianas Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Collection fees received in connection with the servicing of transferred accounts receivable are included in Operation, maintenance and other on Duke Energy Ohios and Duke Energy Indianas Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The loss recognized on sales of receivables is calculated monthly by multiplying the receivables sold during the month by the required discount. The required discount is derived monthly utilizing a three-year weighted-average formula that considers charge-off history, late charge history, and turnover history on the sold receivables, as well as a component for the time value of money. The discount rate, or component for the time value of money, is calculated monthly by summing the prior month-end LIBOR plus a fixed rate of 1.00 percent.
18. COMMON STOCK Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income attributable to Duke Energy common shareholders, adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Duke Energy common shareholders, as adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, by the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock, such as stock options, phantom shares and stock-based performance unit awards were exercised or settled. Duke Energys participating securities are restricted stock units that are entitled to dividends declared on Duke Energy common shares during the restricted stock units vesting period.
On July 2, 2012, just prior to the close of the merger with Progress Energy, Duke Energy executed a one-for-three reverse stock split. All earnings per share amounts included in this 10-K are presented as if the one-for-three reverse stock split had been effective January 1, 2011. The following table presents Duke Energys basic and diluted EPS calculations and reconciles the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding to the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
(In millions, except per-share amounts) Income Average   Shares EPS 2013 Income from continuing operations attributable to Duke Energy   common shareholders, as adjusted for participating securities  basic and   diluted $ 2,640 706 $ 3.74 2012 Income from continuing operations attributable to Duke Energy   common shareholders, as adjusted for participating securities  basic $ 1,727 574 $ 3.01 Effect of dilutive securities: Stock options, performance and restricted stock 1 Income from continuing operations attributable to Duke Energy   common shareholders, as adjusted for participating securities  diluted $ 1,727 575 $ 3.01 2011 Income from continuing operations attributable to Duke Energy   common shareholders, as adjusted for participating securities  basic and   diluted $ 1,702 444 $ 3.83 As of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, 2 million, 1million and 3million, respectively, of stock options and performance and unvested stock awards were not included in the dilutive securities calculation in the above table because either the option exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares during those periods, or performance measures related to the awards had not yet been met.
For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Duke Energy declared dividends of $3.09 per share, $3.03 per share and $2.97 per share, respectively.
19. SEVERANCE 2011 SEVERANCE PLAN In conjunction with the merger with Progress Energy, in November 2011 Duke Energy and Progress Energy offered a voluntary severance plan to certain eligible employees. As this was a voluntary severance plan, all severance benefits offered under this plan are considered special termination benefits under U.S. GAAP. Special termination benefits are measured upon employee acceptance and recorded immediately absent any significant retention period. If a significant retention period exists, the cost of the special termination benefits are recorded ratably over the retention period. Approximately 1,100 employees from Duke Energy and Progress Energy requested severance 187 PART II DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION - DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC -  PROGRESS ENERGY, INC.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) during the voluntary window, which closed on November 30, 2011. The estimated amount of future severance expense associated with this voluntary plan through 2014 are not material.
Additionally, in the third quarter of 2012, a voluntary severance plan was offered to certain unionized employees of Duke Energy Ohio. Approximately 75 employees accepted the termination benefits during the voluntary window, which closed on October 8, 2012. The expense associated with this plan was not material.
In conjunction with the retirement of Crystal River Unit 3, severance benefits have been made available to certain eligible impacted unionized and non-unionized employees, to the extent that those employees do not find job opportunities at other locations. Approximately 600 employees worked at Crystal River Unit 3. For the year ended December 31, 2013, Duke Energy Florida deferred $26 million of severance costs as a regulatory asset. Severance costs expected to be accrued over the remaining retention period for employees identified to have a significant retention period is not material. However, these employees maintain the ability to accept job opportunities at other Duke Energy locations, which would result in severance not being paid. If a significant amount of these individuals redeploy within Duke Energy, the final severance benefits paid under the plan may be less than what has been accrued to date. Refer to Note 4 for further discussion regarding Crystal River Unit 3.
Amounts included in the table below represent direct and   allocated severance and related expense recorded by the Duke Energy   Registrants, and are recorded in Operation, maintenance and other within   Operating Expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Duke   Energy Registrants recorded insignificant amounts for severance expense   during 2011 for past and ongoing severance plans.

20. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Duke Energys 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan) reserved 25 million shares of common stock for awards to employees and outside directors. Duke Energy has historically issued new shares upon exercising or vesting of share-based awards. However, Duke Energy may use a combination of new share issuances and open market repurchases for share-based awards that are exercised or become vested in the future. Duke Energy has not determined with certainty the amount of such new share issuances or open market repurchases.
The 2010 Plan allows for a maximum of 6.25 million shares of common stock to be issued under various stock-based awards other than options and stock appreciation rights.
In connection with the acquisition of Progress Energy in July 2012, Duke Energy assumed Progress Energys 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP). Stock-based awards granted under the Progress Energy EIP and held by Progress Energy employees were generally converted into outstanding Duke Energy stock-based compensation awards. The estimated fair value of these awards allocated to purchase price was $62 million. Refer to Note 2 for further information regarding the merger transaction.
The following table summarizes the total expense recognized by each of the Duke Energy Registrants, net of tax, for stock-based compensation.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) The total grant date fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $50 million, $34million and $19million, respectively. At December 31, 2013, Duke Energy had $21 million of unrecognized compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1 year and 9 months.
PERFORMANCE AWARDS Stock-based awards issued and outstanding generally vest over three years if performance targets are met.
Certain performance awards granted in 2013, 2012 and 2011 contain market conditions based on the total shareholder return (TSR) of Duke Energy stock relative to a pre-defined peer group (relative TSR). These awards are valued using a path-dependent model that incorporates expected relative TSR into the fair value determination of Duke Energys performance-based share awards. The model uses three-year historical volatilities and correlations for all companies in the pre-defined peer group, including Duke Energy, to simulate Duke Energys relative TSR as of the end of the performance period. For each simulation, Duke Energys relative TSR associated with the simulated stock price at the end of the performance period plus expected dividends within the period results in a value per share for the award portfolio. The average of these simulations is the expected portfolio value per share. Actual life to date results of Duke Energys relative TSR for each grant is incorporated within the model.
Other performance awards not containing market conditions were awarded in 2012 and 2011. The performance goal for these awards is Duke Energys return on equity over a three-year period. Awards are measured at grant date price.
The following table includes information related to performance awards.

At December 31, 2013, Duke Energy had $22 million of unrecognized compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1 year and 11 months.
21. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS DEFINED Benefit Retirement Plans Duke Energy maintains, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. The plans cover most U.S. employees using a cash balance formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage of current eligible earnings based on age and/or years of service and interest credits. Certain employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula. As of January 1, 2014, these defined benefit plans are closed to new participants. Under these average earnings formulas, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to the sum of percentages of their (i) highest three-year or four-year average earnings, (ii) highest three-year or four-year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation (maximum of 35 years), and/or (iii) highest three or four-year average earnings times years of 190 PART II DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION - DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC -  PROGRESS ENERGY, INC.

Duke Energy uses a December 31 measurement date for its defined benefit retirement plan assets and obligations.
Net periodic benefit costs disclosed in the tables below represent the cost of the respective benefit plan for the periods presented. However, portions of the net periodic benefit costs disclosed in the tables below have been capitalized as a component of property, plant and equipment. Amounts presented in the tables below for the Subsidiary Registrants represent the amounts of pension and other post-retirement benefit cost allocated by Duke Energy for employees of the Subsidiary Registrants. Additionally, the Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of pension and post-retirement benefit cost for employees of Duke Energys shared services affiliate that provide support to the Subsidiary Registrants. These allocated amounts are included in the governance and shared service costs discussed in Note 13.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Assumptions Used for Pension Benefits Accounting The discount rate used to determine the current year pension obligation and following years pension expense is based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plans projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.
The average remaining service period of active covered employees is nine years for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana and eight years for Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida.
The following tables present the assumptions used for pension benefit accounting. For Progress Energy plans, the assumptions used in 2012 to determine net periodic pension cost reflect remeasurement as of July 1, 2012, due to the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Assumptions Used for Other Post-Retirement Benefits Accounting The discount rate used to determine the current year other post-retirement benefits obligation and following years other post-retirement benefits expense is based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates present value of the plans projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.
The following tables present the assumptions used for other post-retirement benefits accounting. For Progress Energy plans, the assumptions used in 2012 to determine net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost reflect remeasurement as of July 1, 2012, due to the merger between Duke Energy and Progress Energy.

Combined Notes To  Consolidated Financial Statements  (Continued) Plan Assets Description and Allocations Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust Assets for both the qualified pension and other post-retirement benefits are maintained in the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust. Approximately 98 percent of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust assets were allocated to qualified pension plans and approximately 2 percent were allocated to other post-retirement plans, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. The investment objective of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust is to achieve reasonable returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants.
The asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their high expected return. Debt securities, hedge funds, real estate and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers or investments. Duke Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate.
Qualified pension and other post-retirement benefits for the Subsidiary Registrants are derived from the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust, as such, each are allocated their proportionate share of the assets discussed below.
The following table includes the target asset allocations by asset class at December 31, 2013 and the actual asset allocations for the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust.

The investment objective of VEBA I is to achieve sufficient returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants. VEBA I is passively managed .
The following table includes the weighted-average returns expected by asset classes and the target asset allocations at December 31, 2013 and the actual asset allocations for VEBA I.

Valuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed above are as follows: Investments in equity securities Investments in equity securities, other than those accounted for as equity and cost method investments, are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the reporting period. Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE. Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. Prices have not been adjusted to reflect after-hours market activity. The majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1 measurements. When (i) the Duke Energy Registrants lack the ability to redeem investments valued on a net asset value per share basis at net asset value per share in the near future or (ii) net asset value per share is not available at the measurement date, the fair value measurement of the investment is categorized as Level 3.
Investments in debt securities Most debt investments are valued based on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. Most debt valuations are Level 2 measurements. If the market for a particular fixed income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3. U.S. Treasury debt is typically Level 1.
Investments in short-term investment funds Investments in short-term investment funds are valued at the net asset value of units held at year end. Investments in short-term investment funds with published prices are valued as Level 1. Investments in short-term investment funds with unpublished prices are valued as Level 2.
Investments in real estate investment trusts Investments in real estate investment trusts are valued based upon property appraisal reports prepared by independent real estate appraisers. The Chief Real Estate Appraiser of the asset manager is responsible for assuring that the valuation process provides independent and reasonable property market value estimates. An external appraisal management firm not affiliated with the asset manager has been appointed to assist the Chief Real Estate Appraiser in maintaining and monitoring the independence and the accuracy of the appraisal process.

On July 23, 2013, HB 998 was signed into law. HB 998 reduces the North Carolina corporate income tax rate from a statutory 6.9 percent to 6.0 percent in January 2014 with a further reduction to 5.0 percent in January 2015. Duke Energy recorded a net reduction of approximately $145 million to its North Carolina deferred tax liability in the third quarter of 2013. The significant majority of this deferred tax liability reduction was offset by recording a regulatory liability pending NCUC determination of the disposition of the amounts related to Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The impact of HB 998 did not have a significant impact on the financial position, results of operation, or cash flows of Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy or Duke Energy Progress.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have evaluated their effectiveness of their disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2013, and, based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance of compliance.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013 and have concluded no change has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
Managements Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Duke Energy Registrants management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a15(f) and 15d15(f). The Duke Energy Registrants internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
The Duke Energy Registrants management, including their Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 based on the framework in the 1992 Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2013.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, Duke Energys independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Duke Energys internal control over financial reporting .
