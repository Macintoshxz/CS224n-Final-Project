GENERAL Airgas,Inc. and subsidiaries ("Airgas" or the "Company") is the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases (delivered in "packaged" or cylinder form), and welding, safety and related products ("hardgoods"). Airgas also produces dry ice, liquid carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and specialty gases for distribution throughout the United States. Airgas' integrated network of approximately 800 locations includes branches, retail stores, packaged gas fill plants, specialty gas labs, production facilities and distribution centers. Airgas also distributes its products and services to its diversified customer base through eBusiness, catalog and telemarketing channels. Sales were $1.64billion, $1.63billion, and $1.54billion in fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.
The Company's two operating segments are Distribution and Gas Operations. Financial information by business segment can be found in Item7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" ("MD&A"), and Note23 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Descriptions of the operating segments are as follows: DISTRIBUTION The Distribution segment accounts for approximately 90% of consolidated sales and reflects the distribution of industrial, medical and specialty gases, and hardgoods. The Distribution segment also includes the equity affiliate earnings related to the Company's investment in National Welders Supply Company,Inc., which is a producer and distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases and hardgoods.
Principal Products and Services The Distribution segment's principal products and services include packaged and small bulk gases, gas cylinder and welding equipment rental and hardgoods. Gas sales include industrial, medical and specialty gases such as: nitrogen, oxygen, argon, helium, acetylene, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, hydrogen, welding gases, ultra high purity grades and special application blends. Rent is derived from gas cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk storage tanks and through the rental of welding equipment. Gas and rent represented approximately 47%, 44%, and 42% of the Distribution segment's sales in each of the fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Hardgoods consist of welding supplies and equipment, safety products, and industrial tools and supplies. In each of the fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, hardgoods sales represented approximately 53%, 56%, and 58% of the Distribution segment's sales, respectively (see Note23 of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding segment sales).
Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution The Company believes the market for industrial, medical and specialty gases in the United States is approximately $9.4billion annually. The industry has three principal modes of distribution: on-site supply, bulk or merchant supply and cylinder ("packaged gas") supply. In the U.S. market, on-site supply accounts for approximately 25% of sales, bulk or merchant supply accounts for approximately 35% of sales, and packaged gas supply accounts for the remaining 40% or $3.8billion in sales. Airgas' market focus has been on the packaged gas segment of the market and on small bulk customers. Generally, packaged gas distributors also distribute welding products. The Company believes the U.S. market for welding products to be approximately $3.9billion annually.
Airgas is the largest distributor of packaged gases and welding products in the United States with approximately a 19% market share. The Company's competitors in this market are approximately 900 3 independent distributors that serve approximately 50% of the market through a fragmented distribution network. Large distributors, including vertically integrated gas producers such as Praxair,Inc. ("Praxair"), Liquid Air Corporation of America ("Air Liquide"), and BOC Gases Group ("BOC Gases"), serve the remaining 31% of the packaged gas market. The Company also sells safety equipment. The United States market for safety equipment is approximately $6billion, of which Airgas' share is approximately 4%.
Customer Base The Company's customer base is broad and includes many major industries. The Company estimates the following industry segments account for the indicated percentages of the Company's total sales:  Manufacturing (50%)principally producers of fabricated metal products (13%), industrial and transportation equipment (9%), chemical products (6%), primary metal products (6%), and food and beverage manufacturing (4%);  Service Sector (13%)principally medical and health services (8%);  Wholesale Trade (9%),  Agriculture and Mining (7%);  Construction (7%);  Retail Consumer Establishments (6%);  Transportation and Utilities (4%); and  All Other (4%).
Suppliers The Company purchases industrial, medical and specialty gases pursuant to requirements contracts from national and regional producers of industrial gases. In connection with the acquisition of the U.S. packaged gas operations of Air Products and Chemical ("Air Products"), the Company entered into a 15-year supply agreement under which Air Products will supply at least 35% of the Company's bulk liquid nitrogen, oxygen and argon requirements. Additionally, the Company will purchase helium from Air Products under the terms of the supply agreement. The Company also manufactures certain gases, including acetylene, nitrous oxide, nitrogen, oxygen and argon. The Company believes, that if a contractual arrangement with any supplier of gases or other raw materials was terminated, it would be able to locate alternative sources of supply without disruption of service. The Company purchases hardgoods from major manufacturers and suppliers. For certain products, the Company has negotiated national purchasing arrangements. The Company believes that if an arrangement with any supplier of hardgoods was terminated, it would be able to arrange comparable alternative supply arrangements.
GAS OPERATIONS The Gas Operations segment produces and distributes certain gas products, principally dry ice, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and specialty gases. The Company also operates two air separation plants that produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon which are sold to on-site customers and to the Distribution segment. A description of the businesses included in the Gas Operations segment are as follows: Dry Ice The Company is a producer and distributor of dry ice in the United States. Customers include food processors, food service, pharmaceutical and biotech industries, wholesale trade and grocery and other retail outlets. The dry ice business generally experiences a higher level of sales during the warmer 4 months. The Company's carbon dioxide requirements (dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide) are purchased from the vertically integrated producers of carbon dioxide and from internal production sources.
Carbon Dioxide The Company is a producer and distributor of liquid carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide requirements are met by eight Company-owned production facilities, a 50%-owned joint venture and purchases from vertically integrated gas producers of carbon dioxide. The joint venture also produces and sells liquid carbon dioxide to other producers of industrial gases. The Company believes the United States bulk supply market for liquid carbon dioxide is approximately $475million annually. The largest customer segments include chemical producers and manufacturers of foods and beverages. The Company primarily competes with three major carbon dioxide companies, Praxair, BOC Gases and Air Liquide, which produce over 70% of the merchant carbon dioxide volumes in the United States.
Specialty and Other Gases The Company operates 8 National labs, full scale testing and blending facilities, which blend various special application gas mixes, ultra high purity grade gases, pure hydrocarbon mixtures, EPA protocol gases, and vehicle emission standard gases. Gas mixtures are used in process control, final product qualification and emissions monitoring. Specialty gases produced are primarily sold to the Distribution segment (see Note23 of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure related to segment sales). The third-party customer base for these products consists primarily of environmental-related businesses, manufacturers of electronics, governmental entities, petroleum refiners, pharmaceutical companies and automotive businesses. Gas Operations also provides technical support to 54 regional labs, limited scale testing and blending facilities, which are operated by the Distribution segment. The national and regional labs perform testing and certification services for gas purity.
Nitrous Oxide The Company is a manufacturer of nitrous oxide gas. Nitrous oxide is used as an anesthetic in the medical and dental fields, as a propellant in the packaged food business and is utilized in the manufacturing process of certain high technology electronics industries. The Company's market focus includes bulk customers as well as sales to the Distribution segment. The Company purchases the raw materials utilized in its nitrous oxide production pursuant to contracts with major manufacturers and suppliers.
Suppliers The Company believes that if a contractual arrangement with any Gas Operations segment supplier was terminated, it would not have a material adverse effect on operations. However, two of the Company's 15 dry ice production facilities are located on property owned by BOC Gases. If the current arrangements with BOC Gases were terminated, the Company's dry ice production capabilities may be reduced.
AIRGAS GROWTH STRATEGIES The Company's strategic objectives are to establish itself as the low-cost supplier in the industry and drive market-leading sales growth by leveraging its national distribution infrastructure. To meet these objectives, the Company has established the following strategic initiatives:  increasing market penetration by growing the strategic account business (sales to large customers with multiple locations), increasing account penetration by selling more products to existing customers, strengthening sales leadership training and leveraging the market presence of acquisitions; migrating customers to the appropriate distribution channel by leveraging the Company's safety telesales capabilities, expanding its second-generation eBusiness capability and providing sales training on channel management; 5  improving supply chain efficiencies through optimizing the routing and scheduling of trucks, more efficient cylinder filling and management, controlling procurement and enhancing the operations of the Company's five regional distribution centers;  implementing redesigned business processes that standardize and centralize certain support functions of the Company's matrix organization structure; and  Acquiring core packaged gas distribution.
These strategic objectives are designed to facilitate organic sales and earnings growth. The Company will also continue to supplement its internal growth strategies through core business acquisitions.
REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company's subsidiaries are subject to federal and state laws and regulations adopted for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of employees and users of the Company's products. The Company has programs for the operation and design of its facilities to achieve compliance with applicable environmental regulations. The Company believes that it is in compliance, in all material respects, with such laws and regulations. Expenditures for environmental purposes during fiscal 2002 were not material.
INSURANCE The Company has established insurance programs to cover workers' compensation, business automobile, general and products liability. These programs have self-insured retention of $500,000 per occurrence and an aggregate limit of $1.5million of claims in excess of $500,000. The Company accrues estimated losses using actuarial models and assumptions based on the Company's historical loss experience.
EMPLOYEES On March31, 2002, the Company employed approximately 8,500 employees of whom approximately 5% were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes it has good relations with its employees and has not experienced a significant strike or work stoppage in over ten years.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES The Company holds trademark registrations for "Airgas," "Red-D-Arc," "RED-D-ARC WELDERENTAL," "Gold Gas," "Stainless Mix," "Steelmix," "Alummix," "Powersource," and "VAWELD." The Company has trademarks pending for "RADNOR," "RADNOR Industrial Products," "RADNOR Safety Products," and "RADNOR Welding Products," its private-label product brands. The Company believes that its businesses as a whole are not materially dependent upon any single patent, trademark or license.

8 ITEM3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
In July1996, Praxair,Inc. ("Praxair") filed suit against the Company in the Circuit Court of Mobile County, Alabama, alleging tortious interference with business or contractual relations with respect to Praxair's right of first refusal agreement with the majority shareholders of National Welders Supply Company,Inc. ("National Welders") in connection with the Company's formation of a joint venture with National Welders. In June1998, Praxair filed a motion to dismiss its own action in Alabama and commenced another action in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, alleging substantially the same tortious interference by the Company. The North Carolina action also alleged breach of contract against National Welders and certain shareholders of National Welders and unfair trade practices and conspiracy against all the defendants. In April2002, the Company and Praxair entered into an agreement to settle the litigation in order to avoid the time and expense of a lengthy trial. Each party denied any wrongdoing or liability and Praxair agreed to an early termination of the right of first refusal. As a result of the settlement, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a charge to earnings, net of previously established reserves related to the litigation, of $8.5million. In fiscal 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $6.9million for costs associated with defending the Praxair lawsuit.
In fiscal 1997, the Company announced it was the victim of a fraudulent breach of contract by a third-party supplier of refrigerant gases and recorded a special charge related to product losses and costs associated with the Company's efforts to investigate the fraud and pursue recoveries. In March2001, the Company reached a final settlement with its insurance carriers resulting in insurance recoveries of $4million. The insurance settlement, net of associated legal expenses, was reflected in special charge recoveries in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings included in Item8.
In fiscal 2000, the Company recorded a $7.5million charge representing an estimate of the overall costs associated with the defense and settlement of certain class action lawsuits pertaining to hazardous material charges paid to the Company by customers. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, a settlement agreement and approving court orders covering all such class actions against the Company became final, and the Company reversed $1.1million of the previously accrued defense and settlement costs.
The Company is involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of its business and have not been fully adjudicated. These actions, when ultimately concluded and determined, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect upon the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
ITEM4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March31, 2002.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 OVERVIEW The Company's net sales for the fiscal year ended March31, 2002 were $1.64billion compared to $1.63billion in the prior year. Fiscal 2002 was marked by continued slowing of the U.S. economy, particularly in relation to industrial and manufacturing markets. Despite the weak economic environment, the Company was successful in maintaining sales through its focus on strategic sales initiatives, including account penetration through the sale of safety products and sales to strategic account customers. The Company also continued to implement selective price increases and a discount and contract management program during fiscal 2002 that helped offset rising costs related to purchased gases, personnel costs, insurance and process improvement initiatives. Excluding the effect of the items outlined below, net earnings were $.78 per diluted share in fiscal 2002 compared to $.72 per diluted share in fiscal 2001, adjusted for comparative purposes to exclude the amortization of goodwill. Results as reported in fiscal 2002 were a net loss of $10.4million, or a loss of $.15 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $28.2million, or $.42 per diluted share, in fiscal 2001.
As discussed in the "Income Statement Commentary" below, fiscal 2002 results were affected by the following:  a non-cash after-tax charge of $59million representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle,  a litigation settlement charge of $8.5million ($5.7million after-tax), and  a net non-recurring gain of $1.9million ($120thousand after-tax) resulting from divestitures and a write down of a business held for sale to its net realizable value.
Fiscal 2001 results were affected by the following:  net special charges of $3.6million ($2.3million after-tax),  litigation charges, net, of $5.3million ($3.4million after-tax), and  asset impairments associated with two equity affiliates of $700thousand after-tax.
Fiscal 2002 was a significant year for the Company. In February2002, the Company completed the largest acquisition in its 20-year history with the acquisition of the majority of Air Products and Chemicals,Inc.'s ("Air Products") U.S. packaged gas business for cash of $241million, including transaction costs, (the "Air Products acquisition"). The acquisition included 88 locations in 30 states associated with the filling and distribution of cylinders, liquid dewars, tube trailers, and other containers of industrial gases and non-electronic specialty gases, and the selling of welding hardgoods. The acquired business generates annual sales of approximately $223million and employs nearly 1,100 people. The Company expects that the Air Products acquisition will be accretive to earnings and return on capital in fiscal 2003. In September2001, the Company also acquired six distributor locations from Air Liquide America Corporation ("Air Liquide") for $11million. In a separate transaction in October2001, the Company sold two of its nitrous oxide facilities to Air Liquide for cash proceeds of $10million.
The Company entered into an agreement with Praxair,Inc. ("Praxair") settling the litigation brought by Praxair against the Company in July1996. The litigation alleged tortious interference with Praxair's right of first refusal agreement with National Welders Supply Company,Inc. The parties 13 entered into the settlement agreement in order to avoid the time and expense of a lengthy trial, which was scheduled to begin in July2002. The settlement resulted in the Company recognizing a charge of $8.5million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002.
In July2001, the Company refinanced its revolving credit facilities to extend the term to 2006. Concurrent with the financing, the Company issued $225million of 9.125% senior subordinated notes. In conjunction with the Air Products acquisition, the Company also obtained a $100million term loan from a syndicate of lenders. These transactions enabled the Company to finance the Air Products acquisition entirely with senior bank debt. In fiscal 2002, exclusive of acquisition and divestiture activity and the Company's trade receivables securitization, the Company reduced total debt by $118million. The ability to reduce debt is indicative of the strong cash flow characteristics of the Company's business.
On April1, 2001, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . SFAS142 requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. With the adoption of SFAS142, the Company used new criteria to assess whether goodwill associated with its business units was impaired. The valuation indicated that goodwill associated with the Company's tool business was impaired, which resulted in the recognition of a $59million non-cash charge as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The impaired goodwill was not deductible for taxes, and accordingly, no tax benefit was recorded in relation to the charge.
As prescribed by SFAS142, fiscal 2002 results exclude the amortization of goodwill. For comparability to prior periods, certain discussions in the Management's Discussion and Analysis present fiscal 2001 results adjusted to exclude the amortization of goodwill. The actual results as reported in fiscal 2001 are presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item8. Additionally, Note7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides a reconciliation between the fiscal 2001 reported results and the adjusted results discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis.
INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 0.4% in fiscal 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting same-store sales growth of 0.2%. The Company calculates same-store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures.
2002 2001 Increase (In thousands) Distribution $ 1,494,267 $ 1,487,422 $ 6,845 0.5 % Gas Operations 141,780 141,479 301 0.2 % $ 1,636,047 $ 1,628,901 $ 7,146 0.4 % The Distribution segment's principal products and services include industrial, medical and specialty gases, equipment rental and hardgoods. Industrial gases consist of packaged and small bulk gases. Equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk tanks and welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding supplies and equipment, safety products, and industrial tools and supplies. Sales of the Distribution segment increased $6.8million driven by acquisitions partially offset by a decline in same-store sales. Fiscal 2002 acquisitions contributed sales of $22.6million. Distribution same-store sales decreased $15.8million (-0.6%) resulting from a decline in hardgoods same-store sales of $59.9million (-6.7%), partially offset by gas and rent sales growth of $44.1million (7.1%). The decline in hardgoods same-store sales resulted from lower sales volumes of 14 industrial tools and welding products reflecting the weak industrial and manufacturing environment, particularly with regard to metal fabrication and machinery industries. The decrease in hardgoods sales was correlated with the decline in non-tech industrial production during fiscal 2002. Partially offsetting the decline in tools and welding hardgoods, sales of safety products grew 4% to $258million compared to the prior year reflecting continued success of account penetration initiatives and growth through the Company's telemarketing sales channel. Gas and rent same-store sales growth was driven by price increases during the year in response to rising costs and by growth derived from strategic sales initiatives. Growth in strategic gas sales was driven by higher volumes of medical, specialty and bulk gases. Rental revenue was also favorably impacted by a 12% increase in welder equipment rentals from the Company's expansion of its rental welder fleet. Sales to strategic account customers (sales to large customers with multiple locations) grew 10% to $165million in fiscal 2002 reflecting the Company's success in leveraging its broad distribution network to service large customers. The Company has followed a strategy of focusing on strategic sales initiatives to drive sales growth and market penetration in the industries that it serves.
The Gas Operations segment's sales primarily include dry ice and carbon dioxide that are used for cooling and the production of food, beverages and chemical products. In addition, the segment includes businesses that produce and distribute specialty gases and nitrous oxide. Gas Operations' sales were flat as same-store sales growth was offset by divestiture activity. Same-store sales increased $7.4million (5.9%) driven by price increases to help offset rising costs and higher volumes of liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice. Divestiture activity consisted of the sale of two nitrous oxide plants in fiscal 2002 and the divestiture of the Jackson Dome carbon dioxide reserves and associated pipeline (the "Jackson Dome pipeline") in January2001.
Gross Profits Gross profits, excluding depreciation expense, increased 4.6% in fiscal 2002 compared to 2001. The gross profit margin increased 200 basis points to 50% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 48% in the prior year.
2002 2001 Increase (In thousands) Distribution $ 724,173 $ 689,999 $ 34,174 5.0 % Gas Operations 93,121 91,702 1,419 1.5 % $ 817,294 $ 781,701 $ 35,593 4.6 % Distribution gross profits increased $34.2million from both same-store gross profit growth and acquisition activity. The Distribution segment's gross profit margin of 48.5% in fiscal 2002 increased 210 basis points from 46.4% in the prior year. The improved margin was primarily due to a shift in sales mix towards higher margin gas and rent sales as well as price increases and a discount management program. The shift in sales mix was driven principally by strategic sales initiatives and declining hardgoods sales. Gas and rent comprised 47.3% of Distribution sales compared to 43.5% in the prior year.
Gas Operations' gross profits increased $1.4million primarily from same-store gross profit growth of $5.5million partially offset by divestiture activity. Same-store gross profit growth reflected higher volumes and pricing for liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice. Gas Operations' gross profit margin of 65.7% increased 90 basis points from 64.8% in the prior year, reflecting volume gains leveraging fixed manufacturing costs and price increases.
15 Operating Expenses Selling, distribution and administrative expenses ("SD&A") consist of personnel and related costs, distribution and warehouse costs, occupancy expenses and other selling, general and administrative expenses. SD&A expenses increased $36million (6.2%) compared to the prior fiscal year primarily from net acquisition and divestiture activity and higher costs associated with personnel, health and workers' compensation insurance, costs associated with the Company's Project One initiative and litigation. The Project One initiative began in the second half of fiscal 2001 and is focused on improving certain operational and administrative processes. On a same-store basis, SD&A expenses increased by approximately $27million (5%) in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Higher litigation costs resulted from a litigation settlement, discussed below. As a percentage of net sales, SD&A expenses increased 210 basis points to 37.9% from 35.8% in fiscal 2001.
Litigation costs were $11million in fiscal 2002 compared to $7.5million in fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2002 included a charge of $8.5million, net of previously established reserves, to settle litigation brought by Praxair, a competitor, against the Company in July1996. Fiscal 2001 included a charge of $6.9million for costs to defend against the lawsuit brought by Praxair.
Amortization expense was $8.2million in fiscal 2002 compared to $23.8million in fiscal 2001. On April1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . Under the new pronouncement, goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually. Fiscal 2002 amortization expense relates to non-competition agreements, which are amortized over the terms of the respective agreements. Depreciation expense of $64.8million in fiscal 2002 increased 3% compared to fiscal 2001.
Operating Income Operating income increased 2.2% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 2001, adjusted to exclude the amortization of goodwill. Fiscal 2001 operating income reflects special charges, net, of $3.6million consisting of a charge associated with a cost reduction plan partially offset by a special charge recovery from an insurance settlement. Excluding special charges in fiscal 2001, operating income decreased approximately 1% in fiscal 2002.
2002 2001(a) Increase (Decrease) As Reported 2001 (In thousands) Distribution $ 103,430 $ 104,506 $ (1,076 ) (1.0 )% $ 92,186 Gas Operations 21,603 21,523 80 0.4 % 19,406 Special Charges  (3,643 ) 3,643  (3,643 ) $ 125,033 $ 122,386 $ 2,647 2.2 % $ 107,949 (a) Fiscal 2001 operating income has been adjusted for comparative purposes to exclude the amortization of goodwill in connection with the fiscal 2002 adoption of SFAS142.
The Distribution segment's operating income margin of 6.9% in fiscal 2002 decreased slightly from 7.0% in fiscal 2001, as adjusted. The relatively stable operating income margin year over year reflected the Company's success in raising prices to offset higher operating expenses.
The Gas Operations segment's operating income margin was flat at 15.2% in both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, as adjusted. Higher gross profits from volume and price increases in fiscal 2002 offset the divestiture of the Jackson Dome pipeline and the two nitrous oxide plants, both of which had higher than average operating margins reflected in the prior year's results.
16 Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $51.9million representing a decrease of $9.7million (-15.7%) compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease resulted primarily from lower average debt levels. The decrease in average debt levels was attributable to cash flow provided from operations and proceeds from the divestiture of the Jackson Dome pipeline in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Although the Air Products acquisition increased debt levels at the end of fiscal 2002, average debt levels during fiscal 2002 were approximately $130million lower than fiscal 2001. Weighted-average financing costs were slightly lower in the current year compared to the prior year as higher rates of fixed cost debt associated with the Company's July2001 debt refinancing were offset by lower prevailing market rates related to variable rate debt.
The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $175million of qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $134million and $73million at March31, 2002 and March31, 2001, respectively. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates.
As discussed in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and in Item7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk of certain borrowings through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements, the Company's ratio of fixed to variable interest rates at March31, 2002 was 48% fixed to 52% variable. A majority of the Company's variable rate debt is based on a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). Based on the Company's outstanding variable rate debt and credit rating at March31, 2002, for every increase in LIBOR of 25 basis points, it is estimated that the Company's annual interest expense would increase approximately $1million.
Other Income, net Other income, net, totaled $1.4million in fiscal 2002 compared to $242thousand in fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2002 includes a net non-recurring gain of $1.9million consisting of a $7.4million gain on the divestiture of two nitrous oxide plants partially offset by a $3.6million charge to write down a business unit held for sale to its net realizable value and a $1.9million loss resulting from an indemnity claim related to a prior period divestiture.
Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $3.8million was relatively flat compared to $4.0million in fiscal 2001, adjusted for comparative purposes to exclude goodwill amortization. Fiscal 2001 includes after-tax charges of $700thousand related to asset impairments associated with two equity affiliates. Including goodwill amortization, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates as reported in fiscal 2001 was $2.3million.
Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 38.0% of pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2002 compared to 35.5% in fiscal 2001, adjusted for comparative purposes for the impact of SFAS142. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the $3.6million write-down of a business unit to its net realizable value, which was not deductible for income taxes. The effective income tax rate as reported in fiscal 2001 was 42.3%.
17 Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle In connection with the adoption of SFAS142, the Company performed an evaluation of goodwill as of April1, 2001. The results of the evaluation indicated that goodwill related to one reporting unit, the Company's tool business, was impaired. The Company measured the amount of impairment based on a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. Accordingly, the Company recognized a $59million non-cash, after-tax charge, recorded as of April1, 2001, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write-down of goodwill of the tool business reporting unit to its fair value. The impaired goodwill was not deductible for taxes, and as a result, no tax benefit was recorded in relation to the charge.
On April1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No.137 and 138 . SFAS133 requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS133, the Company recorded the cumulative effect of this accounting change as a liability and a deferred loss of $6.7million in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders' equity to recognize, at fair value, interest rate swap agreements that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Additionally, the Company recorded an asset and adjusted the carrying value of the hedged portion of its fixed rate debt by $6million to recognize, at fair value, interest rate swap agreements that are designated as fair value hedging instruments Net Earnings (Loss) The Company recognized a net loss in fiscal 2002 of $10.4million, or a loss of $.15 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $28.2million, or $.42 per diluted share, in fiscal 2001.
Air Products Acquisition Integration The Air Products acquisition contemplated certain integration activities to optimize the combined operations. Those activities consist of facility exit costs and employee severance related to closing duplicate or overlapping facilities and integration costs related to computer conversions, training and the cost of moving inventory and equipment. Although final cost estimates for those activities are being prepared, the costs to exit existing Airgas facilities and sever employees are expected to be between $2.5 and $3.5million and will be recognized in a special charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Integration costs are expected to be between $3.5 and $4.5million and will be recognized in operating expenses as incurred throughout fiscal 2003.
18 AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 OVERVIEW The Company's net sales for the fiscal year ended March31, 2001 were $1.63billion compared to $1.54billion in the prior year. Despite a slowing U.S. economy, the Company experienced positive same-store sales growth of 3.1%, continuing the same-store sales growth that began in the fiscal 2000 fourth quarter. The Company's successful strategy of leveraging its distribution network to sign new strategic accounts, pursue cross-selling opportunities and promote strategic products had a favorable impact on net sales. In addition, net sales were positively affected by the prior year acquisition of MallinckrodtInc.'s Puritan-Bennett medical gas subsidiary ("Puritan Medical Products"). The Company also implemented price increases during fiscal 2001 that helped to offset rising costs related to purchased gases, salaries and wages, insurance, and distribution. Excluding the effect of the items outlined below, net earnings were $.52 per diluted share in both fiscal 2001 and 2000. Net earnings, as reported, for fiscal 2001 were $28.2million, or $.42 per diluted share, compared to $38.3million, or $.54 per diluted share, in fiscal 2000.
As discussed in the "Income Statement Commentary" below, fiscal 2001 net earnings were affected by the following:  net special charges of $3.6million ($2.3million after-tax),  litigation charges, net, of $5.3million ($3.4million after-tax), and  asset impairments associated with two equity affiliates of $700thousand after-tax.
Fiscal 2000 net earnings were affected by the following:  special charge recoveries of $2.8million ($1.7million after-tax),  divestiture gains of $17.5million ($8.6million after-tax),  a litigation charge of $7.5million ($4.8million after-tax),  an inventory write-down of $3.8million ($2.2million after-tax), and  an after-tax charge of $590thousand representing a change in accounting principle.
Additionally in fiscal 2001, the Company reduced total debt by $183.9million. The ability to reduce debt is indicative of the strong cash flow characteristics of the Company's business. Debt reduction resulted from cash flow from operations, divestitures and a securitization of trade receivables. Operations provided approximately $61million, divestitures provided approximately $50million, principally the divestiture of the Jackson Dome carbon dioxide reserves and associated pipeline ("Jackson Dome pipeline"), and the trade receivables securitization program provided approximately $73million.
19 INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY Net Sales Net sales increased 5.6% in fiscal 2001 compared to 2000, driven by same-store sales growth of 3.1% and prior year acquisitions included for a full year in 2001.
2001 2000 Increase (In thousands) Distribution $ 1,487,422 $ 1,409,949 $ 77,473 5.5 % Gas Operations 141,479 132,385 9,094 6.9 % $ 1,628,901 $ 1,542,334 $ 86,567 5.6 % Distribution sales increased $77.5million as a result of net acquisition and divestiture activity and same-store sales growth. Fiscal 2001 sales increased $43.8million from seven distributor acquisitions since April1, 1999, partially offset by a divestiture during fiscal 2000. The most significant of the acquisitions was that of Puritan Medical Products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. Distribution same-store sales growth of $33.7million (2.7%) resulted from gas and rent sales growth of $28.8million (5.1%) and hardgoods sales growth of $4.9million (1.0%). Gas and rent same-store sales growth was primarily attributable to higher volumes of strategic products and continued success of certain sales initiatives, such as strategic accounts. Growth in strategic product sales resulted from expansion of the rental welder fleet and improvements in certain gas product sales including medical and specialty gases. Price increases implemented during fiscal 2001 also contributed to gas and rent sales growth. Hardgoods same-store sales growth was driven principally by an increase in safety sales resulting from the successful cross-selling of safety products through the Company's distribution network. Although hardgoods same-store sales growth was positive in fiscal 2001, hardgoods sales slowed in the fiscal third quarter with further contraction in the fourth quarter resulting from the slowing U.S. industrial economy.
The Gas Operations' sales increased $9.1million in fiscal 2001 compared to the prior year primarily from same-store sales growth (7.2%). Gas Operations' same-store sales growth resulted from higher volumes of liquid carbon dioxide, dry ice and nitrous oxide. Sales growth was also driven by price increases that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 to help offset the impact of higher energy and distribution costs. The reduction in sales from the divestiture of the Jackson Dome pipeline in fiscal 2001 and the divestiture of operations in Poland and Thailand in fiscal 2000 were offset by nitrous oxide production businesses that were acquired with Puritan Medical Products.
Gross Profits Gross profits, excluding depreciation expense, increased 7.7% in fiscal 2001 compared to 2000.
2001 2000 Increase (In thousands) Distribution $ 689,999 $ 649,827 $ 40,172 6.2 % Gas Operations 91,702 75,910 15,792 20.8 % $ 781,701 $ 725,737 $ 55,964 7.7 % Distribution gross profits increased $40.2million resulting from net acquisition and divestiture activity and same-store gross profits growth. Acquisition and divestiture activity accounted for a net increase in gross profits of $29.0million, primarily from the acquisition of Puritan Medical Products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. Same-store gross profits increased $11.2million (2.4%) compared to the prior year. Same-store gross profit growth consisted of a $14.4million (3.7%) increase in gas and rent, partially offset by a decrease in hardgoods gross profits of $3.2million. Same-store gross profits of 20 gas and rent increased resulting from higher sales volumes and price increases implemented during fiscal 2001. An expanded rental welder fleet also contributed to the increase in gross profits. The Distribution segment's gross profit margin of 46.4% in fiscal 2001 increased 30 basis points from 46.1% in the prior year primarily as a result of a shift in sales mix to higher margin gases. The shift in sales mix was driven principally by higher margin medical gases contributed by Puritan Medical Products. The decline in hardgoods same-store gross profits resulted from general weakness in certain manufacturing and industrial hardgoods markets served by the Company. The decline in hardgoods gross profits was partially mitigated by lower costs from centralized purchasing initiatives and continued growth of higher margin private label products. Private label products reached an annual run rate of $45million in fiscal 2001 representing a 40% increase over the prior year.
The Gas Operations segment's gross profits increased $15.8million primarily from same-store gross profit growth and net acquisition activity. Same-store gross profit growth of $10.5million (13.4%) resulted primarily from higher sales volumes and price increases of dry ice, liquid carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Gross profits increased $1.5million from net acquisition activity, primarily consisting of the prior year acquisition of Puritan Medical Products's nitrous oxide production businesses. In addition, the prior year was adversely affected by an inventory write-down of $3.8million related to certain specialty gas inventories. Gas Operations' gross profit margin was 64.8% compared to 57.3% in the prior year. The gross profit margin in the prior year reflects the impact of the specialty gas inventory write-down.
Operating Expenses Selling, distribution and administrative expenses ("SD&A") increased $50.8million (9.5%) compared to the prior fiscal year primarily from net acquisition and divestiture activity and higher costs associated with personnel, distribution and insurance. On a same-store basis, SD&A expenses are estimated to have increased approximately $32million in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. Personnel costs were affected by rising salaries and wages driven by a competitive labor market. Higher distribution costs resulted primarily from increases in the price of fuel and energy. Insurance costs were driven by rising medical costs related to workers' compensation and health insurance. The Company implemented a cost reduction plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The cost reduction plan focused on a reduction in workforce, the closure of 30 branch locations and the planned disposition of certain non-core businesses. As a percentage of net sales, SD&A expenses increased to 35.8% from 34.5% in fiscal 2000.
Fiscal 2001 SD&A expenses included legal expenses of $7.5million. Fiscal 2001 legal expenses reflect litigation charges of $5.3million, net. The net litigation charges consist primarily of a fourth quarter charge of $6.9million related to a lawsuit brought by a competitor, Praxair,Inc. The charge reflected an estimate of the costs associated with the defense of the lawsuit. The charge was partially offset by the final settlement and reversal of $1.1million of liabilities established in fiscal 2000 associated with the defense and settlement of class-action lawsuits related to hazardous materials charges. Legal expenses for fiscal 2000 of $9.6million included a $7.5million litigation charge representing the Company's original estimate of the costs to defend against and settle the class-action lawsuits.
Depreciation expense of approximately $63million remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2000. Amortization expense of $23.8million decreased $1.9million (-7.2%) compared to fiscal 2000 primarily from the expiration of non-compete agreements related to prior acquisitions.
Special Charges (Recoveries) Special charges in fiscal 2001 included a charge of $8.5million related to a cost reduction plan implemented by the Company to improve operating results at certain business units as well as to 21 mitigate rising operating expenses. The fourth quarter 2001 cost reduction charge included severance costs for a reduction in workforce, exit costs for the closure of 30 branch locations and losses associated with the anticipated divestiture of certain non-core businesses. The non-core businesses to be divested generated annual sales of approximately $10million in fiscal 2001 and were included in the Company's Distribution segment. The charge was partially offset by $4.9million of special charge recoveries primarily consisting of a favorable insurance settlement associated with the fiscal 1997 special charge. Special charge recoveries in fiscal 2000 consist of $2.8million primarily from a favorable insurance settlement related to the fiscal 1997 special charge.
Operating Income Operating income increased 1.1% in fiscal 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding special (charges) recoveries, operating income increased 7.4%.
2001 2000 Increase (Decrease) (In thousands) Distribution $ 92,186 $ 94,671 $ (2,485 ) (2.6 )% Gas Operations 19,406 9,231 10,175 110 % Special (Charges) Recoveries (3,643 ) 2,829 (6,472 )  $ 107,949 $ 106,731 $ 1,218 1.1 % The Distribution segment's operating income margin of 6.2% in fiscal 2001 decreased from 6.7% in fiscal 2000 primarily due to higher operating expenses, partially offset by gross profits from same-store sales growth and acquisitions.
The Gas Operations segment's operating income margin of 13.7% in fiscal 2001 increased from 7.0% in fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2001 results benefited from higher gross profits from same-store sales growth and price increases. The prior year was adversely affected by a $3.8million inventory write-down of certain specialty gas inventories. Gas Operations' operating income margin was 9.8% in fiscal 2000, excluding the impact of the inventory write-down.
Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $61.5million and represents an increase of $4million (6.9%) compared to fiscal 2000. The increase resulted from higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower weighted-average interest rates. The increase in the average debt level in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 acquisition of Puritan Medical Products as well as common stock repurchases during fiscal 2001.
In December2000, the Company entered into a trade receivables securitization agreement with two commercial banks. Net proceeds received by the Company through March31, 2001 were $73.2million and were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities. The discount on the securitization of trade receivables of $1.3million in fiscal 2001 represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates.
Other Income, net Other income, net, totaled $242thousand in fiscal 2001 compared to $17.9million in fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2000 includes a $14.9million gain from the divestitures of operations in Poland and Thailand.
22 Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $2.3million decreased $1.1million compared to fiscal 2000. The decrease in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to after-tax charges of $700thousand related to asset impairments associated with two equity affiliates.
Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 42.3% of pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2001 compared to 44.8% in 2000. Excluding the tax effect related to certain gains and special charges in both periods, the effective income tax rate was 41.1% of pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2001 compared to 41.5% in 2000.
Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle Fiscal 2000 includes a charge to net earnings of $590thousand related to the adoption of Statement of Position 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities." The charge primarily resulted from the write-off of start-up costs capitalized in prior fiscal years in connection with the Company's two air separation units.
Net Earnings Net earnings in fiscal 2001 were $28.2million, or $.42 per diluted share, compared to $38.3million, or $.54 per diluted share, in fiscal 2000.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Fiscal 2002 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $249.4million in fiscal 2002 compared to $199.0million in fiscal 2001. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items including the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, were $159.2million compared to $125.1million in fiscal 2001. The sale of trade receivables under the trade receivables securitization program provided cash of $60.8million in fiscal 2002 compared to $73.2million in the prior year. Working capital and other assets and liabilities, net, provided cash of $29.4million compared to $696thousand in fiscal 2001, representing a net improvement in cash flow of $28.7million. Working capital improvement was primarily driven by lower levels of inventory and trade receivables as well as higher outstanding accounts payable. Lower inventory levels resulted from a decline in hardgoods sales, more effective utilization of the Company's centralized distribution centers and initiatives designed to consolidate product lines and vendors. Higher outstanding accounts payable reflected an increase in days payable outstanding to 44days from 39days at March31, 2001. Cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities and fund capital expenditures.
Cash used in investing activities totaled $294.7million and primarily consisted of acquisitions and capital expenditures. Acquisitions in fiscal 2002 used cash of $252.5million and consisted of the fourth quarter acquisition of a majority of Air Products' U.S. packaged gas business and the third quarter acquisition of six gas distributor locations from Air Liquide. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2002 of $58.3million were 12% lower than the prior year resulting from lower cylinder purchases reflecting effective asset management initiatives. The Company anticipates fiscal 2003 capital spending will fall within a range of $75 to $80million. Proceeds of $10.2million were also received from the divestiture of two nitrous oxide plants during fiscal 2002.
Financing activities provided cash of $45.3million primarily from borrowings in relation to the Air Products acquisition. Financing activities also included the payment of $12.5million in financing costs related to the refinancing of the Company's revolving credit facilities, issuance of senior subordinated 23 notes and a term loan obtained in relation to the Air Products acquisition. The reduction in the cash overdraft used cash of $17million. The cash overdraft represents the balance of outstanding checks. Exclusive of acquisition and divestiture activity and the Company's trade receivables securitization, the Company reduced total debt by $118million in fiscal 2002. The ability to reduce debt is indicative of the strong cash flow characteristics of the Company's business.
Cash on hand at the end of each fiscal year is zero. On a daily basis, depository accounts are swept of all available funds. The funds are deposited into a concentration account through which all cash on hand is used to repay debt under the Company's revolving credit facilities.
The Company will continue to look for appropriate acquisitions of distributors to complement its broad distribution network. Capital expenditures, current debt maturities and any future acquisitions are expected to be funded through the use of cash flow from operations, revolving credit facilities, and other financing alternatives. The Company believes that its sources of financing are adequate for its anticipated needs and that it could arrange additional sources of financing for unanticipated requirements. The cost and terms of any future financing arrangement depend on the market conditions and the Company's financial position at that time.
The Company does not currently pay dividends.
Financial Instruments Revolving Credit Facilities On July30, 2001, the Company refinanced its revolving credit facilities due December5, 2002. The refinanced credit facilities consist of unsecured revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of lenders totaling $367.5million and $50million Canadian (U.S. $32million) under a credit agreement with a maturity date of July30, 2006. At March31, 2002, the Company had borrowings under the credit agreement of approximately $208million and $35million Canadian (U.S. $21million). The Company also had commitments under letters of credit supported by the credit agreement of approximately $38million at March31, 2002. The credit agreement contains covenants that include the maintenance of certain leverage ratios, a fixed charge ratio, and potential restrictions on certain additional borrowing, the payment of dividends and the repurchase of common stock. Based on restrictions related to certain leverage ratios, the Company had additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facilities of approximately $105million at March31, 2002. The variable interest rates of the U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facilities are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Rates, respectively. At March31, 2002, the effective interest rates on borrowings under the revolving credit facilities were 3.98% on U.S. borrowings and 2.15% on Canadian borrowings.
Borrowings under the revolving credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and Canadian borrowings are guaranteed by foreign subsidiaries. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company's credit rating as determined by third-party credit agencies was lowered in response to additional indebtedness related to the Air Products acquisition. The lower credit rating required the Company to pledge 100% of the stock of its domestic guarantor subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of its foreign guarantor subsidiaries for the benefit of the syndicate of lenders. If the Company's credit rating is further reduced, the Company will be required to grant a security interest in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company for the benefit of the syndicate of lenders.
Term Loan In February2002, the Company completed the acquisition of the majority of Air Products' U.S. packaged gas business for cash of $241million. In anticipation of the transaction, the Company 24 amended its revolving credit facilities to permit the acquisition and obtained a $100million term loan. The term loan is due in quarterly installments beginning June30, 2002 with a final payment due July30, 2006. The term loan is unsecured and bears a variable interest rate based on LIBOR plus a spread related to the Company's credit rating. At March31, 2002, the effective interest rate of the term loan was 4.15%. The additional term loan along with the Company's existing revolving credit facilities enabled the Company to finance the Air Products acquisition entirely with senior bank debt.
Senior Subordinated Notes On July30, 2001, concurrent with the refinancing of the revolving credit facilities, the Company issued $225million of senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") with a maturity date of October1, 2011. The Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 9.125%, payable semi-annually on April1 and October1 of each year with the first interest payment due April1, 2002. The Notes were sold in accordance with the provisions of Rule144A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"). In October2001, the Company exchanged the Notes for substantially similar notes registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with the Securities Act. The notes contain covenants that could restrict the payment of dividends, the issuance of preferred stock, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. The notes are guaranteed on a subordinated basis by each of the domestic guarantors under the revolving credit facilities.
Medium-Term Notes The Company had the following medium-term notes outstanding at March31, 2002: $75million of unsecured notes due March2004 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.14% and $100million of unsecured notes due September2006 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.75%. At March31, 2002, the Company's long-term debt also included acquisition notes and other long-term debt instruments of approximately $33million with interest rates ranging from 7.00% to 9.00%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company refinanced $20million of the acquisition notes with borrowings under its revolving credit facilities.
Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. At March31, 2002, the Company was party to a total of 12 interest rate swap agreements. The swap agreements are with major financial institutions and aggregate $323million in notional principal amount at March31, 2002. Seven swap agreements with approximately $168million in notional principal amount require the Company to make fixed interest payments based on an average effective rate of 6.64% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparties based on three-month LIBOR (average rate of 1.93% at March31, 2002). The remaining term of these swap agreements range from between three months and three years. Five swap agreements with approximately $155million in notional principal amount require the Company to make variable interest payments based on six-month LIBOR (average rate of 3.78% at March31, 2002) and receive fixed interest payments from its counterparties based on an average effective rate of 8.05% at March31, 2002. The remaining term of these swap agreements range from between one and nine years. The Company monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties, and does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties. After considering the effect of interest rate swap agreements, the Company's ratio of fixed to variable interest rates was 48% fixed to 52% variable at March31, 2002.
A majority of the Company's variable rate debt is based on a spread over LIBOR. Based on the Company's outstanding variable rate debt and credit rating at March31, 2002, for every increase in LIBOR of 25 basis points, it is estimated that the Company's annual interest expense would increase approximately $1million.
25 Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $175million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement expires in December2003, but the initial term is subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. During fiscal 2002, the Company sold, net of its retained interest, $1.71billion of trade receivables and remitted to bank conduits, pursuant to a servicing agreement, $1.58billion in collections on those receivables. The net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $134million at March31, 2002 and $73million at March31, 2001.
The transaction has been accounted for as a sale under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities . Under the agreement, eligible trade receivables are sold to bank conduits through a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity, which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The difference between the proceeds from the sale and the carrying value of the receivables is recognized as "Discount on securitization of trade receivables" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings and varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. The Company retains a subordinated interest in the receivables sold, which is recorded at the receivables' previous carrying value. In accordance with a servicing agreement, the Company services, administers and collects the trade receivables on behalf of the bank conduits. The servicing fees charged to the bank conduits approximate the costs of collections. The Company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts on trade receivables that it retains.
Operating Lease with Trust The Company leases real estate and certain equipment from a trust established by a commercial bank. The operating leases are structured as a sale-leaseback transaction in which the trust holds title to the properties and equipment included in the leases. The rental payments are based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin and the cost of the property acquired by the trust. At March31, 2002, the non-cancelable lease obligation of the real estate and equipment lease totaled approximately $43million. The leases have a five-year term, which expires in October2004. The Company has guaranteed a residual value of the real estate and the equipment at the end of the lease term of approximately $30million. A gain of approximately $12million on the equipment portion of the transaction has been deferred until the expiration of the Company's guarantee of the residual value.
Employee Benefits Trust The Company maintains a grantor trust (the "Trust") to fund certain future obligations of the Company's employee benefit and compensation plans. The Company, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, sold shares of common stock to the Trust. During fiscal 1999 through 2001, the Trust purchased a total of approximately 7million shares of common stock, previously held as treasury stock, from the Company, for approximately $54million (based on the average market closing price for the five days preceding each transaction). The Company holds promissory notes from the Trust in the amount of each purchase. Shares held by the Trust serve as collateral for the promissory notes and are available to fund certain employee benefit plan obligations as the promissory notes are repaid. The shares held by the Trust are not considered outstanding for earnings per share purposes until they are released from serving as collateral for the promissory notes. Approximately 1.4million and 1.2million shares were issued from the Trust for employee benefit programs during fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. As of March31, 2002, the Trust held approximately 4.3million shares of Company common stock. An independent third-party financial institution serves as the Trustee. The Trustee votes or tenders shares held by the Trust in accordance with instructions received from the participants in the employee benefit and compensation plans funded by the Trust.
26 Inflation While the U.S. inflation rate has been relatively modest for several years, rising costs continue to affect the Company's business. The Company strives to minimize the effects of inflation through cost containment and price increases under highly competitive conditions.
OTHER Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the net carrying value of trade receivables, inventories, goodwill, other intangible assets and business insurance reserves. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Trade Receivables The Company must make estimates of the collectability of its trade receivables. Management has established an allowance for doubtful accounts to adjust the carrying value of trade receivables to fair value based on an estimate of the amount of trade receivables that are uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical experience, economic trends, and known bankruptcies and problem accounts. Management believes that the allowances for doubtful accounts as of March31, 2002 and 2001 are adequate.
Inventories The Company's inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon its physical condition as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company adopted SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as of April1, 2001. SFAS142 requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will not be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of October31 of each year. The annual impairment test used by the Company consists of a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments that could be materially different if different estimates, assumptions and judgments were used.
Business Insurance Reserves The Company has insurance programs to cover workers' compensation, business automobile, general and products liability. The insurance programs have self-insured retention of $500thousand per occurrence and an aggregate limit of $1.5million of claims in excess of $500thousand. The Company accrues estimated losses using actuarial models and assumptions based on the Company's historical loss experience. Although management believes that the insurance reserves are adequate, the reserve 27 estimates are based on historical experience, which may not be indicative of current and future losses. In addition, the actuarial calculations used to estimate insurance reserves are based on numerous assumptions, some of which are subjective. The Company will adjust its insurance reserves, if necessary, in the event that future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns.
New Accounting Pronouncements In July2001, the FASB issued SFAS No.143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations . SFAS143 requires the recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. A retirement obligation is defined as one in which a legal obligation exists in the future resulting from existing laws, statutes or contracts. The Company is required to adopt SFAS143 on April1, 2003. The Company has evaluated SFAS143 and does not believe its adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
In August2001, the FASB issued SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . SFAS144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. This Statement requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. SFAS144 requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of (by sale, abandonment, or in a distribution to owners) or is classified as held for sale. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The Company was required to adopt SFAS144 on April1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS144 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement made herein or that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company.
29 ITEM7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate exposure arises primarily from the interest payment terms of the Company's borrowing agreements. Interest rate swap agreements are used to adjust the interest rate risk exposures that are inherent in its portfolio of funding sources. The Company has not, and will not establish any interest risk positions for purposes other than managing the risk associated with its portfolio of funding sources. The Company maintains the ratio of fixed to variable rate debt within parameters established by management under policies approved by the Board of Directors. After the effect of interest rate swap agreements, the ratio of fixed to variable rate debt was 48% to 52% at March31, 2002. Counterparties to interest rate swap agreements are major financial institutions. The Company has established counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions with long-term credit ratings of 'A' or better. In addition, the Company monitors its position and the credit ratings of its counterparties, thereby minimizing the risk of non-performance by the counterparties.
The table below summarizes the Company's market risks associated with long-term debt obligations, interest rate swaps and LIBOR-based agreements as of March31, 2002. For long-term debt obligations, the table presents cash flows related to payments of principal and interest by fiscal year of maturity. For interest rate swaps and LIBOR-based agreements, the table presents the notional amounts underlying the agreements by year of maturity. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual payments to be exchanged and are not actually paid or received. Fair values were computed using market quotes, if available, or based on discounted cash flows using market interest rates as of the end of the period.

The variable rate of the Canadian dollar portion of the revolving credit facilities is the rate on Canadian Bankers' acceptances as of March31, 2002.
(b) The operating lease terminates October8, 2004, but may be renewed subject to provisions of the lease agreement.
(c) The three-year agreement expires on December19, 2003, but the initial term is subject to renewal provisions of the trade receivables securitization agreement.
31 Limitations of the tabular presentation As the table incorporates only those interest rate risk exposures that exist as of March31, 2002, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. In addition, actual cash flows of financial instruments in future periods may differ materially from prospective cash flows presented in the table due to future fluctuations in variable interest rates, debt levels and the Company's credit rating.
Foreign Currency Rate Risk Canadian subsidiaries of the Company are funded in part with local currency debt. The Company does not otherwise hedge its exposure to translation gains and losses relating to foreign currency net asset exposures. The Company considers its exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations to be immaterial to its consolidated financial position and results of operations.

F-1 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT The Board of Directors Airgas,Inc.: We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Airgas,Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) listed in the accompanying index. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Airgas,Inc. and subsidiaries as of March31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in note1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets and derivative instruments and hedging activities for the year ended March31, 2002.
/s/KPMGLLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania May6, 2002 F-2 STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the consolidated financial statements and related financial information in this Annual Report on Form10-K. The statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial statements reflect management's informed judgment and estimation as to the effect of events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed.
Management maintains a system of internal control at each business unit. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and records properly reflect transactions executed in accordance with management's authorization. The Company also maintains a staff of internal auditors who review and evaluate the system of internal control on a continual basis. In determining the extent of the system of internal control, management recognizes that the cost should not exceed the benefits derived. The evaluation of these factors requires estimates and judgment by management.
The Company's financial statements have been audited by KPMGLLP, independent auditors. Their Independent Auditors' Report, which is based on an audit made in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, is presented on the previous page. In performing their audit, KPMG LLP considers the Company's internal control structure to the extent they deem necessary in order to plan their audit, determine the nature, timing and extent of tests to be performed and issue their report on the consolidated financial statements.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting solely of non-employee Directors, meets regularly (jointly and separately) with the independent auditors, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself that they are properly discharging their responsibilities. The auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee.

F-7 AIRGAS,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1)SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a)Description of the Business Airgas,Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") is the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases (delivered in "packaged" or cylinder form), and welding, safety and related products. The Company also produces dry ice, liquid carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and specialty gases for distribution throughout the United States. The Company was founded in 1982 and became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986.
(b)Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Airgas,Inc. and subsidiaries. Unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for on the equity method and generally consist of 20-50% owned operations where control does not exist or is considered temporary. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
The Company has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the net carrying value of trade receivables, inventories, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and loss contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
(c)Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for approximately 91% and 88% of the inventories at March31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cost for the remainder of inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
(d)Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment are initially stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The carrying values of long-lived assets, including plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded value cannot be recovered from undiscounted future cash flows. When the book value of an asset exceeds associated expected future cash flows, it is considered to be impaired and is written down to fair value, which is determined based on either future cash flows or appraised values.
(e)Other Intangible Assets and Deferred Financing Costs Costs and payments pursuant to non-competition arrangements entered into in connection with business acquisitions are amortized over the terms of the arrangements, which are principally over five years. The Company assesses the recoverability of non-competition arrangements by determining whether the amortization of the asset balance can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows of the related business over its remaining life.
Costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt.
F-8 (f)Commitments and Contingencies The Company's policy is to accrue future legal fees associated with outstanding litigation. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the claim, assessment or damages can be reasonably estimated.
The Company maintains business insurance programs with significant self-insured retention, which covers workers' compensation, business automobile and general products liability claims. The Company accrues estimated losses using actuarial models and assumptions based on historical loss experience. The actuarial calculations used to estimate business insurance reserves are based on numerous assumptions, some of which are subjective. The Company will adjust its business insurance reserves, if necessary, in the event future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns.
(g)Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
(h)Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Company's foreign operations is the applicable local currency. The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using average exchange rates during each reporting period. The gains or losses, net of applicable deferred income taxes, resulting from such translations are included in stockholders' equity as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss." Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as incurred.
(i)Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. Concentrations of credit risk are limited due to the Company's large number of customers and their dispersion across many industries throughout North America. Credit terms granted to customers are generally net 30days.
(j) Financial Instruments In managing interest rate risk exposure, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements. An interest rate swap is a contractual exchange of interest payments between two parties. A standard interest rate swap involves the payment of a fixed rate times a notional amount by one party in exchange for a floating rate times the same notional amount from another party. As interest rates change, the difference to be paid or received is accrued and recognized as interest expense over the life of the agreement. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes and the Company has the ability and intent to hold these instruments to maturity. Counterparties to the Company's interest rate swap agreements are major financial institutions. With the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.133, Accounting F-9 for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No.137 and 138, in fiscal 2002 (see Note(1) (n)), the Company recognizes interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheet at fair value. The interest rate swap agreements are marked to market with changes in fair value recognized in either other comprehensive income (loss) or in the carrying value of the hedged portions of the medium-term and senior subordinated debt notes.
The carrying amounts for trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
(k) Employee Benefits Trust The Company established a grantor trust (the "Trust") to fund future obligations of the Company's employee benefit and compensation plans. Shares are purchased by the Trust from the Company at fair market value and are reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets under the caption "Employee benefits trust." Shares are transferred from the Trust to fund compensation and employee benefit obligations based on the original cost of the shares to the Trust. The satisfaction of compensation and employee benefit plan obligations is based on the fair value of shares transferred. Differences between the original cost of the shares to the Trust and the fair market value of shares transferred is charged or credited to capital in excess of par value.
(l) Revenue Recognition Revenue from sales of gas and hardgoods products is recognized when products are delivered to customers. Rental fees on cylinders, bulk gas storage tanks and other equipment are recognized when earned. Under long-term lease agreements in which rental fees are collected in advance, revenues are deferred and recognized over the terms of the lease agreements.
(m) Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs The Company recognizes delivery and freight charges to customers as elements of net sales. Costs of third-party freight are recognized as cost of sales while costs of deliveries by company vehicles and personnel are recognized as elements of selling, distribution and administrative expenses and depreciation expense.
(n) Accounting and Disclosure Changes SFAS133 On April1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No.133, which requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS133, on April1, 2001, the Company recorded the cumulative effect of this accounting change as a liability and a deferred loss of $6.7million in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders' equity to recognize, at fair value, interest rate swap agreements that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Additionally, the Company recorded an asset and adjusted the carrying value of the hedged portion of its fixed rate debt by $6million to recognize, at fair value, interest rate swap agreements that are designated as fair value hedging instruments.
SFAS141 Effective July1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No.141, Business Combinations . SFAS141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001. The adoption of SFAS141 did not have an impact on the historical results of operations, financial position or liquidity of the Company.
F-10 SFAS142 In July2001, the FASB issued SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . As allowed under the Standard, the Company adopted SFAS142 retroactively to April1, 2001. SFAS142 requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually.
With the adoption of SFAS142, the Company reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all acquired intangible assets to make any necessary amortization period adjustments. Based on that assessment, no adjustments were made to the amortization period or residual values of other intangible assets. Additionally, certain reclassifications were made to previously issued financial statements to conform to the presentation required by SFAS142 (see Note7).
SFAS142 provides a six-month transitional period from the effective date of adoption for the Company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired. To the extent that an indication of impairment exists, the Company must perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment. The Company determined the implied fair value of each of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and compared such values to the respective reporting units' carrying amounts. This evaluation indicated that goodwill recorded in the Distribution segment associated with its industrial tool reporting unit was impaired as of April1, 2001. Conditions that contributed to the goodwill impairment included the deterioration of the industrial and machine tool markets since the acquisition of the businesses in this reporting unit and difficulty in achieving expected cross-selling synergies. The resulting business performance made it difficult to justify further investment to achieve the growth originally forecast for the business. Accordingly, the Company recognized a $59million non-cash charge, recorded as of April1, 2001, as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write-down of goodwill to its fair value. The impaired goodwill was not deductible for taxes, and as a result, no tax benefit was recorded in relation to the charge.
SFAS142 also requires goodwill to be tested annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of October31 of each year. As of October31, 2001, the Company's annual assessment of each of its reporting units indicated that goodwill was not impaired.
Statement of Position 98-5 The Company adopted Statement of Position 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities , as required, in fiscal 2000 resulting in a charge to net earnings of $590thousand as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The charge primarily resulted from the write-off of start-up costs capitalized in connection with the Company's two air separation units.
(o) Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current presentation.
(2)ACQUISITIONS& DIVESTITURES (a)Acquisitions Acquisitions have been recorded using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, results of their operations have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since the effective dates of the respective acquisitions.
F-11 Fiscal 2002 On February28, 2002, the Company purchased the majority of Air Products and Chemicals,Inc.'s ("Air Products") U.S. packaged gas business, excluding its electronic gases and magnetic resonance imaging-related helium operations, for cash of approximately $241million, including transaction costs paid through March31, 2002. The transaction was financed entirely with senior bank debt. The acquisition included 88 facilities in 30 states associated with the filling and distribution of cylinders, liquid dewars, tube trailers, and other containers of industrial gases and non-electronic specialty gases, and the selling of welding hardgoods, including customer service centers, warehouses, and other related assets. Airgas expects that the transaction will be a strategic fit with the Company's core business and that the acquisition will strengthen its national network by giving it a presence in important geographies. Additionally, the Company expects the acquisition of Air Products' non-electronic specialty gas operations will strengthen the core competencies of Airgas' Specialty Gas Operations, enabling it to enhance its competitiveness. Separately, Air Products sold its packaged gas operations in the Carolinas and southern Virginia to National Welders Supply Company,Inc. ("National Welders"), with which the Company has a joint venture. The operations acquired by National Welders generated approximately $17million in revenue and employ about 100 people.
The estimates of fair values of net assets acquired, identified intangibles and goodwill related to the transaction with Air Products are based on a preliminary estimate. The Company has not yet finalized the determination of the specific fair values of the assets acquired. Additional work related to the performance of asset appraisals needs to be completed to finalize the allocation of the purchase price to net assets, identified intangibles and goodwill acquired. The entire purchase price ultimately assigned to goodwill will be deductible for income taxes. The Company does not expect the final allocation of the purchase price to differ materially from the amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Below is the preliminary purchase price allocation to each major asset and liability caption of the acquired packaged gas business: (In thousands) Current assets $ 27,049 Property, plant and equipment, net 197,674 Goodwill 22,208 Intangible assets 3,786 Current liabilities (8,635 ) Long-term liabilities (812 ) Total $ 241,270 Additionally, in September2001, the Company acquired six retail distributor locations from Air Liquide America Corporation ("Air Liquide"). The purchase price of $11million was paid to Air Liquide on October1, 2001 and resulted in goodwill of approximately $7million. The amount of goodwill associated with the Air Liquide transaction is consistent with similarly sized gas distribution acquisitions and is entirely deductible for income taxes.
Fiscal 2001 During fiscal 2001, the Company purchased one business for approximately $2million.
Fiscal 2000 During fiscal 2000, the Company purchased six businesses. The largest of these acquisitions and their effective dates included Brown Welding Supply,LLC. (July1, 1999), Oxygen Sales& Service,Inc. (August1, 1999) and Puritan-Bennett Corporation (January21, 2000). The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions amounted to approximately $105million. The purchase price for the remaining 3 businesses amounted to approximately $4million.
F-12 In connection with the above acquisitions, the total purchase price, cash paid and liabilities assumed were as follows: Years Ended March31, 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Cash paid $ 252,538 $ 1,006 $ 99,204 Issuance of common stock    Notes issued to sellers   1,399 Notes payable and capital leases assumed 1,466  561 Other liabilities assumed and accrued acquisition costs 8,451 536 7,762 Total purchase price $ 262,455 $ 1,542 $ 108,926 The purchase price for business acquisitions was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Such allocations have been based on preliminary estimates of fair value at the date of acquisition, which may be revised at a later date. Costs in excess of net assets acquired (goodwill) for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 amounted to $29.6million, $600thousand and $33million, respectively.
The following presents unaudited estimated pro forma operating results as if the fiscal 2002 and 2001 acquisitions had been consummated on April1, 2000. The pro forma results were prepared from financial information provided by Air Products and reflect that company's historic cost structure, which included a significant allocation of corporate overhead. Pro forma adjustments to the Air Products results were limited to those related to the Company's stepped-up basis in acquired assets and adjustments to reflect the Company's borrowing and tax rates. The pro forma adjustments reflect the decline in the Company's average borrowing rates under the senior bank debt used to finance the acquisition. Those rates were 4.8% in fiscal 2002 and 8.2% in fiscal 2001. The pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisitions been made as of April1, 2000 or of results that may occur in the future.
Unaudited Years Ended March31, 2002 2001 (In thousands, except per share amounts) Net sales $ 1,845,817 $ 1,863,064 Income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 52,633 26,232 Net earnings (loss) (6,367 ) 26,232 Diluted earnings (loss) per share (.09 ) .39 (b)Divestitures In December2001, the carrying values of the net assets of Kendeco,Inc., an industrial tool business in the Distribution operating segment, were reduced by $3.6million to their net realizable value based on the estimated selling price less cost to sell of $3.5million. The loss, reflected in Other income, net, included the write-off of $3.1million of non-tax deductible goodwill. The Company completed the sale of Kendeco in May2002. Kendeco's operations were reflected in the operating results of the Distribution segment.
In October2001, the Company sold two of its nitrous oxide production facilities to Air Liquide. The Company has retained its remaining four nitrous oxide production facilities to meet its requirements as a major producer and distributor of nitrous oxide. After-tax proceeds from the sale of F-13 approximately $10million were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities. The Company recognized a gain on the transaction of $7.4million in Other income, net in the fiscal 2002 third quarter. The nitrous oxide facilities were reflected in the operating results of the Gas Operations segment.
In January2001, the Company divested its Jackson Dome carbon dioxide reserve and associated pipeline for cash proceeds of approximately $42million resulting in an insignificant gain. The Jackson Dome carbon dioxide reserve and associated pipeline was reflected in the operating results of the Gas Operations segment.
In May2000, the Company completed the sale of its equity investment in Bhoruka GasesLtd., a regional industrial gas distributor in India. Proceeds from the sale, including a note receivable, were $1.1million. The investment was sold for a loss of approximately $1.7million, which had been provided for under the Company's 1998 special charges. In August2000, the Company completed the sale of Superior Air ProductsLtd., also located in India. Proceeds from the sale were $6.4million and resulted in an insignificant gain. The equity investments in India were reflected in the operating results of the Distribution segment.
During fiscal 2000, the Company completed the sale of its operations in Poland and Thailand and sold a non-core medical equipment distribution business. Proceeds from the sales amounted to $55.6million and resulted in a gain of $17.5million, which was recognized in Other income, net. The operations in Poland and Thailand were reflected in the operating results of the Distribution segment.
The following table sets forth selected financial data, by business segment, related to the divested operations in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000: Years Ended March31, 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Net sales: Distribution $ 17,808 $ 22,215 $ 39,960 Gas operations 3,467 11,194 9,251 Total net sales 21,275 33,409 49,211 Operating income: Distribution 158 1,171 1,671 Gas operations 1,233 5,277 2,387 Total operating income $ 1,391 $ 6,448 $ 4,058 (3)SPECIAL CHARGES (RECOVERIES) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company announced the outsourcing of certain administrative functions to a financial shared services center to be managed and operated by an outside firm. The Company recorded a fourth quarter special charge of approximately $1.0million ("2002 Special Charge") for severance costs (workforce reduction of 125 employees) and costs related to exiting one facility associated with the fiscal 2003 transition to the shared services center.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company recorded net special charges of $3.6million. The net special charges (the "2001 Special Charges") included a charge of $8.5million related to a cost reduction plan focused on improving results at certain business units partially offset by special charge recoveries of $4.9million principally consisting of a favorable insurance settlement related to a fiscal 1997 special charge associated with the fraudulent breach of contract by a third-party supplier of refrigerant gases. The cost reduction plan included severance costs from a reduction in workforce; facility exit costs, primarily non-cancelable lease obligations, for the closure of 30 branch locations; and F-14 impairment write-downs associated with the planned divestiture of certain non-core businesses. The major components of the fiscal 2001 Special Charges were as follows: 2001 (In thousands) Severance costs $ 3,880 Facility exit costs 2,464 Impairment write-down 2,188 2001 Special Charges 8,532 Special charge recoveries (4,889 ) Special Charges, net $ 3,643 At March31, 2002 and 2001, accrued liabilities associated with the 2001 special charge were as follows: Severance costs Facility exit costs Divestitures Total (In thousands) 2001 Special Charges $ 3,880 $ 2,464 $ 2,188 $ 8,532 Cash payments (913 ) (34 )  (947 ) Incurred losses (240 )  (2,188 ) (2,428 ) March31, 2001 liability $ 2,727 $ 2,430 $  $ 5,157 Cash payments (2,162 ) (289 )  (2,451 ) Change in estimates (565 ) (392 )  (957 ) March31, 2002 liability $  $ 1,749 $  $ 1,749 During fiscal 2002, the Company reduced its estimate related to severance and facility exit costs associated with the 2001 cost reduction plan by approximately $1.0million. The change in estimate was recorded as a recovery in fiscal 2002 through the Special charges (recoveries) line in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The liability for facility exit costs at March31, 2002 relates to non-cancelable lease obligations that will be reduced over future periods as lease payments are made over the remaining terms of the leases.
Special charge recoveries in fiscal 2000 primarily consist of recoveries of $2.8million from an insurance settlement related to a fiscal 1997 special charge associated with the fraudulent breach of contract by a third-party supplier of refrigerant gases.
F-15 (4)EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding during the period. Outstanding shares consist of issued shares less treasury stock and common stock held by the Employee Benefits Trust. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average common shares outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents related to stock options, warrants and contingently issuable shares.
The table below reconciles basic weighted average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the three years ended March31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: Years Ended March31, 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 68,100 66,000 69,200 Stock options and warrants 1,800 600 1,000 Contingently issuable shares  600 400 Diluted 69,900 67,200 70,600 Contingently issuable shares represent the required issuance of Company common stock in connection with a prior year acquisition.

If the FIFO inventory method had been used for these inventories, they would have been $1.3million and $1.5million higher at March31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Substantially all of the inventories are finished goods.
F-16 (6)PLANT AND EQUIPMENT The major classes of plant and equipment, at cost, are as follows: March31, Depreciable Lives (Yrs) 2002 2001 (In thousands) Land and land improvements  $ 36,452 $ 24,739 Buildings and leasehold improvements 25 118,243 103,002 Cylinders 30 645,298 486,909 Machinery and equipment, including bulk tanks 7 to 30 352,368 318,757 Computers and furniture and fixtures 3 to 10 86,234 76,679 Transportation equipment 3 to 15 60,818 54,950 Construction in progress  9,588 8,216 $ 1,309,001 $ 1,073,252 (7)GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS As described in Note1, the Company adopted SFAS142 as of April1, 2001. The following table reconciles the reported operating income, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, earnings before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and net income for fiscal 2001 and 2000 to their respective pro forma balances adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization expense, which is no longer recognized under the provisions of SFAS142. Fiscal 2002 results, adjusted for a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, are presented for comparative purposes.
F-17 Years Ended March31, 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands, except per share amounts) Operating income: Distribution segment $ 103,430 $ 85,907 $ 95,248 Gas Operations segment 21,603 22,042 11,483 Total reported operating income 125,033 107,949 106,731 Add back: Distribution goodwill amortization  12,320 11,943 Add back: Gas Operations goodwill amortization.

These intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements entered into in connection with business combinations and are amortized over the term of the agreements, principally five years. There are no expected residual values related to these intangible assets. Estimated future amortization expense by fiscal year is as follows ($ in millions): 2003$6.6; 2004$6.2; 2005$4.3; 2006$3.7 and $4.9 thereafter.
F-19 (8)ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES Accrued expenses and other current liabilities include: March31, 2002 2001 (In thousands) Cash overdraft $ 7,419 $ 24,445 Accrued payroll and employee benefits 32,443 24,989 Business insurance reserves 13,266 10,043 Health insurance reserves 7,628 5,553 Accrued interest expense 17,255 6,539 Litigation reserves 11,292 8,007 Other accrued expenses and current liabilities 47,087 51,297 $ 136,390 $ 130,873 The cash overdraft is attributable to the float of the Company's outstanding checks. The litigation reserves in both fiscal years primarily relate to defense and settlement costs associated with the Praxair litigation (see Note21).
(9)INDEBTEDNESS (a) Long-term Debt Long-term debt consists of: March31, 2002 2001 (In thousands) Revolving credit borrowings $ 229,309 $ 414,983 Term loan 100,000  Medium-term notes 181,275 225,000 Senior subordinated notes 222,864  Acquisition and other notes 33,132 53,626 Total long-term debt 766,580 693,609 Less current portion of long-term debt (2,456 ) (72,945 ) Long-term debt, excluding current portion $ 764,124 $ 620,664 Revolving Credit Facilities On July30, 2001, the Company refinanced its existing revolving credit facilities due December5, 2002. The refinanced credit facilities consist of revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of lenders totaling $367.5million and $50million Canadian (US $32million), including letters of credit. The revolving credit facilities will mature on July30, 2006. At March31, 2002, the Company had borrowings under the revolving facilities of approximately $208million and $35million Canadian (US $21million). The Company also had commitments under letters of credit supported by the revolving credit facilities of approximately $38million at March31, 2002. Based on restrictions related to certain leverage ratios, the Company had additional borrowing capacity under the revolving facilities of approximately $105million at March31, 2002. The variable interest rates of the U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facilities are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Rates, respectively. At March31, 2002, the effective interest rates on borrowings under the F-20 revolving facilities were 3.98% on U.S. borrowings and 2.15% on Canadian borrowings. Certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries guarantee borrowings under the revolving facilities and foreign subsidiaries also guarantee Canadian borrowings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company's credit rating as determined by third-party credit rating agencies was lowered in response to additional indebtedness related to the Air Products acquisition (see Note2). The lower credit rating required the Company to pledge 100% of the stock of its domestic guarantor subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of its foreign guarantor subsidiaries for the benefit of the syndicate of lenders. If the Company's credit rating is further reduced, the Company will be required to grant a security interest in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company for the benefit of the syndicate of lenders. The revolving credit facilities also contain covenants, which include the maintenance of certain leverage ratios, a fixed charge ratio, and potential restrictions on certain additional borrowings, the payment of dividends and the repurchase of common stock.
Term Loan In connection with the Air Products acquisition in February2002, the Company amended its revolving credit facilities to permit the acquisition and obtained a $100million term loan from a syndicate of lenders. The term loan is due in quarterly installments beginning June30, 2002 with a final payment due July30, 2006. The term loan is unsecured and bears a variable interest rate based on LIBOR plus a spread related to the Company's credit rating. At March31, 2002, the effective interest rate of the term loan was 4.15%. The additional term loan along with the Company's revolving credit facilities enabled Company to finance the Air Products acquisition entirely with senior bank debt.
Medium-Term Notes At March31, 2002, the Company had the following medium-term notes outstanding: $75million of unsecured notes due March2004 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.14% and $100million of unsecured notes due September2006 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.75%.
Senior Subordinated Notes On July30, 2001, concurrent with the refinancing of its revolving credit facilities, the Company issued $225million of senior subordinated notes (the "Notes") with a maturity date of October1, 2011. The Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 9.125%, payable semi-annually on April1 and October1 of each year with the first interest payment due on April1, 2002. The Notes were sold in accordance with the provisions of Rule144A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"). In October2001, the Company exchanged the Notes for substantially similar notes that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with the Securities Act. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange. The notes contain covenants that restrict the payment of dividends, the issuance of preferred stock, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. The notes are guaranteed on a subordinated basis by each of the domestic guarantors under the revolving credit facilities.
Acquisition and Other Notes Acquisition and other notes principally represent notes issued to sellers of businesses acquired and are repayable in periodic installments. At March31, 2002, acquisition and other notes of $33million had interest rates ranging from 7.00% to 9.00%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company refinanced $20million of the acquisition notes with borrowings under its revolving credit facilities.
F-21 Aggregate Long-term Debt Maturities The aggregate maturities of long-term debt are as follows: Years Ending March31, Aggregate Maturity (In thousands) 2003 $ 2,456 2004 96,031 2005 23,143 2006 35,818 2007 385,847 Thereafter 223,285 $ 766,580 (b) Swap Agreements In managing interest rate exposure, the Company participates in 12 interest rate swap agreements with a total notional principal amount of $323million at March31, 2002. Counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements are major financial institutions. The Company monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties, and does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.
Seven swap agreements with approximately $168million in notional principal amount require the Company to make fixed interest payments based on an average effective rate of 6.64% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparties based on three month LIBOR (average rate of 1.93% at March31, 2002.) The remaining terms of these swap agreements range from between three months and three years. Five swap agreements with approximately $155million in notional principal amount require the Company to make variable interest payments based on six month LIBOR (average rate of 3.78% at March31, 2002) and receive fixed interest payments from its counterparties based on an average effective rate of 8.05% at March31, 2002. The remaining terms of these swap agreements range from between one and nine years. Under the terms of one of the swap agreements, the Company has elected to receive the discounted value of the counterparty's interest payments up front. At March31, 2002, $424thousand of such payments was included in other current liabilities. The effect of the swap agreements was to increase interest expense by approximately $2.9million, $1.6million and $3.2million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The aggregate maturities of the Company's interest rate swaps by type of swap for the five years ending March31, 2007 and thereafter are as follows: Notional Principal Amounts Years Ending March31, Pay-Fixed Pay-Variable (In thousands) 2003 $ 127,500 $  2004  30,000 2005 40,000  2006   2007  50,000 Thereafter  75,000 $ 167,500 $ 155,000 F-22 (10)FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Summarized below are the carrying and fair values of the Company's financial instruments at March31, 2002 and 2001.
The fair value of the Company's financial instruments is based on estimates using standard pricing models that take into account the present value of future cash flows as of the balance sheet date. The computation of fair values of these instruments is generally performed by the Company. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for trade receivables and payables, accrued liabilities, accrued income taxes, and short-term borrowings approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the table below.
2002 Carrying Value 2002 Fair Value 2001 Carrying Value 2001 Fair Value (In thousands) Financial Instruments: Revolving credit borrowings $ 229,309 $ 229,309 $ 414,983 $ 414,983 Senior subordinated notes 222,864 234,000   Term loan 100,000 100,000   Medium-term notes 181,275 175,000 225,000 218,661 Acquisition and other notes 33,132 33,094 53,626 53,013 Prepaid interest rate swap agreements 424 680 1,441 1,970 Interest rate swap agreements: Fair value hedge (4,140 ) (4,140 )  (5,951 ) Cash flow hedge 4,924 4,924  6,664 (11)DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company's involvement with derivative instruments is limited to highly effective fixed and floating interest rate swap agreements used to manage well-defined interest rate risk exposures. Interest rate swap agreements are not entered into for trading purposes. As described in Note1, the Company adopted SFAS133 as of April1, 2001.
F-23 At March31, 2002, the Company had a notional amount of $168million in fixed interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a corresponding amount of variable interest rate borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and operating leases to fixed interest rate instruments. In fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a net change in the fair value of the fixed interest rate swap agreements of $1.7million as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The net additional interest payments made under these swap agreements during the quarter were recognized in interest expense. Over the next 12months, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $2.7million of the deferred loss from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense as swap agreements mature.
At March31, 2002, the Company also had a notional amount of $155million in variable interest rate swap agreements that effectively converts a corresponding amount of fixed rate medium-term and senior subordinated notes to variable rate debt. The fair value of these variable interest rate swap agreements and the increased carrying value of the hedged portions of the medium-term and senior subordinated notes at March31, 2002 was $4.1million. The changes in the fair value of the swap agreements are offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged portions of the medium-term and senior subordinated notes.
(12)TRADE RECEIVABLES SECURITIZATION The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $175million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement expires in December2003, but the initial term is subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. During fiscal 2002, the Company sold, net of its retained interest, $1.71billion of trade receivables and remitted to bank conduits, pursuant to a servicing agreement, $1.58billion in collections on those receivables. The net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $134million at March31, 2002 and $73million at March31, 2001. Proceeds received by the Company pursuant to the securitization agreement were used to reduce borrowings on its revolving credit facilities.
The transaction has been accounted for as a sale under the provisions of SFAS No.140 , Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities . Under the securitization agreement, eligible trade receivables are sold to bank conduits through a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity, which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The difference between the proceeds from the sale and the carrying value of the receivables is recognized as discount on securitization of trade receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings and varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. The Company retains a subordinated interest in the receivables sold, which is recorded at the receivables' previous carrying value. A subordinated retained interest of approximately $41million and $26million is included in Trade receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at March31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In accordance with a servicing agreement, the Company will continue to service, administer and collect the trade receivables on behalf of the bank conduits. The servicing fees charged to the bank conduits approximate the costs of collections. The Company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts on trade receivables that it retains.
(13)STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (a) Common Stock The Company is authorized to issue up to 200million shares of common stock with a par value of $.01 per share. At March31, 2002, the number of shares of common stock outstanding was 70.3million, excluding 547thousand shares of common stock held as treasury stock and 4.3million shares of common stock held in a grantor trust as described under Note13(d).
F-24 (b) Preferred Stock and Redeemable Preferred Stock The Company is authorized to issue up to 20million shares of preferred stock. Of the 20million shares authorized, 200thousand shares have been designated as SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock and 200thousand shares have been designated as SeriesB Junior Participating Preferred Stock (see Note13(e) for further discussion). At March31, 2002 and 2001, no shares of the preferred stock were issued or outstanding. The preferred stock may be issued from time to time by the Company's Board of Directors in one or more series. The Board of Directors is authorized to fix the dividend rights and terms, conversion rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, liquidation preferences, and any other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any series of preferred stock, and the number of shares constituting each such series and designation thereof.
Additionally, the Company is authorized to issue 30thousand shares of redeemable preferred stock. At March31, 2002 and 2001, no shares were issued or outstanding.
(c) Treasury Stock In March1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to sevenmillion shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. The authorization provided for the repurchase of shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions and other factors. In accordance with the March1999 share repurchase authorization, the Company acquired 31thousand, 1.4million and 5.3million shares of common stock in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In fiscal 2001 and 2000, the Company reissued 2million and 4.2million shares of common stock to the Company's Employee Benefits Trust (the "Trust"), as discussed in Note13(d). No shares were reissued from treasury in fiscal 2002. When treasury shares are reissued, the Company uses an average cost method with the excess of the repurchase cost over the reissuance price accounted for as a charge to capital in excess of par value. The Company's stock repurchase program has been completed.
(d) Shares in Employee Benefits Trust In March1999, the Company established the grantor Trust to fund certain future obligations of the Company's employee benefit and compensation plans. The Company, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, sold shares of common stock to the Trust. The Company holds promissory notes from the Trust in the amount of each purchase. Shares held by the Trust serve as collateral for the promissory notes and are available to fund employee benefit plan obligations as the promissory notes are repaid. The shares held by the Trust are not considered outstanding for earnings per share purposes until they are released from serving as collateral for the promissory notes. An independent third-party financial institution serves as the Trustee. The Trustee votes or tenders shares held by the Trust in accordance with instructions received from the participants in the employee benefit and compensation plans to be funded by the Trust. Since inception of the Trust in fiscal 1999, the Trust purchased approximately seven million shares of common stock, previously held as treasury stock, from the Company, for approximately $54million. Approximately 1.4million, 1.2million and 230thousand shares were issued from the Trust for employee benefit programs during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
(e) Stockholder Rights Plan Effective April1, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a new stockholder rights plan (the "1997 Rights Plan"). Pursuant to the 1997 Rights Plan, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right for each share of common stock. Each right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share SeriesB Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an initial exercise price of $100 per share.
F-25 Rights become exercisable only following the acquisition by a person or group of 15percent (or 20percent in the case of the Chairman and certain of his affiliates) or more of the Company's common stock or after the announcement of a tender offer or exchange offer to acquire 15percent (or 20percent in the case of the Chairman and certain of his affiliates) or more of the outstanding common stock. If such a person or group acquires 15percent or more (or 20percent or more, as the case may be) of the common stock, each right (other than such person's or group's rights, which will become void) will entitle the holder to purchase, at the exercise price, common stock having a market value equal to twice the exercise price. In certain circumstances, the rights may be redeemed by the Company. If not redeemed, they will expire on April1, 2007.
(f) Warrants During fiscal 2002, the Company granted warrants to purchase 324,000 shares of the Company's common stock to an outside consulting firm for services rendered. The warrants have a term of three years from the date of grant and have exercise prices in excess of market value on the date of grant ranging from $11.98 to $18.78 per share. The aggregate value of the warrants on the dates of grant, as determined by the Black-Scholes model, was $1.1million, which the Company expensed during fiscal 2002.
(14)STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company has elected to continue to account for its stock-based compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , as permitted by SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation . Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its stock option and employee stock purchase plans. However, pro forma information regarding net earnings and earnings per share is required. Had compensation expense for the Company's stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant date, the Company's pro forma net earnings and earnings per share for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 would be as follows: Years Ended March31, 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands, except per share amounts) Net earnings (loss) As reported $ (10,415 ) $ 28,223 $ 38,283 Pro forma $ (17,085 ) $ 22,142 $ 32,602 Diluted earnings (loss) per share As reported $ (0.15 ) $ ..42 $ ..54 Pro forma $ (0.24 ) $ .33 $ .46 The pro forma impact only takes into account options granted since April1, 1995 and is likely to have a greater impact in future years as additional options are granted and amortized ratably over the vesting period.
The Company's stock-based compensation plans are described below.
(a) Employee Stock Option Plans The Company has a stock plan under which officers and key employees may be granted options. In May1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Plan"). The 1997 Plan replaced the previous 1984 Stock Option Plan. Options granted under the 1997 Plan vest 25% annually and have a maximum term of ten years. Under the 1997 Plan, at March31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, 2.6million, 3.7million and 5.4million options, respectively, were available for issuance. In fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, 1.5million, 1.7million and 1.1million options, respectively, were granted with an F-26 exercise price equal to market price at the date of grant. Options under the 1997 Plan are generally granted in May of each year.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 option grants, respectively: expected volatility of 48.8%, 51.1% and 44.2%, risk-free interest rate of 4.7%, 6.5% and 5.6%, and expected life of 7.2, 5.6 and 4.9years. The weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $5.31, $3.13 and $5.19, respectively.
The following table summarizes the activity of the employee stock option plans during the three years ended March31, 2002: Number of Shares Exercise Price PerShare March31, 2000 Outstanding, beginning of year 7,209,520 $ 1.83 - $ 23.25 Granted 1,126,845 6.06 - 12.50 Exercised (576,772 ) 1.83 - 11.32 Expired (489,932 ) 6.31 - 22.00 March31, 2001 Outstanding, beginning of year 7,269,661 1.83 - 23.25 Granted 1,734,215 4.63 - 8.25 Exercised (397,494 ) 1.83 - 8.50 Expired (300,421 ) 5.21 - 22.00 March31, 2002 Outstanding, beginning of year 8,305,961 1.83 - 23.25 Granted 1,525,120 8.54 - 19.45 Exercised (1,049,173 ) 1.83 - 19.00 Expired (556,798 ) 5.50 - 22.00 Outstanding, end of year 8,225,110 $ 3.30 - $ 23.25 Options for 4.7million, 4.9million and 4.6million shares were exercisable at March31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
(b) Board of Directors Stock Option Plans The Company also maintains stock option plans covering directors who are not employees. In May1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Directors' Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Directors' Plan"). The 1997 Directors' Plan replaced the previous 1989 Stock Option Plan for Directors. The 1997 Directors' Plan reserved 500thousand shares for issuance. Options under the 1997 Directors' Plan are exercisable in full on the date of grant.
Under the 1997 Directors' Plan, at March31, 2002, 173,500 options were available for issuance. During fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, 80,000, 100,000 and 62,500 options, respectively, were granted with an exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten years.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 option grants, respectively: expected volatility of 51.1%, 51.1% and 44.8%, risk-free interest rate of 4.6%, 6.1% and 5.8%, and expected life of 5.7, 5.6 and 5.4years. The weighted average fair value per share of the stock options granted during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $6.61, $2.85 and $6.01, respectively.
F-27 The following table summarizes the activity of the Board of Directors stock option plans during the three years ended March31, 2002: Number of Shares Exercise Price PerShare March31, 2000 Outstanding, beginning of year 314,000 $ 2.09 - $ 19.25 Granted 62,500 12.25 Exercised (16,000 ) 2.20 March31, 2001 Outstanding, beginning of year 360,500 2.09 - 19.25 Granted 100,000 5.25 Exercised (32,000 ) 2.09 - 2.14 March31, 2002 Outstanding, beginning of year 428,500 2.09 - 19.25 Granted 80,000 12.40 Exercised (32,000 ) 2.09 - 13.82 Outstanding, end of year 476,500 $ 4.16 - $ 19.25 Options for 476,500, 428,500 and 360,500 shares were exercisable at March31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The following table summarizes information about options outstanding and exercisable for the employee and Board of Directors stock option plans at March31, 2002: Options Outstanding Weighted Average Remaining Life Number Outstanding Exercise Price Per Share 1.89 594,134 $ 3.30 - $ 5.25 8.13 1,258,380 5.44 - 5.50 4.60 1,329,057 5.56 - 8.50 8.89 1,437,170 8.54 - 8.99 5.99 1,145,269 9.29 - 11.50 4.47 1,491,642 11.98 - 15.63 5.15 1,006,350 15.94 - 21.25 4.16 439,608 22.00 - 23.25 5.84 8,701,610 $ 3.30 - $ 23.25 F-28 Options Exercisable Number of Options Exercisable Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share 592,072 $ 3.89 252,762 5.50 989,949 7.26 41,250 8.56 666,305 11.43 1,427,642 14.41 814,771 16.63 439,608 22.05 5,224,359 $ 11.99 (c)Employee Stock Purchase Plans In August2001, the Company established the Airgas,Inc. 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "2001 Plan") to encourage and assist employees in acquiring an equity interest in the Company. The 2001 Plan replaced the previous 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "1998 Plan"). During fiscal 2002, the remaining shares of common stock authorized under the 1998 Plan were issued. The 2001 Plan is authorized to issue up to 1.5million shares of common stock. Eligible employees may elect to have up to 15% of their annual gross earnings withheld to purchase common stock at 85% of the market value. Market value under the 2001 Plan is defined as either the closing share price on the New York Stock Exchange as of the employees' enrollment date or the closing price on the last business day of a fiscal quarter, whichever is lower. An employee may lock-in a purchase price for up to 27months. The 2001 Plan is designed to comply with the requirements of Sections421 and 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The terms of the Company's previous 1998 Plan were substantially identical to the terms of the 2001 Plan. During fiscal 2002, the Company issued 1.1million shares, provided from the Employee Benefits Trust, to fund purchases made by employees under the 2001 and 1998 Plans at an average purchase price of $6.58 per share. During fiscal 2001, the Company issued 1.2million shares from the Employee Benefits Trust for the 1998 Plan at an average purchase price of $4.86 per share. During fiscal 2000, the Company issued 806thousand shares from the Employee Benefits Trust and treasury stock for the 1998 Plan at an average purchase price of $7.09 per share.
Compensation expense under SFAS123 is measured based on the fair value of the employees' option to purchase shares of common stock at the grant date and is recognized over the future periods in which the related employee service is rendered. The fair value of the employees' option to purchase shares of common stock is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the employees' option to purchase shares of common stock at grant dates in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, were: average expected volatility of 61%, 63% and 51%, average risk-free interest rate of 2.6%, 5.4% and 6.0%, and expected option terms ranging from 3 to 27months. Had the Company adopted SFAS123, compensation expense related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plans would have been $4.1million, $1.7million, and $3.7million in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
(15)INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES The Company's investments in unconsolidated affiliates totaled approximately $65million at March31, 2002, and $63million at March31, 2001. The Company's investments include a 47% joint venture interest in the voting capital stock of National Welders. National Welders is a distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases and related equipment based in Charlotte, North Carolina. On F-29 February28, 2002, National Welders purchased Air Products' packaged gas operations in the Carolinas and southern Virginia. These operations have annual revenues of approximately $17million. The investment in National Welders totaled approximately $57million at March31, 2002 and $55million at March31, 2001. The Company's other investments in unconsolidated affiliates totaled approximately $8million at March31, 2002 and 2001 and primarily consist of a 50% joint venture interest in AC Industries.
The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated affiliates by the equity method of accounting, as described in Note1. The Company's share of earnings from all unconsolidated affiliates was $3.8million, $2.3million, $3.4million for the years ended March31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.
A summary of unaudited financial information for investments in unconsolidated affiliates for the years ended March31, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: March31, 2002 2001 (In thousands) Current assets $ 39,704 $ 44,731 Non-current assets 144,439 121,852 Total assets $ 184,143 $ 166,583 Current liabilities $ 24,942 $ 29,441 Non-current liabilities 105,474 91,798 Stockholders' equity 53,727 45,344 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 184,143 $ 166,583 Years Ended March31, 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Net sales $ 166,702 $ 182,630 $ 193,335 Cost of sales 105,476 118,244 126,249 Gross profit 61,226 64,386 67,086 Earnings before taxes 13,409 13,086 13,571 Net earnings 8,725 9,162 9,428 Preferred stock dividends and equity earnings adjustments (4,890 ) (6,902 ) (6,037 ) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 3,835 $ 2,260 $ 3,391 The Company's fiscal 2002 equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates reflects the Company's adoption of FAS142 under which the carrying value of the Company's investment in excess of its unconsolidated affiliates' underlying equity is no longer amortized. See Note7 for a reconciliation of prior period results as reported to results adjusted to exclude this amortization expense.
F-30 (16)INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest expense, net, consists of: Years Ended March31, 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Interest expense $ 48,035 $ 61,434 $ 58,712 Interest and finance charge income (1,022 ) (1,227 ) (1,152 ) $ 47,013 $ 60,207 $ 57,560 (17)INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle were derived from the following sources: Years Ended March31, 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) United States $ 74,947 $ 46,021 $ 69,028 Foreign 3,444 2,920 1,396 $ 78,391 $ 48,941 $ 70,424 Income tax expense (benefit) consists of: Years Ended March31, 2002 2001 2000 (In thousands) Current: Federal $ (6,693 ) $ 12,286 $ 16,554 Foreign 1,534 1,135 408 State 387 2,145 1,466 (4,772 ) 15,566 18,428 Deferred: Federal 32,348 6,173 10,325 Foreign 329 594 847 State 1,901 (1,615 ) 1,951 34,578 5,152 13,123 $ 29,806 $ 20,718 $ 31,551 As of March31, 2002, the Company has reflected a tax refund receivable of $27.7million in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. The tax refund was principally the result of the 2002 Job Creation and Work Assistance Act ("the Act"), which provided for a 30% bonus depreciation deduction for assets placed in service after September10, 2001. As a result of the Act and the Company's significant acquisitions subsequent to September10, 2001, the Company recognized a current period tax benefit and deferred tax expense related to the bonus depreciation deduction. The bonus depreciation deduction was a principle contributor to a current net operating loss position, which the company elected to carry back to prior tax years.
F-31 Significant differences between taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes were: Years Ended March31, 2002 2001 2000 Taxes at U.S. federal statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Increase in income taxes resulting from: State income taxes, net of federal benefit 1.5 % 1.1 % 2.1 % Amortization of non-deductible goodwill 4.9 % 4.7 % Divestitures 1.8 %  2.6 % Equity accounting for unconsolidated affiliates (1.2 )% (1.1 )% (1.1 )% Other, net 0.9 % 2.4 % 1.5 % 38.0 % 42.3 % 44.8 % The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2002 is primarily related to the Company no longer amortizing goodwill as described in Notes 1 and 7.
The tax effects of cumulative temporary differences that gave rise to the significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: March31, 2002 2001 (In thousands) Deferred Tax Assets: Inventories $ 5,955 $ 5,852 Accounts receivable (124 ) 406 Deferred rental income 959 528 Insurance reserves 7,573 4,391 Special charges (Note3) 1,581 5,396 Litigation settlement and other reserves 6,406 1,649 Intangible assets (5,907 ) (71 ) Other 14,365 11,523 Valuation allowance (5,976 ) (4,263 ) 24,832 25,411 Deferred Tax Liabilities: Plant and equipment (194,703 ) (160,000 ) Other (15,092 ) (16,444 ) (209,795 ) (176,444 ) Net deferred tax liability $ (184,963 ) $ (151,033 ) F-32 Current tax assets and current tax liabilities have been netted for presentation purposes. Non-current tax assets and non-current tax liabilities have also been netted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as follows: March31, 2002 2001 (In thousands) Current deferred tax asset, net $ 13,210 $ 10,143 Non-current deferred tax liability, net (198,173 ) (161,176 ) Net deferred tax liability $ (184,963 ) $ (151,033 ) The Company has recorded tax benefits amounting to $4.3million, $800thousand and $1.6million in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, resulting from the exercise of stock options. This benefit has been recorded in capital in excess of par value.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances, at March31, 2002. Valuation allowances which increased by $1.7million in fiscal year 2002, primarily relate to certain state tax net operating loss carry forwards.
(18)BENEFIT PLANS The Company has a defined contribution 401(k) plan (the "401(k) plan") covering substantially all full-time employees. Under the terms of the 401(k) plan, the Company makes matching contributions up to two percent of participants' wages plus additional discretionary profit sharing contributions based upon the profitability of the Company. Amounts expensed under the 401(k) plan for fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000 were $4.7million, $5.8million and $5.9million, respectively.
Certain subsidiaries of the Company participate in multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans which provide defined benefits to union employees. Contributions are made to the plans in accordance with negotiated labor contracts. The Company has not taken any action to terminate or withdraw from these plans. Management believes that the Company's liability, if any, for multi-employer plan withdrawal liability will not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Amounts expensed under the pension plans for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $642thousand, $543thousand and $526thousand, respectively.
Effective January2002, the Company offered eligible employees the opportunity to participate in a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (the "Plan"). The Plan, which is not required to be funded, allows eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation until their retirement. The costs associated with the Plan during fiscal 2002 were not material. At March31, 2002, the Company had a liability of $100thousand related to compensation deferred and related interest under the Plan.
(19)RELATED PARTIES During the years ended March31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, National Welders, an unconsolidated equity affiliate, paid $3.8million, $3.8million and $3.5million, respectively, to the Company for gas products, hardgoods and services. In addition, National Welders sold gas products and hardgoods to the F-33 Company in the amounts of $1.1million, $787thousand and $330thousand in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In connection with the Praxair litigation (see Note21), the Company reimbursed National Welders for legal fees of $482thousand, $260thousand and $484thousand in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The Company paid $7.7million, $7.9million and $9.1million to AC Industries, an unconsolidated equity affiliate, for the purchase of liquid carbon dioxide during the years ended March31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In addition, the Company had a net payable balance to AC Industries totaling $1.2million, $1.2million and $695thousand at March31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
(20)LEASES The Company leases certain distribution facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases with varying terms. Most leases contain renewal options and in some instances, purchase options. Rentals under these long-term leases for the years ended March31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, amounted to $45.4million, $43.7million, and $38.5million, respectively. Certain operating facilities are leased at market rates from employees of the Company who were previous owners of businesses acquired. The Company also has several capital leases assumed as part of prior acquisitions. Outstanding capital lease obligations and the related capital assets are not material to the consolidated balance sheets at March31, 2002 and 2001.
The Company leases real estate and certain equipment from a trust established by a commercial bank. The operating leases are structured as a sale-leaseback transaction in which the trust holds title to the properties and equipment included in the leases. The rental payments are based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin and the cost of the property acquired by the trust. At March31, 2002, the non-cancelable lease obligation of the real estate and equipment leases totaled approximately $43million. The lease terms expire in October2004. The Company has guaranteed a residual value of the real estate and the equipment at the end of the lease terms of approximately $30million. A gain of approximately $12million on the equipment portion of the transaction has been deferred until the expiration of the Company's guarantee of the residual value.
At March31, 2002, future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases, including the residual value associated with the sale-leaseback transaction, are as follows: (In thousands) 2003 $ 37,900 2004 31,040 2005 65,710 2006 19,517 2007 13,889 Thereafter 15,418 $ 183,474 (21)COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (a) Legal In July1996, Praxair,Inc. ("Praxair") filed suit against the Company in the Circuit Court of Mobile County, Alabama, alleging tortious interference with business or contractual relations with respect to Praxair's right of first refusal agreement with the majority shareholders of National Welders in connection with the Company's formation of a joint venture with National Welders. In June1998, Praxair filed a motion to dismiss its own action in Alabama and commenced another action in the F-34 Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, alleging substantially the same tortious interference by the Company. The North Carolina action also alleged breach of contract against National Welders and certain shareholders of National Welders and unfair trade practices and conspiracy against all the defendants. In April2002, the Company and Praxair entered into an agreement to settle the litigation in order to avoid the time and expense of a lengthy trial. Each party denied any wrongdoing or liability and Praxair agreed to an early termination of the right of first refusal. As a result of the settlement, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a charge to earnings, net of previously established reserves related to the litigation, of $8.5million. In fiscal 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $6.9million for costs associated with defending the Praxair lawsuit.
In fiscal 1997, the Company announced it was the victim of a fraudulent breach of contract by a third-party supplier of refrigerant gases and recorded a special charge related to product losses and costs associated with the Company's efforts to investigate the fraud and pursue recoveries. In March2001, the Company reached a final settlement with its insurance carriers resulting in insurance recoveries of $4million. The insurance settlement, net of associated legal expenses, was reflected in special charge recoveries in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
In fiscal 2000, the Company recorded a $7.5million charge representing an estimate of the overall costs associated with the defense and settlement of certain class action lawsuits pertaining to hazardous material charges paid to the Company by customers. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, a settlement agreement and approving court orders covering all such class actions against the Company became final, and the Company reversed $1.1million of the previously accrued defense and settlement costs.
The Company is involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of its business and have not been fully adjudicated. These actions, when ultimately concluded and determined, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect upon the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
(b) Insurance Coverage The Company has established insurance programs to cover workers' compensation, business automobile, general and products liability. These programs have self-insured retention of $500thousand per occurrence and an aggregate limit of $1.5million for claims in excess of $500thousand. The Company believes its insurance reserves are adequate. The Company accrues estimated losses using actuarial models and assumptions based on historical loss experience.
The nature of the Company's business may subject it to product and general liability lawsuits. To the extent that the Company is subject to claims that exceed its liability insurance coverage of $100million, such suits could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
(c) Supply Agreements In connection with the Air Products acquisition, the Company entered into a 15-year supply agreement under which Air Products will supply at least 35% of the Company's bulk liquid nitrogen, oxygen and argon requirements. Additionally, the Company has commitments to purchase helium under the terms of the supply agreement. Based on fiscal 2002 results, the Air Products supply agreement represents approximately $40million in annual liquid bulk gas purchases. In addition, the Company is a party to other long-term supply agreements primarily for the purchase of liquid carbon dioxide, representing approximately $14million, or 24% of the Company's annual carbon dioxide requirements.

The Distribution segment accounts for approximately 90% of consolidated sales. The segment's principal products and services are packaged and small bulk gases, gas cylinder and welding equipment rental and hardgoods. Gas sales include industrial, medical and specialty gases such as: nitrogen, oxygen, argon, helium, acetylene, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, hydrogen, welding gases, ultra high purity grades and special application blends. Rent is derived from gas cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk storage tanks and through the rental of welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding supplies and equipment, safety products, and industrial tools and supplies.
The Gas Operations segment produces and distributes certain gas products, principally dry ice, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and specialty gases. The Company also operates two air separation plants that produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon which are sold to on-site customers and to the Distribution segment.
The Company's operations are principally in the United States. The Company's customer base is diverse and sales are not dependent on a single or small group of customers.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Note1). Additionally, Corporate operating expenses are allocated to each segment pro rata based on sales dollars; Corporate assets have been allocated to the Distribution segment; intercompany sales are recorded on the same basis as sales to third parties; and intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. As a result of adopting SFAS142 effective April1, 2001, the financial results for the year ended March31, 2002 do not reflect goodwill amortization expense (see Note1). See Note7 for a reconciliation of prior period financial results as reported to financial results adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization expense. See Note2 for the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the operating results of each segment. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods segment disclosures to conform to the current presentation.
Management utilizes more than one measurement and multiple views of data to measure segment performance and to allocate resources to the segments. However, the dominant measurements are consistent with the Company's consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, are reported on the same basis herein. Management evaluates the performance of its segments primarily based on sales, F-36 operating income, EBITDA (operating income plus equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, depreciation and amortization) and overall economic returns.

(c) As discussed in the Notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements, net earnings for fiscal 2001 include the following charges in the fourth quarter: (1)net special charges of $2.3million after tax, or $.03 per diluted share; (2)litigation charges, net of recoveries, of $3.4 or $.06 per diluted share; and (3)asset impairments associated with two equity affiliates of $700thousand after tax, or $.01 per diluted share.
(25)CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS As described in Note9, on July30, 2001, the Company refinanced its revolving credit facilities and issued $225million of senior subordinated notes (the "Notes"). The obligations of the Company under the Notes are guaranteed by the Company's domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the Company's revolving credit facilities (the "Guarantors"). The Company's joint venture operations, foreign holdings and bankruptcy remote special purpose entity (the "Non-guarantors") are not guarantors of the Notes. The guarantees are made on a joint and several basis. The claims of creditors of Non-guarantor subsidiaries have priority over the rights of the Company to receive dividends or distributions from such subsidiaries. Presented below is condensed consolidating financial information for the Company, the Guarantors and the Non-guarantors as of March31, 2002 and March31, 2001 and for the years ended March31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. On August31, 2001, two Non-guarantor entities were merged into the parent. These entities were holding companies through which the Company managed its operations in Poland and Thailand. The operations in Poland and Thailand were divested in fiscal 2000. The net assets of the two Non-guarantor entities in the amount of $42.7million were transferred to the parent.
