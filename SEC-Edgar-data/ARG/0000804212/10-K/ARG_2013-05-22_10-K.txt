BUSINESS.  GENERAL       Airgas, Inc. and subsidiaries ("Airgas" or the "Company") is the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases (delivered in "packaged" or cylinder form), and welding, safety and related products ("hardgoods").  Airgas also produces dry ice, liquid carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and specialty gases for distribution throughout the United States.  Airgas' integrated network of approximately 700 locations includes branches, retail stores, packaged gas fill plants, specialty gas labs, production facilities and distribution centers.  Airgas also distributes its products and services to its diversified customer base through eBusiness, catalog and telemarketing channels.  Sales were $1.63 billion, $1.54 billion and $1.56 billion in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.       The Company's two operating segments are Distribution and Gas Operations.  Financial information by business segment can be found in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" ("MD&A"), and Note 22 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."  Descriptions of the operating segments are as follows:  DISTRIBUTION       The Distribution segment accounts for approximately 90% of consolidated sales and reflects the distribution of industrial, medical and specialty gases, and hardgoods.  The Distribution segment also includes the equity affiliate earnings related to the Company's joint venture with National Welders Supply Company, Inc., which is a producer and distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases and hardgoods.  Principal Products and Services       The Distribution segment's principal products and services include packaged and small bulk gases, gas cylinder and welding equipment rental and hardgoods.  Gas sales include industrial, medical and specialty gases such as: nitrogen, oxygen, argon, helium, acetylene, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, hydrogen, welding gases, ultra high purity grades and special application blends.  Rent is derived from gas cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk storage tanks and through the rental of welding equipment.  Gas and rent represented approximately 44%, 42%, and 40% of the Distribution segment's sales in each of the fiscal years 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.  Hardgoods consist of welding supplies and equipment, safety products, and industrial tools and supplies.  In each of the fiscal years 2001, 2000, and 1999, hardgoods sales represented approximately 56%, 58%, and 60% of the Distribution segment's sales, respectively (see Note 22 of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding segment sales).  Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution       The Company believes the market for industrial, medical and specialty gases in the United States is approximately $9.4 billion annually.  The industry has three principal modes of distribution: on- site supply, bulk or merchant supply and cylinder ("packaged gas") supply.  In the U.S. market, on-site supply accounts for approximately 25% of sales, bulk or merchant supply accounts for approximately 35% of sales, and packaged gas supply accounts for the remaining 40% or $3.8 billion in sales.  Airgas' market focus has been on the packaged gas segment of the market and on small bulk customers.  Generally, packaged gas distributors also distribute welding products.  The Company believes the U.S. market for welding products to be approximately $3.9 billion annually.
4      Airgas is the largest distributor of packaged gases and welding products in the United States with approximately a 15% market share. The Company's competitors in this market are approximately 900 independent distributors that serve approximately 50% of the market through a fragmented distribution network.  Large distributors, including vertically integrated gas producers such as Praxair, Inc. ("Praxair"), Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. ("Air Products"), Liquid Air Corporation of America ("Air Liquide"), and BOC Gases Group ("BOC Gases"), serve the remaining 35% of the packaged gas market.  The Company also sells safety equipment.  The United States market for safety equipment is approximately $6 billion, of which Airgas' share is approximately 4%.  Customer Base       The Company's customer base is broad and includes many major industries.  The Company estimates the following industry segments account for the indicated percentages of the Company's total sales:        o  Manufacturing (49%) - principally producers of fabricated metal          products (15%), industrial and transportation equipment (9%),          chemical products (5%), and primary metal products (5%);       o  Service Sector (11%) - principally medical and health services (7%);       o  Wholesale Trade (10%),       o  Agriculture and Mining (8%);       o  Construction (7%); and       o  All Other (15%).  Suppliers       The Company purchases industrial, medical and specialty gases pursuant to requirements contracts from national and regional producers of industrial gases.  The Company also manufactures certain gases, including acetylene, nitrous oxide, nitrogen, oxygen and argon.  The Company believes, that if a contractual arrangement with any supplier of gases or other raw materials was terminated, it would be able to locate alternative sources of supply without disruption of service.  The Company purchases hardgoods from major manufacturers and suppliers.  For certain products, the Company has negotiated national purchasing arrangements.  GAS OPERATIONS       The Gas Operations segment produces and distributes certain gas products, principally dry ice, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and specialty gases.   The Company also operates two air separation plants that produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon which are sold to on- site customers and to the Distribution segment.  A description of the businesses included in the Gas Operations segment are as follows:  Dry Ice       The Company is a producer and distributor of dry ice in the United States.  Customers include food processors, food service, pharmaceutical and biotech industries, wholesale trade and grocery and other retail outlets.  The dry ice business generally experiences a higher level of sales in the first and second quarters of the fiscal year due to weather-related demand.  The Company's carbon dioxide requirements (dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide) are purchased from the vertically integrated producers of carbon dioxide and from internal production sources.
5 Carbon Dioxide       The Company is a producer and distributor of liquid carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide requirements are met by eight Company-owned production facilities and a 50%-owned joint venture as well as purchased from vertically integrated gas producers of carbon dioxide. The joint venture also produces and sells liquid carbon dioxide to other producers of industrial gases.  The Company believes the United States bulk supply market for liquid carbon dioxide is approximately $400 million annually.  The largest customer segments include chemical producers and oil and gas extraction.  The Company primarily competes with three major carbon dioxide companies, Praxair, BOC Gases and Air Liquide, which produce over 80% of the merchant carbon dioxide volumes in the United States.  Specialty and Other Gases       The Company operates six "A" labs, full scale testing and blending facilities, which blend various special application gas mixes, ultra high purity grade gases, pure hydrocarbon mixtures, EPA protocol gases, and vehicle emission standard gases.  Gas mixtures are used in process control, final product qualification and emissions monitoring.  Specialty gases produced are primarily sold to the Distribution segment (see Note 22 of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure related to segment sales).  The third-party customer base for these products consists primarily of environmental-related businesses, manufacturers of electronics, governmental entities, petroleum refiners, and pharmaceutical and automotive businesses.  Gas Operations also provides technical support to 27 "B" labs, limited scale testing and blending facilities, which are operated by the Distribution segment.  The "A" and "B" labs perform testing and certification services for gas purity.  Nitrous Oxide       The Company is a manufacturer of nitrous oxide gas.  Nitrous oxide is used as an anesthetic in the medical and dental fields, as a propellant in the packaged food business and is utilized in the manufacturing process of certain high technology electronics industries.  The Company's market focus includes bulk customers as well as sales to the Distribution segment.  The Company purchases the raw materials utilized in its nitrous oxide production pursuant to contracts with major manufacturers and suppliers.  Suppliers       The Company believes that, if a contractual arrangement with any Gas Operations segment supplier was terminated, it would not have a material adverse effect on operations. However, two of the Company's 15 dry ice production facilities are located on property owned by BOC Gases.  If the current arrangements with BOC Gases were terminated, the Company's dry ice production capabilities may be reduced.  AIRGAS GROWTH STRATEGIES       The Company's strategic objectives are to establish itself as the low-cost supplier in the industry and drive market-leading sales growth by leveraging its national distribution infrastructure.  To meet these objectives, the Company has established the following strategic initiatives:       o increasing market penetration by growing the strategic account        business, increasing cross-selling to existing customers,        strengthening sales leadership training and leveraging the market        presence of Puritan Medical Products (a subsidiary of the Company);      o migrating customers to the appropriate distribution channel by        leveraging the Company's safety telesales capabilities, launching the        second generation eBusiness capability and providing sales training        on channel management; 6      o improving supply chain efficiencies through optimizing the        routing and scheduling of trucks, more efficient cylinder filling and        management, controlling procurement and enhancing the operations of        the Company's five distribution centers; and      o redesigning key business processes to standardize, centralize and        implement a matrix organization structure.       These strategic objectives are designed to facilitate organic sales and earnings growth.  The Company will also continue to supplement its internal growth strategies through core business acquisitions and exiting low-return, non-core businesses.  REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS       The Company's subsidiaries are subject to federal and state laws and regulations adopted for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of employees and users of the Company's products. The Company has programs for the operation and design of its facilities to achieve compliance with applicable environmental regulations.  The Company believes that it is in compliance, in all material respects, with such laws and regulations.  Expenditures for environmental purposes during fiscal 2001 were not material.  INSURANCE       The Company has established insurance programs to cover workers' compensation, business automobile, general and product liability. These programs have self-insured retention of $500,000 per occurrence.  Estimated losses are accrued based upon the Company's experience for the aggregate liability for claims incurred and claims incurred but not reported.  The Company believes its insurance reserves are adequate.  EMPLOYEES       On March 31, 2001, the Company employed approximately 7,600 employees of whom approximately 5% were covered by collective bargaining agreements.  The Company believes it has good relations with its employees and has not experienced a significant strike or work stoppage in over ten years.  PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES       The Company holds trademark registrations for "Airgas," "Red-D- Arc," "RED-D-ARC WELDERENTAL," "Gold Gas," "Stainless Mix," "Steelmix," "Alummix," "Powersource," and "VAWELD."  The Company has trademarks pending for "RADNOR," "RADNOR Industrial Products," "RADNOR Safety Products," and "RADNOR Welding Products," its private- label product brands.  The Company believes that its businesses as a whole are not materially dependent upon any single patent, trademark or license.

The Company's Distribution segment operates a network of approximately 560 branch stores, 27 "B" gas laboratories, 15 acetylene manufacturing facilities, five regional distribution centers, 130 cylinder fill plants and various customer call centers. The Distribution segment conducts business in 44 states.  The Company owns approximately 25% of these facilities.  The remaining facilities are primarily leased from third parties.  Facilities leased from employees are on terms consistent with commercial rental rates prevailing in the surrounding rental market.       The Company's Gas Operations' segment consists of businesses, located throughout the United States, which operate approximately 40 branch locations, eight liquid carbon dioxide and 15 dry ice production facilities, two air separation plants, six "A" gas laboratories, and six nitrous oxide production facilities.  The Company owns approximately 20% of these facilities.  The remaining facilities are leased from third parties.       During fiscal 2001, the Company's production facilities operated at approximately 80% of capacity.       The Company believes that its facilities are adequate for its present needs and that its properties are generally in good condition, well maintained and suitable for their intended use.
9 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.       In July 1996, Praxair, Inc. ("Praxair") filed suit against the Company in the Circuit Court of Mobile County, Alabama.  The complaint alleged tortious interference with business or contractual relations with respect to Praxair's Right of First Refusal contract with the majority shareholders of National Welders Supply Company, Inc. ("National Welders") in connection with the Company's formation of a joint venture with National Welders.  In June 1998, Praxair filed a motion to dismiss its own action in Alabama and commenced another action in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, alleging substantially the same tortious interference by the Company.  The North Carolina action also alleges breach of contract against National Welders and certain shareholders of National Welders and unfair trade practices and conspiracy against all the defendants.  In the North Carolina action, Praxair seeks compensatory damages in excess of $10 thousand, punitive damages and other unspecified relief.  The Company anticipates that additional discovery and pretrial motions will be completed by the end of the calendar year, and that a trial on the merits will begin in April 2002. The Company believes that Praxair's North Carolina claims are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against such claims. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $6.9 million for the anticipated costs of defending the Praxair lawsuit.       In 1997, the Company announced it was the victim of a fraudulent breach of contract by a third party supplier of refrigerant gases and recorded a special charge related to product losses and costs associated with the Company's efforts to investigate the fraud and pursue recoveries.  In March 2001, the Company reached a final settlement with its insurance carriers resulting in additional insurance recoveries of $4 million.  The insurance settlement net of associated legal expenses was reflected in special charge recoveries in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.       In fiscal 2000, the Company recorded a $7.5 million charge representing an estimate of the overall costs associated with the defense and settlement of certain class action lawsuits pertaining to hazardous material charges paid to the Company by customers.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, a settlement agreement and approving court orders covering all such class actions against the Company became final, and the Company reversed $1.1 million of the previously accrued defense and settlement costs.       The Company is involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of its business and have not been fully adjudicated.  These actions, when ultimately concluded and determined, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect upon the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of      Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in the notes to      the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, the results for      fiscal 2001 include:  (a) net special charges of $3.6 million ($2.3      million after-tax), (b) litigation charges, net, of $5.3 million      ($3.4 million after-tax), and (c) asset impairments associated with      two equity affiliates of $700 thousand after-tax.  The decrease in      working capital was partially attributable to a trade receivables      securitization program entered into during fiscal 2001 and the      classification of $50 million of medium-term notes maturing September      2001 as a component of "Current Liabilities."  Cash proceeds of      approximately $73.2 million from the program were used to reduce long-      term debt.  (2)  As discussed in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of      Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in the notes to      the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, the results for      fiscal 2000 include:  (a) special charge recoveries of $2.8 million      ($1.7 million after-tax), (b) divestiture gains of $17.5 million      ($8.6 million after-tax), (c) a litigation charge of $7.5 million      ($4.8 million after-tax), (d) an inventory write-down of $3.8 million      ($2.2 million after-tax), and (e) an after-tax charge of $590      thousand representing a change in accounting principle.

(4)  The results for fiscal 1998 include:  (a) fourth quarter special      charges of $22.4 million ($14.3 million after-tax) which      consisted of severance, exit costs for the closure of duplicate      facilities, the impairment write-down of property, equipment and      related goodwill and a write-down related to the divestiture of      several non-core businesses, offset by a one-time net gain      related to an acquisition break-up fee of $3 million ($1.9      million after-tax), (b) a non-recurring gain of $14.5 million      ($9.4 million after-tax) from the partial recovery of      refrigerant losses, and (c) a non-recurring gain on the sale of      a non-core business.  (5)  In fiscal 1997, the Company recorded special charges totaling      $31.4 million ($20.2 million after-tax) related to the      fraudulent breach of contract by a third-party supplier of      refrigerant gas and an after-tax loss on the sale of a non-core      business.

13                     AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES                 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS           OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Item 7.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2001 COMPARED TO 2000  OVERVIEW       The Company's net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 were $1.63 billion compared to $1.54 billion in the prior year. Despite a slowing U.S. economy, the Company experienced positive same- store sales growth of 3.1%, continuing the same-store sales growth that began in the prior year fiscal fourth quarter.  The Company's successful strategy of leveraging its distribution network to sign new strategic accounts, pursue cross-selling opportunities and promote strategic products had a favorable impact on net sales.  In addition, net sales were positively affected by the prior year acquisition of Mallinckrodt Inc.'s Puritan-Bennett medical gas subsidiary ("Puritan Medical Products").  The Company also implemented price increases during fiscal 2001 that helped to offset rising costs related to purchased gases, salaries and wages, insurance, and distribution.  Excluding the effect of the items outlined below, net earnings were $.52 per diluted share in both fiscal 2001 and 2000.  Net earnings, as reported, for fiscal 2001 were $28.2 million, or $.42 per diluted share, compared to $38.3 million, or $.54 per diluted share, in fiscal 2000.       As discussed in the "Income Statement Commentary" below, fiscal 2001 net earnings were affected by the following:      o  net special charges of $3.6 million ($2.3 million after-tax),     o  litigation charges, net, of $5.3 million ($3.4 million after-tax), and     o  asset impairments associated with two equity affiliates of $700        thousand after-tax.  Fiscal 2000 net earnings were affected by the following:      o  special charge recoveries of $2.8 million ($1.7 million after-tax),     o  divestiture gains of $17.5 million ($8.6 million after-tax),     o  a litigation charge of $7.5 million ($4.8 million after-tax),     o  an inventory write-down of $3.8 million ($2.2 million after-tax), and     o  an after-tax charge of $590 thousand representing a change in        accounting principle.       Additionally in fiscal 2001, the Company reduced total debt by $183.9 million.  The ability to reduce debt is indicative of the strong cash flow characteristics of the Company's business.  Debt reduction resulted from cash flow from operations, divestitures and a securitization of trade receivables. Operations provided approximately $61 million, divestitures provided approximately $50 million, principally the divestiture of the Jackson Dome carbon dioxide reserves and associated pipeline ("Jackson Dome pipeline"), and the trade receivables securitization program provided approximately $73 million.
14 INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY  Net Sales       Net sales increased 5.6% in fiscal 2001 compared to 2000, driven by same-store sales growth of 3.1% and prior year acquisitions included for a full year in 2001.  The Company estimates same-store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures.
(In thousands)          2001         2000          Increase                      ----------   ----------    --------------- Distribution      $1,487,422   $1,409,949    $77,473   5.5%    Gas Operations       141,479      132,385      9,094   6.9%                      ----------   ----------    -------                      $1,628,901   $1,542,334    $86,567   5.6%                      ==========   ==========    ======= The Distribution segment's principal products and services include industrial, medical and specialty gases, equipment rental and hardgoods.  Industrial gases consist of packaged and small bulk gases.  Equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk tanks and welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding supplies and equipment, safety products, and industrial tools and supplies.  Distribution sales increased $77.5 million as a result of net acquisition and divestiture activity and same-store sales growth.  Fiscal 2001 sales increased $43.8 million from seven distributor acquisitions since April 1, 1999, partially offset by a divestiture during fiscal 2000.  The most significant of the acquisitions was that of Puritan Medical Products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.  Distribution same-store sales growth of $33.7 million (2.7%) resulted from gas and rent sales growth of $28.8 million (5.1%) and hardgoods sales growth of $4.9 million (1.0%).  Gas and rent same-store sales growth was primarily attributable to higher volumes of strategic products and continued success of certain sales initiatives, such as strategic accounts. Growth in strategic product sales resulted from expansion of the rental welder fleet and improvements in certain gas product sales including medical and specialty gases.  Price increases implemented during fiscal 2001 also contributed to gas and rent sales growth. Hardgoods same-store sales growth was driven principally by an increase in safety sales resulting from the successful cross-selling of safety products through the Company's distribution network. Although hardgoods same-store sales growth was positive in fiscal 2001, hardgoods sales slowed in the fiscal third quarter with further contraction in the fourth quarter resulting from the slowing U.S. industrial economy.       The Gas Operations segment's sales primarily include dry ice and carbon dioxide that are used for cooling, the production of food and beverages, chemical products, and oil and gas extraction.  In addition, the segment includes businesses that produce and distribute specialty gases and nitrous oxide.  Sales increased $9.1 million in fiscal 2001 compared to the prior year primarily from same-store sales growth (7.2%).  Gas Operations' same-store sales growth resulted from higher volumes of liquid carbon dioxide, dry ice and nitrous oxide.  Sales growth was also driven by price increases that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 to help offset the impact of higher energy and distribution costs.  The reduction in sales from the divestiture of the Jackson Dome pipeline in fiscal 2001 and the divestiture of operations in Poland and Thailand in fiscal 2000 were offset by nitrous oxide production businesses that were acquired with Puritan Medical Products.
15 Gross Profits Gross profits increased 7.7% in fiscal 2001 compared to 2000.  (In thousands)          2001        2000          Increase                       --------    --------    ---------------- Distribution       $689,999    $649,827    $40,172   6.2%    Gas Operations       91,702      75,910     15,792  20.8%                       --------    --------    -------                       $781,701    $725,737    $55,964   7.7%                       ========    ========    ======= Distribution gross profits increased $40.2 million resulting from net acquisition and divestiture activity and same-store gross profits growth.  Acquisition and divestiture activity accounted for a net increase in gross profits of $29.0 million, primarily from the acquisition of Puritan Medical Products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.  Same-store gross profits increased $11.2 million (2.4%) compared to the prior year.  Same-store gross profit growth consisted of a $14.4 million (3.7%) increase in gas and rent, partially offset by a decrease in hardgoods gross profits of $3.2 million. Same-store gross profits of gas and rent increased resulting from higher sales volumes and price increases implemented during fiscal 2001.  An expanded rental welder fleet also contributed to the increase in gross profits.  The Distribution segment's gross profit margin of 46.4% in fiscal 2001 increased 30 basis points from 46.1% in the prior year primarily as a result of a shift in sales mix to higher margin gases.  The shift in sales mix was driven principally by higher margin medical gases contributed by Puritan Medical Products. The decline in hardgoods same-store gross profits resulted from general weakness in certain manufacturing and industrial hardgoods markets served by the Company.  The decline in hardgoods gross profits was partially mitigated by lower costs from centralized purchasing initiatives and continued growth of higher margin private label products.  Private label products reached an annual run rate of $45 million in fiscal 2001 representing a 40% increase over the prior year.       The Gas Operations segment's gross profits increased $15.8 million primarily from same-store gross profit growth and net acquisition activity. Same-store gross profit growth of $10.5 million (13.4%) resulted primarily from higher sales volumes and price increases of dry ice, liquid carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.  Gross profits increased $1.5 million from net acquisition activity, primarily consisting of the prior year acquisition of Puritan Medical Products's nitrous oxide production businesses.  In addition, the prior year was adversely affected by an inventory write-down of $3.8 million related to certain specialty gas inventories.  Gas Operations' gross profit margin was 64.8% compared to 57.3% in the prior year.  The gross profit margin in the prior year reflects the impact of the specialty gas inventory write-down.  Operating Expenses       Selling, distribution and administrative expenses ("operating expenses") consist of personnel and related costs, distribution and warehouse costs, occupancy expenses and other selling, general and administrative expenses.  Operating expenses increased $50.8 million (9.5%) compared to the prior fiscal year primarily from net acquisition and divestiture activity and higher costs associated with personnel, distribution and insurance.  On a same-store basis, operating expenses are estimated to have increased approximately $32 million in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000.  Personnel costs were affected by rising salaries and wages driven by a competitive labor market.  Higher distribution costs resulted primarily from increases in the price of fuel and energy.  Insurance costs were driven by rising medical costs related to workers' compensation and health insurance.  The Company implemented a cost reduction plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.  The cost reduction plan focused on a reduction in workforce, the closure of 30 branch locations and the planned disposition of certain non-core businesses.  As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 35.8% from 34.5% in fiscal 2000.
16      Fiscal 2001 operating expenses included legal expenses of $7.5 million.  Fiscal 2001 legal expenses reflect litigation charges of $5.3 million, net.  The net litigation charges consist primarily of a fourth quarter charge of $6.9 million related to a lawsuit brought by a competitor, Praxair, Inc.  The charge reflects an estimate of the future costs associated with the defense of the lawsuit.  The charge was partially offset by the final settlement and reversal of $1.1 million of liabilities established in fiscal 2000 associated with the defense and settlement of class-action lawsuits related to hazardous materials charges.  Legal expenses for fiscal 2000 of $9.6 million included a $7.5 million litigation charge representing the Company's original estimate of the costs to defend against and settle the class- action lawsuits.       Fiscal 2001 operating expenses also included $2.2 million of consulting expenses related to a project focused on improving certain operational and administrative processes.  The project was initiated during the second half of fiscal 2001 and is expected to continue through fiscal 2003.  Project expenses and anticipated benefits through fiscal 2003 will be dependent on the ultimate scope and timing of the project.  Net of anticipated benefits, the Company estimates that the project will be dilutive to fiscal 2002 earnings by approximately $0.05 per diluted share and accretive to earnings in fiscal 2003.       Depreciation expense of approximately $63 million remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2000.  Amortization expense of $23.8 decreased $1.9 million (-7.2%) compared to fiscal 2000 primarily from the expiration of non-compete agreements related to prior acquisitions.  Special Charges (Recoveries)       Special charges in fiscal 2001 included a charge of $8.5 million related to a cost reduction plan implemented by the Company to improve operating results at certain business units as well as to mitigate rising operating expenses.  The fourth quarter 2001 cost reduction charge included severance costs for a reduction in workforce of 275 employees, exit costs for the closure of 30 branch locations and losses associated with the anticipated divestiture of certain non-core businesses.  The non-core businesses to be divested generated annual sales of approximately $10 million in fiscal 2001 and were included in the Company's Distribution segment.  As a result of the cost reduction plan, the Company estimates cost savings in fiscal 2002 of approximately $10 million.  The charge was partially offset by $4.9 million of special charge recoveries primarily consisting of a favorable insurance settlement associated with the fiscal 1997 special charge.  Special charge recoveries in fiscal 2000 consist of $2.8 million primarily from a favorable insurance settlement related to the fiscal 1997 special charge.  Operating Income       Operating income increased 1.1% in fiscal 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding special (charges) recoveries, operating income increased 7.4%.

17      The Gas Operations segment's operating income margin of 13.7% in fiscal 2001 increased from 7.0% in fiscal 2000.  Fiscal 2001 results benefited from higher gross profits from same-store sales growth and price increases.  The prior year was adversely affected by a $3.8 million inventory write-down of certain specialty gas inventories. Gas Operations' operating income margin was 9.8% in fiscal 2000, excluding the impact of the inventory write-down.  Interest Expense       Interest expense, net, totaled $60.2 million and represents an increase of $2.6 million (4.6%) compared to fiscal 2000. The increase in interest expense resulted from higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower weighted-average interest rates. The increase in the average debt level in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 acquisition of Puritan Medical Products as well as common stock repurchases during fiscal 2001.  As discussed in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and in Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk", the Company manages interest rate exposure of certain borrowings through participation in interest rate swap agreements.  Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables       In December 2000, the Company entered into a trade receivables securitization agreement with two commercial banks.  Net proceeds received by the Company through March 31, 2001 were $73.2 million and were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities.  The discount on the securitization of trade receivables of $1.3 million in fiscal 2001 represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates.  Other Income, net       Other income, net, totaled $242 thousand in fiscal 2001 compared to $17.9 million in fiscal 2000.  Fiscal 2000 includes a $14.9 million gain from the divestitures of operations in Poland and Thailand.  Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates       Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $2.3 million decreased $1.1 million compared to fiscal 2000.  The decrease in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to fourth quarter after-tax charges of $700 thousand related to asset impairments associated with two equity affiliates.  Income Tax Expense       The effective income tax rate was 42.3% of pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2001 compared to 44.8% in 2000.  Excluding the tax effect related to certain gains and special charges in both periods, the effective income tax rate was 41.1% of pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2001 compared to 41.5% in 2000.  Cumulative Effect of an Accounting Change       Fiscal 2000 includes a charge to net earnings of $590 thousand related to the adoption of Statement of Position 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities."  The charge primarily resulted from the write-off of start-up costs capitalized in prior fiscal years in connection with the Company's two air separation units.
18 Net Earnings       Net earnings in fiscal 2001 were $28.2 million, or $.42 per diluted share, compared to $38.3 million, or $.54 per diluted share, in fiscal 2000.
19                     AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES                 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS           OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2000 COMPARED TO 1999  OVERVIEW       The Company's net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000 were $1.54 billion compared to $1.56 billion in the prior year.  Net sales in fiscal 2000 were impacted by continued slowness in certain manufacturing and industrial markets served by the Company.  The Company believes these markets hit a cyclical low in the first quarter of fiscal 2000.  The Company experienced improved same-store sales comparisons in each of the last three quarters of fiscal 2000. In the fiscal fourth quarter, year over year same-store sales improved by 1.8%.  Net earnings for fiscal 2000 were $38.3 million, or $.54 per diluted share, compared to $51.9 million, or $.72 per diluted share, in fiscal 1999.  Net earnings for fiscal years 2000 and 1999 were impacted by special charges, non-recurring divestiture gains and other charges as described below.       Fiscal 2000 includes:       o  special charge recoveries of $2.8 million ($1.7 million after-tax),      o  divestiture gains $17.5 million ($8.6 million after-tax),      o  a litigation charge of $7.5 million ($4.8 million after-tax),      o  an inventory write-down of $3.8 million ($2.2 million after-tax), and      o  an after-tax charge of $590 thousand representing a change in         accounting principle.       Fiscal 1999 includes:       o  special charge recoveries of $1.0 million ($575 thousand after-tax),      o  divestiture gains of $25.5 million ($15 million after-tax), and      o  a $1.8 million after-tax non-recurring gain relating to insurance         proceeds recorded by an equity affiliate.       Excluding the effect of these items, net earnings were $.52 per diluted share in fiscal 2000 and $.48 per diluted share in fiscal 1999.       During fiscal 2000, the Company completed the divestiture of its operations in Poland and Thailand.  Through the date of disposition, the operations in Poland and Thailand had combined sales and operating losses in fiscal 2000 of $12.7 million and $550 thousand, respectively.  The operations in Poland and Thailand were reported in the Gas Operations segment.       During fiscal 2000, the Company acquired six distributors of industrial gas and related equipment with aggregate annual sales of approximately $97 million, including the acquisition of Puritan Medical Products.  Puritan Medical Products, with historical annual sales of approximately $70 million, distributes medical gases through a network of locations in the United States and Canada.       In March 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to seven million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock.  The share repurchase authorization was substantially completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2001.
20 INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY  Net Sales       Net sales decreased 1.2% in fiscal 2000 compared to 1999.
(In thousands)          2000         1999      Increase/(Decrease)                      ----------   ----------   ------------------- Distribution      $1,409,949   $1,406,184   $  3,765     0.3%    Gas Operations       132,385      155,034    (22,649)  (14.6%)                      ----------   ----------   --------                      $1,542,334   $1,561,218   $(18,884)   (1.2%)                      ==========   ==========   ======== For fiscal 2000, Distribution sales increased $3.8 million as a result of net acquisition and divestiture activity of $23.1 million, offset by a same-store sales decline of $19.3 million (-1.7%). Fiscal 2000 sales increased $37.3 million from seventeen distributor acquisitions since April 1, 1998, offset primarily by the divestiture of four businesses.  The decrease in same-store sales resulted from a $32.5 million (-4.2%) decline in hardgoods sales, partially offset by gas and rent same-store sales growth of $13.2 million (1.9%).  Lower sales of hardgoods resulted from general slowness in certain manufacturing and industrial markets served by the Company including: metal fabrication, oil exploration and extraction, agriculture, mining and shipbuilding.  Gas and rent same-store sales growth was primarily attributable to the Company's expansion of its rental welder fleet and improvements in certain gas product sales including bulk, refrigerant and medical gases. The Distribution segment experienced improving same-store sales comparisons in each of the last three quarters of fiscal 2000.  In the fiscal fourth quarter, year over year same-store sales improved by 1.2%.       The Gas Operations segment's sales decreased $22.6 million in fiscal 2000 compared to the prior year as a result of the decrease in sales resulting from the net acquisition and divestiture activity of $27.6 million, partially offset by same-store sales growth of $5.0 million (3.5%).  Sales decreased $35.7 million primarily due to the divestiture of the Company's calcium carbide and carbon operations in December 1998 and the divestiture of operations in Poland and Thailand in August 1999.  The decrease in sales resulting from divestitures was partially offset by the acquisition of four dry ice companies since April 1, 1998, which contributed sales of $8.1 million in fiscal 2000.  Gas Operations' same-store sales growth resulted from higher liquid carbon dioxide, dry ice and nitrous oxide volumes.  Pricing in fiscal 2000 generally remained stable for these products compared to the prior year.  Gross Profits       Gross profits increased 0.4% in fiscal 2000 compared to 1999.
(In thousands)          2000        1999      Increase/(Decrease)                       --------    --------   ------------------- Distribution       $649,827    $637,616     $12,211     1.9%    Gas Operations       75,910      85,547      (9,637)  (11.3%)                       --------    --------     -------                       $725,737    $723,163     $ 2,574     0.4%                       ========    ========     ======= Distribution gross profits increased $12.2 million resulting from acquisitions, which contributed gross profits of $20.9 million, partially offset by divestitures which had gross profits of $7.8 million in the prior year.  Same-store gross profits declined $900 thousand (-0.5%) compared to the prior year.  The decline in same-store gross profits consisted of a decrease in hardgoods gross profits of $10.6 million (-5.0%), partially offset by gas and rent gross profit growth of $9.7 million (1.9%).  The decrease in hardgoods same-store gross profits resulted primarily from lower sales volumes in certain manufacturing and industrial markets.  Same- store gross profits of gas and rent increased as a result of higher gas volumes and increased rent primarily from an expanded rental 21 welder fleet.  The overall Distribution gross profit margin of 46.1% in fiscal 2000 increased 80 basis points from 45.3% in the prior year primarily as a result of a shift in sales mix more heavily weighted towards higher margin gas and rental revenues.  Gas and rent comprised 42.0% of distribution sales in fiscal 2000 compared to 40.5% in fiscal 1999.  Although a competitive hardgoods environment has somewhat increased pricing pressures to the Company's customers, hardgoods margins have been helped by lower product costs resulting from centralized hardgoods purchasing initiatives and sales growth of higher margin private label products.       The decrease in Gas Operations gross profits of $9.6 million resulted from divestitures and an inventory write-down, partially offset by acquisitions and same-store gross profit growth.  Gross profits decreased $13.4 million from divestitures and $3.8 million from an inventory write-down related to certain specialty gases.  The gross profit decline was partially offset by the acquisition of four dry ice businesses that contributed $5.0 million to fiscal 2000 gross profits and by same-store gross profit growth of $2.6 million (2.9%). Gas Operations' gross profit margin, excluding the impact of divestitures, decreased to 57.5% in fiscal 2000 compared to 60.2% in fiscal 1999 primarily due to the inventory write-down and increased sales volume of lower margin liquid carbon dioxide.  Operating Expenses        Operating expenses increased $9.3 million (1.8%) compared to the prior fiscal year primarily from acquisitions with estimated operating expenses of $17 million and a fiscal 2000 fourth quarter litigation charge of $7.5 million, partially offset by divestitures with operating expenses of $11 million in the prior year and the impact of cost reductions initiated during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1999.  The litigation charge represents an estimate of the overall costs associated with the defense and settlement of certain lawsuits related to the Company's hazardous materials fees.  Operating cost reductions related to such areas as headcount and administrative functions helped control operating costs and expenses during fiscal 2000. On a same-store basis, operating expenses decreased approximately $4 million in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999.  Although cost control and reductions resulted in lower operating expenses on a same-store basis in fiscal 2000, the Company experienced higher operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 primarily due to higher salary and wage costs, insurance and fuel costs.  As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses, excluding the fourth quarter litigation charge, increased 50 basis points to 34% compared to fiscal 1999.       Depreciation and amortization totaled $89.3 million in fiscal 2000 representing an increase of $1.4 million (1.6%) compared to fiscal 1999.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of net acquisition and divestiture activity and capital projects completed during the previous 24 months, partially offset by a decrease from a change in depreciable lives of bulk gas storage tanks.  Depreciation and amortization expense relative to sales was 5.8% for the current period compared to 5.6% in the prior year.  Special Charges (Recoveries)       Special charge recoveries in fiscal 2000 primarily consist of recoveries of $2.8 million from an insurance settlement related to a fiscal 1997 loss.  Special charge recoveries in fiscal 1999 include $1 million from adjustments to reflect differences between the original loss estimates and the actual losses related to the divestiture of two non-core businesses during fiscal 1999.
22 Operating Income       Operating income decreased 5.5% in fiscal 2000 compared to 1999. Excluding special (charges) recoveries, operating income decreased 7.2%.

Excluding the litigation charge, the Distribution segment's operating income margin was 7.2% in fiscal 2000.  Gas Operations' operating income margin of 7.0% in fiscal 2000 decreased from 8.7% in fiscal 1999 primarily due to divestitures with higher operating margins and the inventory write-down of certain specialty gases.  Interest Expense       Interest expense, net, totaled $57.6 million and represents a decrease of $2.7 million (-4.5%) compared to fiscal 1999. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower average interest rates. The decrease in the average debt level in fiscal 2000 was primarily due to proceeds from divestitures and the sale-leaseback of certain equipment.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, as a result of increasing market interest rates, the Company experienced higher interest costs.  Other Income, net       Other income, net, totaled $17.8 million in fiscal 2000 compared to $26.7 million in fiscal 1999.  Fiscal 2000 included a $14.9 million gain from the divestitures of operations in Poland and Thailand.  Fiscal 1999 included a $25.5 million gain from the divestiture of the Company's calcium carbide and carbon products operations.  Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates       Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $3.4 million decreased from $7.0 million in fiscal 1999 primarily as a result of a $1.8 million insurance gain recorded by National Welders Supply in fiscal 1999 and lower earnings at both National Welders Supply and the Company's liquid carbon dioxide joint venture.  Income Tax Expense       The effective income tax rate was 44.8% of pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2000 compared to 39.9% in 1999.  Excluding the tax effect related to gains from divestitures and special charges in both periods, the effective income tax rate was 41.5% of pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2000 compared to 39.5% in 1999.  The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily from a decrease in earnings of unconsolidated equity affiliates and income tax from foreign divestitures.
23 Cumulative Effect of an Accounting Change       In fiscal 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Position 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities", resulting in a charge to net earnings of $590 thousand.  The charge primarily resulted from the write-off of start-up costs capitalized in connection with the Company's two air separation units.  Net Earnings       Net earnings in fiscal 2000 were $38.3 million, or $.54 per diluted share, compared to $51.9 million, or $.72 per diluted share, in fiscal 1999.
24 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Cash Flows       Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $199.0 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $100.1 million in fiscal 2000.  Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items, were $125 million in both fiscal 2001 and the prior year.  The fiscal 2001 trade receivables securitization program, described below, provided cash of $73.2 million.  Working capital components provided cash of $7 million compared to a use of cash of $17.6 million in fiscal 2000, representing a net improvement in cash flow of $24.6 million.  Cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities and to fund capital expenditures.       Cash used in investing activities totaled $10.9 million during fiscal 2001.  Investing activities primarily included capital expenditures that used cash of $65.9 million and divestiture proceeds that provided cash of $49.6 million.  Capital expenditures in fiscal 2001 were flat compared to fiscal 2000.  Capital expenditures associated with the purchase of cylinders, bulk tanks, rental welders and machinery and equipment totaled $47.2 million, or 72% of total capital expenditures, and helped facilitate strategic product sales growth.   Fiscal 2001 divestitures primarily consisted of the sale of the Company's Jackson Dome pipeline.  The proceeds from divestitures were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities.       Financing activities used cash of $188.2 million.  Activities that used cash during the period primarily included the net repayment of debt of $183.9 million and the repurchase of the Company's common stock for $11.2 million.  The Company's stock repurchase program was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2001.       Cash on hand at the end of each fiscal year is zero.  On a daily basis depository accounts are swept of all available funds.  The funds are deposited into a concentration account through which all cash on hand is used to repay debt under the Company's revolving credit facilities.       The Company will continue to look for appropriate acquisitions of distributors while it focuses on reducing its financial leverage. Capital expenditures, current debt maturities and any future acquisitions are expected to be funded through the use of cash flow from operations, revolving credit facilities, potential sales of non- core businesses and other financing alternatives, including asset- based financing and subordinated debt facilities.  The Company believes that its sources of financing are adequate for its anticipated needs and that it could arrange additional sources of financing for unanticipated requirements.  The cost and terms of any future financing arrangement depend on the market conditions and the Company's financial position at that time.       The Company does not currently pay dividends.  Financial Instruments       The Company has unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling $665 million and $76.5 million Canadian       (US $49 million) under a credit agreement with a final maturity date of December 5, 2002. The credit agreement contains covenants that include the maintenance of certain financial ratios, restrictions on additional borrowings and limitations on dividends.  At March 31, 2001, the Company had borrowings under the credit agreement of approximately $390 million and $39 million Canadian (US $25 million).  The Company also had commitments under letters of credit supported by the credit agreement of approximately $52 million.  Based on restrictions related to cash flow to funded debt coverage, the Company had additional borrowing capacity under the credit facilities of approximately $189 million at March 31, 2001.  At March 31, 2001, the effective interest rate on borrowings under the credit facilities was 5.79% on U.S. borrowings and 5.17% on Canadian borrowings.  Based on the maturity date related to the revolving credit facilities, the Company anticipates refinancing its credit facilities within the next twelve months. Interest rates of the renegotiated credit facilities will be at prevailing market rates, which may be higher than rates under the Company's existing credit facilities.
25      At March 31, 2001, the Company had the following medium-term notes outstanding:  $50 million of unsecured notes due September 2001 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.15%;  $75 million of unsecured notes due March 2004 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.14%; and $100 million of unsecured notes due September 2006 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.75%.  The medium-term notes due September 2001 are expected to be refinanced with borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities.  Additionally, at March 31, 2001, long- term debt of the Company included acquisition notes and other long- term debt instruments of approximately $54 million with interest rates ranging from 6.0% to 9.0%.  Acquisition notes of $7 million will mature in September 2001 and are expected to be refinanced with borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities.  The Company also has a shelf registration with a capacity of approximately $175 million for the issuance of debt and other types of securities.       The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates.  At March 31, 2001, the Company was party to 17 interest rate swap agreements.  The swap agreements are with major financial institutions and aggregate $477 million in notional principal amount at March 31, 2001.  Thirteen swap agreements with approximately $347 million in notional principal amount require fixed interest payments based on an average effective rate of 6.33% for remaining periods ranging between one and four years.  Four swap agreements with $130 million in notional principal amount require variable interest payments based on an average rate of 5.51% at March 31, 2001.  Under the terms of one swap agreement, the Company has elected to receive the discounted value of the counterparties' interest payments up-front.  At March 31, 2001, approximately $1.0 million of such payments were included in other current liabilities and $400 thousand of such payments were included in other non-current liabilities.  The Company monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties, and does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties.  After considering the effect of interest rate swap agreements, the Company's ratio of fixed to variable interest rates was 60% to 40%.  Trade Receivables Securitization       In December 2000, the Company entered into a $150 million three- year trade receivables securitization agreement with two commercial banks.  The revolving period securitization helps diversify the Company's funding sources at an efficient all-in cost of funds. During fiscal 2001, the Company sold $284.9 million of trade receivables and remitted to the bank conduits, pursuant to a servicing agreement, $211.7 million in collections on those receivables.  Net proceeds from the securitization were $73.2 million, which were used to repay borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities.  In April 2001, the Company completed the second and final tranche of the $150 million trade receivables securitization program.  Proceeds from the second tranche of $64.3 million were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities.       The transaction has been accounted for as a sale under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities."  Under the agreement, eligible trade receivables are sold to bank conduits through a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity, which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.  The difference between the proceeds from the sale and the carrying value of the receivables is recognized as "Discount on securitization of trade receivables" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings under Item 8. and varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates.  The Company retains a subordinated interest in the receivables sold, which is recorded at the receivables' previous carrying value.  In accordance with a servicing agreement, the Company will continue to service, administer and collect the trade receivables on behalf of the bank conduits. The servicing fees charged to the bank conduits approximate the costs of collections, which approximates fair value.
26 Operating Lease with Trust       In fiscal 2000, the Company renewed a lease of real estate with a trust established by a commercial bank.  The lease was amended to include the sale-leaseback of certain equipment. The trust holds title to the properties and equipment included in the leases.  The rental payments are based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin and the cost of the property acquired by the trust.  At March 31, 2001, the non-cancelable lease obligation of the real estate and equipment lease was $44 million, a $2 million reduction compared to the prior year.  The lease has a five-year term and has been accounted for as an operating lease.  The Company has guaranteed a residual value of the real estate and the equipment at the end of the lease term of approximately $30 million.  A gain of approximately $12 million on the equipment portion of the transaction has been deferred until the expiration of the Company's guarantee of the residual value.  Employee Benefits Trust       In fiscal 1999, the Company established a grantor trust (the "Trust") to fund certain future obligations of the Company's employee benefit and compensation plans.  The Company, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, may sell shares of common stock to the Trust.  Such common stock consists of shares the Company has purchased or will purchase on the open market or in private transactions.  The common stock may also consist of shares issued directly to the Trust.  During fiscal 2001, the Trust purchased approximately 2 million shares of common stock, previously held as treasury stock, from the Company, for $11.3 million (based on the average market closing price for the five days preceding each transaction).  The Company holds promissory notes from the Trust in the amount of each purchase.  Shares held by the Trust serve as collateral for the promissory notes and are available to fund certain employee benefit plan obligations as the promissory notes are repaid. The shares held by the Trust are not considered outstanding for earnings per share purposes until they are released from serving as collateral for the promissory notes.  Approximately 1.2 million shares were issued from the Trust during fiscal 2001 for employee benefit programs.  An independent third-party financial institution serves as the Trustee. The Trustee votes or tenders shares held by the Trust in accordance with instructions received from the participants in the employee benefit and compensation plans funded by the Trust.  Inflation       While the U.S. inflation rate has been relatively modest for several years, rising costs continue to affect the Company's business.  The Company strives to minimize the effects of inflation through cost containment and price increases under highly competitive conditions.  OTHER  New Accounting Pronouncements       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133").  This statement standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that an entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure them at fair value.  SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 138, is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.  Management has evaluated the impact of SFAS 133, as amended, in connection with the Company's use of derivatives in managing interest rate risk.  The Company's exposure to derivatives is limited to interest rate swap agreements, which are highly effective in managing the Company's interest rate exposure.  A high correlation exists between the terms of the interest rate swaps and the underlying debt obligations of the Company.  As such, fluctuations in the fair value of the swaps are offset by an equal and opposite fluctuation in the carrying value of the underlying debt obligations.  Consequently, the implementation of SFAS 133, as amended, is not expected to have a material impact on the net earnings of the Company.

28 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Interest Rate Risk       The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates.  The interest rate exposure arises primarily from the interest payment terms of the Company's borrowing agreements.  Interest rate swap agreements are used to adjust the interest rate risk exposures that are inherent in its portfolio of funding sources.  The Company has not, and will not establish any interest risk positions for purposes other than managing the risk associated with its portfolio of funding sources.  The Company maintains the ratio of fixed to variable rate debt within parameters established by management under policies approved by the Board of Directors.  After the effect of interest rate swap agreements, the ratio of fixed to variable rate debt was 60% to 40% at March 31, 2001.  Counterparties to interest rate swap agreements are major financial institutions.  The Company has established counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions with long-term credit ratings of `A' or better.  In addition, the Company monitors its position and the credit ratings of its counterparties, thereby minimizing the risk of non-performance by the counterparties.       The table below summarizes the Company's market risks associated with long-term debt obligations, interest rate swaps and LIBOR-based agreements as of March 31, 2001.  For long-term debt obligations, the table presents cash flows related to payments of principal and interest by fiscal year of maturity.  For interest rate swaps and LIBOR-based agreements, the table presents the notional amounts underlying the agreements by year of maturity.  The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual payments to be exchanged and are not actually paid or received.  Fair values were computed using market quotes, if available, or based on discounted cash flows using market interest rates as of the end of the period.

For future periods, the variable interest rate is assumed to remain at 5.75% with the principal balance of long-term debt obligations held constant at $415 million.  However, the variable rate and borrowing levels of long-term debt may fluctuate materially from those presented above.  (b)  The variable receive rate for Canadian dollar denominated interest rate swaps is the rate on Canadian Bankers' acceptances ("CAD BA").  (c)  The operating lease terminates October 8, 2004, but may be renewed subject to provisions of the lease agreement.  (d)  The three-year agreement expires on December 19, 2003, but the initial term is subject to renewal provisions of the trade receivables securitization agreement.
30 Limitations of the tabular presentation       As the table incorporates only those interest rate risk exposures that exist as of March 31, 2001, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.  In addition, actual cash flows of financial instruments in future periods may differ materially from prospective cash flows presented in the table due to future fluctuations in variable interest rates and Company debt levels.  Foreign Currency Rate Risk       Canadian subsidiaries of the Company are funded in part with local currency debt.  The Company does not otherwise hedge its exposure to translation gains and losses relating to foreign currency net asset exposures. The Company considers its exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations to be immaterial to its consolidated financial position and results of operations.

F-2                     INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT   The Board of Directors Airgas, Inc.:       We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Airgas, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) listed in the accompanying index. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index.  These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.       We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.       In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Airgas, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.                                            /s/ KPMG LLP  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania May 8, 2001 F-3           STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY       Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the consolidated financial statements and related financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The financial statements reflect management's informed judgment and estimation as to the effect of events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed.       Management maintains a system of internal control at each business unit.  This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and records properly reflect transactions executed in accordance with management's authorization. The Company also maintains a staff of internal auditors who review and evaluate the system of internal control.  In determining the extent of the system of internal control, management recognizes that the cost should not exceed the benefits derived.  The evaluation of these factors requires estimates and judgment by management.       The Company's financial statements have been audited by KPMG LLP, independent auditors.  Their Independent Auditors' Report, which is based on an audit made in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, is presented on the previous page.  In performing their audit, KPMG LLP considers the Company's internal control structure to the extent they deem necessary in order to plan their audit, determine the nature, timing and extent of tests to be performed and issue their report on the consolidated financial statements.       The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets with the independent auditors, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself that they are properly discharging their responsibilities. The auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee.  Airgas, Inc.  /s/ Roger F.

F-8                             AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (a) Basis of Presentation       The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Airgas, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company"). Unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for on the equity method and generally consist of 20-50% owned operations where control does not exist or is considered temporary.  The excess of the cost of these affiliates over the Company's share of their net assets at the acquisition date is being amortized primarily over 40 years.  Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.       The Company has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  (b) Inventories       Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for approximately 88% and 86% of the inventories at March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  Cost for the remainder of inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.  (c) Plant and Equipment       Plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets.  (d) Goodwill       Goodwill represents costs in excess of net assets of businesses acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected periods to be benefited, which is principally 40 years.  The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill by determining whether the amortization of the goodwill balance over its remaining life can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows.       In making such determination with respect to goodwill, the Company evaluates the performance of underlying businesses that give rise to such assets.  The assets acquired in connection with these acquisitions continue to generate a significant portion of the Company's net sales, total operating income and cash flow.  (e) Other Intangible Assets       Costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt.  Costs and payments pursuant to non-competition arrangements entered into in connection with business acquisitions are amortized over the terms of the arrangements, which are principally over five years.  The Company assesses the recoverability of non-competition arrangements by determining whether the amortization of the asset balance can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows of the related business over its remaining life.
F-9                            AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (Continued)  (f) Commitments and Contingencies       The Company's policy is to accrue future legal fees associated with outstanding litigation.  Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the claim, assessment or damages can be reasonably estimated.  (g) Income Taxes       Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.  (h) Foreign Currency Translation       The functional currency of the Company's foreign operations is the applicable local currency.  The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using average exchange rates during each reporting period.  The gains or losses, net of applicable deferred income taxes, resulting from such translations are included in stockholders' equity as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss."  Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as incurred.  (i) Concentrations of Credit Risk       Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables.  Concentrations of credit risk are limited due to the Company's large number of customers and their dispersion across many industries throughout North America.  Credit terms granted to customers are generally net 30 days.  (j) Financial Instruments       In managing interest rate risk exposure, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements.  An interest rate swap is a contractual exchange of interest payments between two parties. A standard interest rate swap involves the payment of a fixed rate times a notional amount by one party in exchange for a floating rate times the same notional amount from another party.  As interest rates change, the difference to be paid or received is accrued and recognized as interest expense over the life of the agreement.  These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes and the Company has the ability and intent to hold these instruments to maturity. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is not recognized in the financial statements.  Counterparties to the Company's interest rate swap agreements are major financial institutions.       The carrying amounts for trade receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
F-10                            AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (Continued)  (k) Employee Benefits Trust       The Company established a grantor trust (the "Trust") to fund future obligations of the Company's employee benefit and compensation plans.  Shares are purchased by the Trust from the Company at fair market value and are reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets under the caption "Employee benefits trust."  Shares are transferred from the Trust to fund compensation and employee benefit obligations based on the original cost of the shares to the Trust. The satisfaction of compensation and employee benefit plan obligations is based on the fair value of shares transferred.  Differences between the original cost of the shares to the Trust and the fair market value of shares transferred is charged or credited to capital in excess of par value.  (l) Revenue Recognition       Revenue from sales of gas and hardgoods products is recognized when products are delivered to customers. Rental fees on cylinders, bulk gas storage tanks and other equipment are recognized when earned.  Under long-term lease agreements in which rental fees are collected in advance, revenues are deferred and recognized over the terms of the lease agreements.  (m) Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs       The Company recognizes delivery and freight charges to customers as elements of net sales.  Costs of third party freight are recognized as cost of sales while costs of deliveries by company vehicles and personnel are recognized as elements of selling, distribution and administrative expenses and depreciation expense.  (n) Accounting and Disclosure Changes       The Company adopted the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101"), as required, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.  SAB 101 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements.  The adoption of SAB 101 did not result in a change to the Company's method of revenue recognition.       The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities" ("SFAS 140"), as required, in fiscal 2001.  SFAS 140 replaces SFAS 125, revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets, and requires certain additional disclosures.  The adoption of SFAS 140 did not have an impact on the results of operations, financial position and liquidity of the Company.       The Company adopted Statement of Position 98-5 "Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities" ("SOP 98-5"), as required, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2000 resulting in a charge to net earnings of $590 thousand.  In accordance with SOP 98-5, the charge has been reflected on a separate line entitled "Cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of taxes," on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  The charge primarily resulted from the write-off of start- up costs capitalized in connection with the Company's two air separation units.

The purchase price for the remaining 3 businesses amounted to approximately $4 million.       1999  - During fiscal 1999, the Company purchased 15 businesses. The largest of these acquisitions and their effective dates included Abel Carbonic Products, Inc. (May 1, 1998), Gas House Welding Supply, Inc. (July 1, 1998), Carbonic Products, Inc.

At March 31, 2000, accrued liabilities related to the 1998 Special Charges were $3.8 million.  During fiscal 2001, the Company completed the sale of its equity investments in India, which were the final divestitures contemplated under the 1998 Special Charges.  After completing the activities contemplated by the repositioning plan, the remaining accrued liabilities were reversed with the adjustment reflected in income as special charge recoveries.   (4) EARNINGS PER SHARE       Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding during the period.  Outstanding shares consist of issued shares less treasury stock and common stock held by the Employee Benefits Trust.  Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average common shares outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents related to stock options and contingently issuable shares.       The table below reconciles basic weighted average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the three years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999: Years Ended March 31,                                               ------------------------ (In thousands)                                2001      2000      1999                                               ----      ----      ---- Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic...................................... 66,000    69,200    70,000    Stock options...........................    600     1,000     1,400    Contingently issuable shares............    600       400       300                                             ------    ------    ------ Diluted.................................... 67,200    70,600    71,700                                             ======    ======    ====== Contingently issuable shares represent the required issuance of Company common stock in connection with a prior year acquisition. During fiscal 2001, the Company issued approximately 800 thousand shares in connection with the acquisition.  The number of issuable shares was determined based on the spread between the average closing market value of the Company's common stock for the ten business days ended October 1, 2000 ($6.09 per share) and $13.10 per share.  The contingent shares included in the diluted weighted average shares calculation have been weighted based on the number of contingent shares issuable as of the end of each quarter during the fiscal years presented.  Additional common stock issued in connection with the prior year acquisition reduced capital in excess of par value and increased common stock for the par value of the additional shares issued.

The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for trade receivables and payables, accrued liabilities, accrued income taxes, and short-term borrowings approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.  Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the table below.

The revolving period securitization helps diversify the Company's funding sources at an efficient all-in cost of funds. During fiscal 2001, the Company sold $284.9 million of trade receivables and remitted to the bank conduits, pursuant to a servicing agreement, $211.7 million in collections on those receivables.  Net proceeds from the securitization were $73.2 million, which were used to repay borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities.

AND SUBSIDIARIES                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (11)   TRADE RECEIVABLES SECURITIZATION - (Continued)       The transaction has been accounted for as a sale under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities."  Under the agreement, eligible trade receivables are sold to bank conduits through a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity, which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.  The difference between the proceeds from the sale and the carrying value of the receivables is recognized as "Discount on securitization of trade receivables" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings and varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates.  The Company retains a subordinated interest in the receivables sold, which is recorded at the receivables' previous carrying value.  A subordinated retained interest of approximately $26 million at March 31, 2001 is included in "Trade receivables" in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.  In accordance with a servicing agreement, the Company will continue to service, administer and collect the trade receivables on behalf of the bank conduits. The servicing fees charged to the bank conduits approximate the costs of collections.  The Company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts on trade receivables that it retains.       In April 2001, the Company completed the second and final tranche of the $150 million trade receivables securitization program. Proceeds from the second tranche of $64.3 million were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities.  The three-year trade receivables securitization agreement expires on December 19, 2003, but the initial term is subject to renewal provisions.   (12) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  (a)  Common Stock       The Company is authorized to issue up to 200 million shares of common stock with a par value of $.01 per share.  At March 31, 2001, the number of shares of common stock outstanding was 68,144,341, excluding 516 thousand shares of common stock held as treasury stock and 5.7 million shares of common stock held in a grantor trust as described under Note 12(d).  (b)  Preferred Stock and Redeemable Preferred Stock       The Company is authorized to issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock.  Of the 20 million shares authorized, 200 thousand shares have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and 200 thousand shares have been designated as Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock (see Note 12(e) for further discussion).  At March 31, 2001 and 2000, no shares of the preferred stock were issued or outstanding.  The preferred stock may be issued from time to time by the Company's Board of Directors in one or more series.  The Board of Directors is authorized to fix the dividend rights and terms, conversion rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, liquidation preferences, and any other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any series of preferred stock, and the number of shares constituting each such series and designation thereof.       Additionally, the Company is authorized to issue 30 thousand shares of redeemable preferred stock. At March 31, 2001 and 2000, no shares were issued or outstanding.
F-20                            AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (12) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY - (Continued)  (c)  Treasury Stock       In March 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to seven million shares, or approximately 10%, of the Company's outstanding common stock.  The authorization provided for the repurchase of shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions and other factors.  In accordance with the March 1999 and previous share repurchase authorizations, the Company acquired 1.4 million, 5.3 million, and 1.4 million shares of common stock in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  In fiscal 2001, the Company reissued 2 million shares of common stock to the Company's Employee Benefits Trust (the "Trust"), as discussed in Note 12(d).  In fiscal 2000, the Company reissued 4.2 million shares of common stock to the Trust and 48 thousand shares for stock option exercises.  In fiscal 1999, the Company reissued 826 thousand shares of common stock to the Trust and 598 thousand for stock option exercises.  When treasury shares are reissued, the Company uses an average cost method with the excess of the repurchase cost over the reissuance price accounted for as a charge to capital in excess of par value.  During fiscal 2001, the Company completed the stock repurchase program.  (d)  Shares in Employee Benefits Trust       In March 1999, the Company established a grantor trust (the "Trust") to fund certain future obligations of the Company's employee benefit and compensation plans.  The Company, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, may sell shares of common stock to the Trust.  Such common stock consists of shares the Company has purchased or will purchase on the open market or in private transactions.  The common stock may also consist of shares issued directly to the Trust.  The Company holds promissory notes from the Trust in the amount of each purchase.  Shares held by the Trust serve as collateral for the promissory notes and are available to fund employee benefit plan obligations as the promissory notes are repaid. The shares held by the Trust are not considered outstanding for earnings per share purposes until they are released from serving as collateral for the promissory notes.  An independent third-party financial institution serves as the Trustee.  The Trustee votes or tenders shares held by the Trust in accordance with instructions received from the participants in the employee benefit and compensation plans to be funded by the Trust.  In fiscal 2001 and 2000, the Trust purchased 2 million and 4.2 million shares of common stock, previously held as treasury stock, from the Company, for approximately $11 million and $35 million, respectively. Approximately 1.2 million and 230 thousand shares were issued from the Trust for employee benefit programs during fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively.  (e)  Stockholder Rights Plan       Effective April 1, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a new stockholder rights plan (the "1997 Rights Plan"). Pursuant to the 1997 Rights Plan, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right for each share of common stock. Each right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one one- thousandth of a share Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an initial exercise price of $100 per share.       Rights become exercisable only following the acquisition by a person or group of 15 percent (or 20 percent in the case of the Chairman and certain of his affiliates) or more of the Company's common stock or after the announcement of a tender offer or exchange offer to acquire 15 percent (or 20 percent in the case of the Chairman and certain of his affiliates) or more of the outstanding common stock.  If such a person or group acquires 15 percent or more (or 20 percent or more, as the case may be) of the common stock, each right (other than such person's or group's rights, which will become void) will entitle the holder to purchase, at the exercise price, common stock having a market value equal to twice the exercise price. In certain circumstances, the rights may be redeemed by the Company. If not redeemed, they will expire on April 1, 2007.
F-21                            AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (13)  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION       The Company has elected to continue to account for its stock- based compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."  Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its stock option plans and its stock purchase plan.  However, pro forma information regarding net earnings and earnings per share is required.  Had compensation expense for the Company's stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant date, the Company's pro forma net earnings and earnings per share for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 would be as follows: Years Ended March 31,                                           ---------------------- (In thousands, except per share amounts)  2001     2000     1999                                           ----     ----     ---- Net earnings      As reported...........  $28,223  $38,283  $51,924                   Pro forma.............  $22,142  $32,602  $46,636  Diluted earnings  As reported...........  $   .42  $   .54  $   .72 per share         Pro forma.............  $   .33  $   .46  $   .65 The pro forma impact only takes into account options granted since April 1, 1995 and is likely to have a greater impact in future years as additional options are granted and amortized ratably over the vesting period.  The Company's stock-based compensation plans are described below.  (a) Employee Stock Option Plans       The Company has a stock plan under which officers and key employees may be granted options.  In May 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Plan").  Options under the 1997 Plan vest 25% annually and have a maximum term of ten years.  Under the 1997 Plan, at March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, 3.7 million, 5.4 million and 6.3 million options, respectively, were available for issuance.  In fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, 1.7 million, 1.1 million and 1.7 million options, respectively, were granted with an exercise price equal to market price at the date of grant.  Options under the 1997 Plan are generally granted in May of each year.       The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 option grants, respectively:  expected volatility of 51.1%, 44.2% and 42.6%, risk-free interest rate of 6.5%, 5.6% and 5.5%, and expected life of 5.6, 4.9 and 4.8 years.  The weighted average fair value of the options granted during fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $3.13, $5.19 and $5.82, respectively.

(b) Board of Directors Stock Option Plans       The Company also maintains stock option plans covering directors who are not employees.  In May 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Directors' Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Directors' Plan").  The 1997 Directors' Plan reserved 500 thousand shares for issuance.  Options under the 1997 Directors' Plan are exercisable in full on the date of grant.       Under the 1997 Directors' Plan, at March 31, 2001, 253,500 options were available for issuance.  During fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, 100,000, 62,500 and 48,000 options, respectively, were granted with an exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten years.       The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 option grants, respectively: expected volatility of 51.1%, 44.8% and 42.2%, risk-free interest rate of 6.1%, 5.8% and 5.5%, and expected life of 5.6, 5.4 and 5.5 years.  The weighted average fair value of the stock options granted during fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $2.85, $6.01 and $6.36, respectively.

The 1998 Plan replaced the previous 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The 1998 Plan is authorized to issue up to 3 million shares of common stock.  Effective January 1, 1999, eligible employees may elect to have up to 15% of their annual gross earnings withheld to purchase common stock at 85% of the market value.  Market value under the 1998 Plan is defined as either the closing share price on the New York Stock Exchange as of the employees' enrollment date or the closing price on the last business day of a fiscal quarter, whichever is lower.  An employee may lock-in a purchase price for up to 27 months. The 1998 Plan is designed to comply with the requirements of Sections 421 and 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.  During fiscal 2001, the Company issued 1.2 million shares, provided from the Employee Benefits Trust, to fund purchases made by employees under the 1998 Plan at an average purchase price of $4.86 per share.  During fiscal 2000, the Company issued 806 thousand shares from the Employee Benefits Trust and treasury stock for the 1998 Plan at an average purchase price of $7.09 per share.       The 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "1994 Plan") was authorized to issue up to 2 million shares of common stock at terms generally consistent with the 1998 Plan. The Company issued 614 thousand shares under the 1994 Plan at an average purchase price of $9.30 during fiscal 1999.  During fiscal 2000, the Company terminated the 1994 Plan.       Compensation expense under SFAS 123 is estimated for the fair value of the employees' option to purchase shares of common stock, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively: expected volatility of 63%, 51%, and 46% risk-free interest rate of 5.4%, 6.0%, and 4.8%, and expected term of 27 months for each period.  The weighted average fair value of the purchase options granted in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $3.47, $3.94 and $4.79, respectively.
F-25                            AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (14) INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES       The Company's investments in unconsolidated affiliates totaled approximately $63 million at March 31, 2001, and $73 million at March 31, 2000.  The Company's investments include a 47% joint venture interest in the voting capital stock of National Welders Supply Company, Inc. ("National Welders").  National Welders is a distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases and related equipment based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The investment in National Welders totaled approximately $55 million at March 31, 2001 and 2000.  The Company's other investments in unconsolidated affiliates totaled approximately $8 million at March 31, 2001 and approximately $18 million at March 31, 2000.  The decrease compared to March 31, 2000 primarily relates to the fiscal 2001 divestiture of the Company's investments in India, as described in Note 2(b).  At March 31, 2001, the Company's other investments primarily consist of a 50% joint venture interest in AC Industries.       On December 31, 1998, the Company divested its calcium carbide and carbon products manufacturing operations to Elkem Metals Company L.P. ("Elkem"), a subsidiary of Elkem ASA.  In conjunction with the sale, the Company terminated its 55% interest in a joint venture, which marketed calcium carbide throughout the United States.       The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated affiliates by the equity method of accounting.  The Company's share of earnings from all unconsolidated affiliates was $2.3 million, $3.4 million, and $7.9 million for the years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Equity in earnings from Elkem of $900 thousand in 1999 is included in Gas Operations' net sales.  The investments in unconsolidated affiliates include goodwill of approximately $28 million and $29 million as of March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, which is primarily being amortized to earnings over 40 years.

This benefit has been recorded in capital in excess of par value.       In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.  Management considers the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.  Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances, at March 31, 2001.  Valuation allowances primarily relate to state tax net operating loss carry forwards.
F-29                            AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (17) BENEFIT PLANS       The Company has a defined contribution 401(k) plan (the "plan") covering substantially all full-time employees. Under the terms of the plan, the Company makes matching contributions up to two percent of participants' wages plus additional discretionary profit sharing contributions based upon the profitability of the Company.  Amounts expensed under the plan for fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999 were $5.8 million, $5.9 million and $4.7 million, respectively.       Certain subsidiaries of the Company participate in multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans which provide defined benefits to union employees.  Contributions are made to the plans in accordance with negotiated labor contracts.  The Company has not taken any action to terminate or withdraw from these plans. Management believes that the Company's liability, if any, for multi-employer plan withdrawal liability will not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  Amounts expensed under the pension plans for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $543 thousand, $526 thousand and $611 thousand, respectively.    (18) RELATED PARTIES       During the years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, National Welders, an unconsolidated equity affiliate, paid $3.8 million, $3.5 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, to the Company for gas products, hardgoods and services.  In addition, National Welders sold gas products and hardgoods to the Company in the amounts of $787 thousand, $330 thousand, and $552 thousand in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.       The Company paid $7.9 million, $9.1 million, and $8.4 million to AC Industries, an unconsolidated equity affiliate, for the purchase of liquid carbon dioxide during the years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  In addition, the Company had a net payable balance to AC Industries totaling $1.2 million, $695 thousand, and $1.3 million, at March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.   (19) LEASES       The Company leases certain distribution facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases with varying terms.  Most leases contain renewal options and in some instances, purchase options. Rentals under these long-term leases for the years ended March 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, amounted to $43.7 million, $38.5 million, and $35.4 million, respectively.  Certain operating facilities are leased at market rates from employees of the Company who were previous owners of businesses acquired.  The Company also has several capital leases assumed as part of prior acquisitions.  Outstanding lease obligations and the related capital assets are not material to the consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2001 and 2000.       In fiscal 2000, the Company renewed a lease of real estate with a trust established by a commercial bank.  The lease was amended to include the sale-leaseback of certain equipment. The trust holds title to the properties and equipment included in the leases.  The rental payments are based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin and the cost of the property acquired by the trust.  At March 31, 2001, the non-cancelable lease obligation of the real estate and equipment lease totaled approximately $44 million.  The lease has a five-year term and has been accounted for as an operating lease.  The Company has guaranteed a residual value of the real estate and the equipment at the end of the lease term of approximately $30 million.  A gain of approximately $12 million on the equipment portion of the transaction has been deferred until the expiration of the Company's guarantee of the residual value.

("Praxair") filed suit against the Company in the Circuit Court of Mobile County, Alabama.  The complaint alleged tortious interference with business or contractual relations with respect to Praxair's Right of First Refusal contract with the majority shareholders of National Welders Supply Company, Inc. ("National Welders") in connection with the Company's formation of a joint venture with National Welders.  In June 1998, Praxair filed a motion to dismiss its own action in Alabama and commenced another action in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, alleging substantially the same tortious interference by the Company.  The North Carolina action also alleges breach of contract against National Welders and certain shareholders of National Welders and unfair trade practices and conspiracy against all the defendants.  In the North Carolina action, Praxair seeks compensatory damages in excess of $10 thousand, punitive damages and other unspecified relief.  The Company anticipates that additional discovery and pretrial motions will be completed by the end of the calendar year, and that a trial on the merits will begin in April 2002. The Company believes that Praxair's North Carolina claims are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against such claims. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $6.9 million for the anticipated costs of defending the Praxair lawsuit.       In 1997, the Company announced it was the victim of a fraudulent breach of contract by a third party supplier of refrigerant gases and recorded a special charge related to product losses and costs associated with the Company's efforts to investigate the fraud and pursue recoveries.  In March 2001, the Company reached a final settlement with its insurance carriers resulting in additional insurance recoveries of $4 million.  The insurance settlement net of associated legal expenses was reflected in special charge recoveries in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.       In fiscal 2000, the Company recorded a $7.5 million charge representing an estimate of the overall costs associated with the defense and settlement of certain class action lawsuits pertaining to hazardous material charges paid to the Company by customers.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, a settlement agreement and approving court orders covering all such class actions against the Company became final, and the Company reversed $1.1 million of the previously accrued defense and settlement costs.       The Company is involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of its business and have not been fully adjudicated.  These actions, when ultimately concluded and determined, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect upon the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

AND SUBSIDIARIES                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (20) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - (Continued)   (b)  Insurance Coverage       The Company has established insurance programs to cover workers' compensation, business automobile, general and products liability. These programs have self-insured retention of $500 thousand per occurrence.  Estimated losses are accrued based upon the Company's experience for the aggregate liability for claims incurred and claims incurred but not reported.  The Company believes its insurance reserves are adequate.       The nature of the Company's business may subject it to product and general liability lawsuits.  To the extent that the Company is subject to claims that exceed its liability insurance coverage of $100 million, such suits could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

AND SUBSIDIARIES                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (22) SUMMARY BY BUSINESS SEGMENT       The Company aggregates its operations, based on products and services, into two reportable segments, Distribution and Gas Operations.  The Distribution segment accounts for approximately 90% of consolidated sales.  The segment's principal products and services are packaged and small bulk gases, gas cylinder and welding equipment rental and hardgoods.  Gas sales include industrial, medical and specialty gases such as: nitrogen, oxygen, argon, helium, acetylene, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, hydrogen, welding gases, ultra high purity grades and special application blends.  Rent is derived from gas cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk storage tanks and through the rental of welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding supplies and equipment, safety products, and industrial tools and supplies.       The Gas Operations segment produces and distributes certain gas products, principally dry ice, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and specialty gases.   The Company also operates two air separation plants that produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon which are sold to on- site customers and to the Distribution segment.  Until their divestiture in fiscal 2000, the segment also reflected the Company's operations in Poland and Thailand.  Additionally, until its divestiture in fiscal 1999, the segment reflected the manufacture and sale of calcium carbide and carbon products.       The Company's operations are principally in the United States. The Company's customer base is diverse and sales are not dependent on a single or small group of customers.       The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Note 1). Additionally, Corporate operating results are allocated to each segment pro rata based on sales dollars; Corporate assets have been allocated to the Distribution segment; intercompany sales are recorded on the same basis as sales to third parties; and intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods segment disclosures to conform to the current presentation.
