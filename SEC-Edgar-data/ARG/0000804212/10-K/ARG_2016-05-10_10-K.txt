BUSINESS.
GENERAL Airgas, Inc. and subsidiaries (Airgas or the Company) became a publicly traded company in 1986 and, through its subsidiaries, is the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases (delivered in packaged or cylinder form), and hardgoods, such as welding equipment and supplies. Airgas is also one of the largest U.S. distributors of safety products, the largest U.S. producer of nitrous oxide and dry ice, the largest liquid carbon dioxide producer in the Southeast, the fifth largest producer of atmospheric merchant gases in North America, and a leading distributor of process chemicals, refrigerants and ammonia products. The Company markets these products to its diversified customer base through multiple sales channels including branch-based sales representatives, retail stores, strategic customer account programs, telesales, catalogs, eBusiness and independent distributors. Products reach customers through an integrated network of more than 14,000 employees and approximately 1,100 locations including branches, retail stores, gas fill plants, specialty gas labs, production facilities and distribution centers. The Companys national scale and strong local presence offer a competitive edge to its diversified customer base.
The Companys consolidated sales were $4.25 billion, $3.88 billion and $4.36 billion in the fiscal years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Companys operations are predominantly in the United States. However, the Company does conduct operations outside of the United States, principally in Canada and, to a lesser extent, Mexico, Russia, Dubai and Europe. Revenues derived from foreign countries, based on the point of sale, were $75 million, $77 million and $86 million in the fiscal years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Long-lived assets attributable to the Companys foreign operations represent less than 4.0% of the consolidated total long-lived assets of the Company and were $142 million, $141 million and $116 million at March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Since its inception, the Company has made approximately 400 acquisitions. During fiscal 2011, the Company acquired eight businesses with aggregate historical annual sales of more than $21 million. The largest of these businesses was Conley Gas, Ltd., a supplier of pure gases to the specialty gas industry. The La Porte, Texas-based business purifies, repackages and distributes high-purity hydrocarbons such as methane and ethylene. The Company acquired these eight businesses in order to expand its geographic coverage and strengthen its national network of branch-store locations. The Company paid a total of $21.2 million in cash to acquire these businesses and settle holdback liabilities and contingent consideration arrangements associated with certain prior year acquisitions. See Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for a description of current and prior year acquisition activity.
The Company has two reporting segments, Distribution and All Other Operations. The Distribution business segment primarily engages in the distribution of industrial, medical and specialty gases and hardgoods, and in the production of gases to supply the regional distribution companies. The All Other Operations business segment consists of six business units which primarily manufacture and/or distribute carbon dioxide, dry ice, nitrous oxide, ammonia and refrigerant gases. Financial information by business segment can be found in Item7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), and in Note 21 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A more detailed description of the Companys business segments follows.
DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS SEGMENT The Distribution business segment accounted for approximately 90% of consolidated sales in each of the fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009.
Principal Products and Services The Distribution business segments principal products include industrial, medical and specialty gases sold in packaged and bulk quantities, as well as hardgoods. The Companys air separation facilities and national specialty gas labs primarily produce gases that are sold by the Distribution business segments business units. Gas sales include nitrogen, oxygen, argon, helium, hydrogen, welding and fuel gases such as acetylene, propylene and propane, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, ultra high purity grades, special application blends and process chemicals. Business units in the Distribution business segment also recognize rental revenue, derived from gas cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk storage tanks, tube trailers and welding and welding related equipment. Gas and rent represented 60%, 61% and 57% of the Distribution business segments sales in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Hardgoods consist of welding consumables and equipment, safety products, construction supplies, and maintenance, repair and operating supplies. Hardgoods sales represented 40%, 39% and 43% of the Distribution business segments sales in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
4 Table of Contents Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution The industry has three principal modes of gas distribution: on-site or pipeline supply, bulk or merchant supply, and cylinder or packaged supply. Airgas market focus has primarily been on packaged gas distribution supplying customers with product in gaseous form in cylinders, in liquid form in dewars, and in less-than-truckload liquid bulk quantities. Generally, packaged gas distributors also sell welding hardgoods. The Company believes the U.S. market for packaged gases and welding hardgoods to have been approximately $13 billion in annual revenue during its fiscal 2011. Packaged gases and welding hardgoods are generally delivered to customers on Company-owned or leased trucks, although third-party carriers are also used in the delivery of welding and safety products, and customers can purchase products at retail branch stores and through catalogs and eBusiness.
Airgas is the largest distributor of packaged gases and welding hardgoods in the United States, with an estimated 25% market share. The Companys competitors in this market include local and regional independent distributors that account for about half of the markets annual revenues, and vertically integrated gas producers, which account for the remainder of the market. Packaged gas distribution is a localized business because it is generally not economical to transport gas cylinders more than 50 to 100 miles. The localized nature of the business makes these markets highly competitive and competition is generally based on reliable product delivery, product availability, technical support, quality and price.
Customer Base The Companys operations are predominantly in the United States. The Companys customer base is diverse and sales are not dependent on a single or small group of customers. The Companys largest customer accounts for approximately 0.5% of total net sales. The Company estimates the following industry segments account for the indicated percentages of its total fiscal 2011 net sales:  Repair& Maintenance (29%)  Industrial Manufacturing (26%)  Energy and Infrastructure Construction (10%)  Medical (9%)  Petrochemical (7%)  Food and Beverage (6%)  Retail and Wholesale (3%)  Analytical (2%)  Utilities (3%)  Transportation (2%)  Other (3%).
Supply The Companys atmospheric gas production capacity includes 15 air separation plants that produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon, making Airgas the fifth largest producer of atmospheric gases in North America. In addition, the Company purchases atmospheric and other gases pursuant to contracts with national and regional producers of industrial gases. The Company is party to a long-term take-or-pay supply agreement in effect through August 2017, under which Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products) will supply the Company with bulk nitrogen, oxygen, argon and helium. The Company is committed to purchase approximately $53 million annually in bulk gases under the Air Products supply agreements. The Company also has long-term take-or-pay supply agreements with The Linde Group, AG (Linde AG) to purchase oxygen, nitrogen, argon and helium. The agreements expire at various dates through July 2019 and represent approximately $49 million in annual bulk gas purchases. Additionally, the Company has long-term take-or-pay supply agreements to purchase oxygen, nitrogen and argon from other major producers. The agreements expire at various dates through June 2024, and annual purchases under these contracts are approximately $14 million. The annual purchase commitments above reflect future minimum purchase commitments at current pricing.
5 Table of Contents The supply agreements noted above contain periodic pricing adjustments based on certain economic indices and market analyses. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the supply agreements could differ materially from those presented above due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. If a long-term supply agreement with a major supplier of gases or other raw materials were terminated, the Company would look to utilize available internal production capacity and locate alternative sources of supply to meet customer requirements. The Company purchases hardgoods from major manufacturers and suppliers. For certain products, the Company has negotiated national purchasing arrangements. The Company believes that if an arrangement with any supplier of hardgoods were terminated, it would be able to negotiate comparable alternative supply arrangements.
ALL OTHER OPERATIONS The All Other Operations business segment consists of six business units. The primary products manufactured and/or distributed are carbon dioxide, dry ice (solid form of carbon dioxide), nitrous oxide, ammonia and refrigerant gases. The business units reflected in the All Other Operations business segment individually do not meet the thresholds to be reported as separate business segments.
Carbon Dioxide& Dry Ice Airgas is a leading supplier of liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice. Customers for carbon dioxide and dry ice include food processors, food service businesses, pharmaceutical and biotech industries, and wholesale trade and grocery outlets, with food and beverage applications accounting for approximately 70% of the market. Some seasonality is experienced within this business, as the Company generally experiences a higher level of dry ice sales during the warmer months. With 11 dry ice plants (converting liquid carbon dioxide into dry ice), Airgas has the largest network of dry ice conversion plants in the United States. Additionally, Airgas operates six carbon dioxide production facilities. The Companys carbon dioxide production capacity is supplemented by long-term take-or-pay supply contracts.
Nitrous Oxide Airgas is the largest manufacturer of nitrous oxide gas in the U.S., with four nitrous oxide production facilities operated by the Company. Nitrous oxide is used as an anesthetic in the medical and dental fields, as a propellant in the packaged food business and in the manufacturing process of certain electronics industries. The raw materials utilized in nitrous oxide production are purchased under contracts with major manufacturers and suppliers.
Specialty Products Airgas Specialty Products is a distributor of anhydrous and aqua ammonia. Industrial ammonia applications primarily include the abatement of nitrogen oxide compounds in the utilities industry (DeNOx), chemicals processing, commercial refrigeration, water treatment and metal treatment. Airgas Specialty Products operates 28 distribution facilities across the U.S. and purchases ammonia from suppliers under agreements.
Refrigerants Refrigerants are used in a wide variety of commercial and consumer freezing and cooling applications. Airgas purchases and distributes refrigerants and provides technical and refrigerant reclamation services. The primary focus of the refrigerants business is on the sale and distribution of refrigerants, with a varied customer base that includes small and large HVAC contractors, facility owners, transportation companies, manufacturing facilities and government agencies. The refrigerants business typically experiences some seasonality, with higher sales levels during the warmer months as well as during the March and April timeframe in preparation for the cooling season.
AIRGAS GROWTH STRATEGIES The Companys primary objective is to maximize shareholder value by driving market-leading sales growth through core and strategic product offerings that leverage the Companys infrastructure and customer base, by pursuing acquisitions in the Companys core business and in adjacent businesses, by providing outstanding customer service and by improving operational efficiencies. To meet this objective, the Company is focusing on:  a new customer-centric sales and marketing alignment that provides leadership and strategic support throughout all sales channels, particularly the strategic accounts program, allowing the Company to leverage its unique combination of products, application technology and service, as well as its unrivaled national foot print;  strategic products, which have strong growth profiles due to favorable customer segments, application development, increasing environmental regulation, strong cross-selling opportunities, or a combination thereof (e.g., bulk gases, specialty gases, medical products, carbon dioxide and safety products); 6 Table of Contents  enhanced training, tools and resources for all associates, including installing a new enterprise information system;  reducing costs associated with production, cylinder maintenance and distribution logistics; and  acquisitions to complement and expand its business and to leverage its significant national platform.
REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Companys subsidiaries are subject to federal and state laws and regulations adopted for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of employees and users of the Companys products. The Company has programs for the operation and design of its facilities to achieve compliance with applicable environmental regulations. The Company believes that it is in compliance, in all material respects, with such laws and regulations. Expenditures for environmental compliance purposes during fiscal 2011 were not material.
INSURANCE The Company has established insurance programs to cover workers compensation, business automobile and general liability claims. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, these programs had high deductible limits of $1 million per occurrence. For fiscal 2012, the high deductible limits will remain $1 million per occurrence. The Company accrues estimated losses using actuarial methods and assumptions based on the Companys historical loss experience.
EMPLOYEES On March31, 2011, the Company employed more than 14,000 associates. Less than 5% of the Companys associates were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes it has good relations with its employees and has not experienced a significant strike or work stoppage in over ten years.

ITEM1A.
RISK FACTORS.
In addition to risk factors discussed in MD&A under Critical Accounting Estimates and elsewhere in this report, the Company believes the following, which have not been sequenced in any particular order, are the most significant risks related to our business that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
We face risks related to general economic conditions, which may impact the demand for and supply of our products and our results of operations.
Demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the United States and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the world. Although our diverse product offering and customer base help provide relative stability to our business in difficult times, a broad decline in general economic conditions could result in customers postponing capital projects and could negatively impact the demand for our products and services as well as our customers ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Falling demand could lead to lower sales volumes, lower pricing and/or lower profit margins. A protracted period of lower product demand and profitability could result in diminished values for both tangible and intangible assets, increasing the possibility of future impairment charges. Further, suppliers could be impacted by an economic downturn, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Although current economic conditions are favorable, should economic conditions deteriorate, our financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
We operate in a highly competitive environment and such competition could negatively impact us.
The U.S. industrial gas industry operates in a highly competitive environment. Competition is generally based on price, reliable product delivery, product availability, technical support, quality and service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, we may suffer lower revenue and/or a loss of market share.
9 Table of Contents Increases in product and energy costs could reduce our profitability.
The cost of industrial gases represents a significant percentage of our operating costs. The production of industrial gases requires significant amounts of electric energy. Therefore, industrial gas prices have historically increased as the cost of electric power increases. Price increases for oil and natural gas have historically resulted in electric power surcharges. In addition, a significant portion of our distribution expenses consists of diesel fuel costs. Energy prices can be volatile and may rise in the future, resulting in an increase in the cost of industrial gases and/or the cost to distribute them. While we have historically been able to pass increases in the cost of our products and operating expenses on to our customers, we cannot guarantee our ability to do so in the future, which could negatively impact our operations, financial results or liquidity.
Our financial results may be adversely affected by gas supply disruptions/constraints.
We are the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases in packaged form and have long-term supply contracts with the major gas producers. Additionally, we operate 15 air separation plants, 16 acetylene plants and six carbon dioxide liquification plants, which provide us with substantial production capacity. Our long-term supply contracts and our own production capacity mitigate supply disruptions to various degrees. However, natural disasters, plant shut downs, labor strikes and other supply disruptions may occur within our industry. Regional supply disruptions may create shortages of raw materials and certain products. Consequently, we may not be able to obtain the products required to meet our customers demands or may incur significant cost to ship product from other regions of the country to meet customer requirements. Such additional costs may adversely impact operating results until product sourcing can be restored. In the past, we successfully met customer demand by arranging for alternative supplies and transporting product into an affected region, but we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in arranging alternative product supplies or passing the additional transportation or other costs on to customers in the event of future supply disruptions, which could negatively impact our operations, financial results or liquidity.
U.S. credit markets may impact our ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of future financing.
As of March31, 2011, we had total consolidated debt of approximately $1.9 billion, which had an average length to maturity of approximately four years. During periods of volatility and disruption in the U.S. credit markets, obtaining additional or replacement financing may be more difficult and costly. Higher cost of new debt may limit our ability to finance future acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us. Additionally, although we actively manage our interest rate risk through derivative and diversified debt obligations, approximately 50% of our debt has a variable interest rate. If interest rates increase, our interest expense could increase, affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. Finally, our cost of borrowing can be affected by debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in large part on our performance as measured by certain liquidity metrics. An adverse change in these debt ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and make it more difficult to obtain financing on favorable terms.
We may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies.
We have successfully integrated approximately 400 acquisitions in our history and consider the acquisition and integration of businesses to be a core competency. However, the process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unexpected operating difficulties and may require significant financial and other resources. Unexpected difficulties may impair our ability to achieve targeted synergies or planned operating results, which could diminish the value of acquired tangible and intangible assets resulting in future impairment charges. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:  acquired companies may not have an internal control structure appropriate for a larger public company resulting in a need for significant revisions;  acquired operations, information systems and products may be difficult to integrate;  acquired operations may not achieve targeted synergies;  we may not be able to retain key employees, customers and business relationships of acquired companies; and  our management team may have their attention and resources diverted from ongoing operations.
We depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively and they may be difficult to replace.
Our performance substantially depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, other executive officers and key employees. Furthermore, much of our competitive advantage is based on the expertise, experience and know-how of our key personnel regarding our distribution infrastructure, systems and products. The loss of key employees could have a negative effect on our business, revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
10 Table of Contents We are subject to litigation risk as a result of the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits that arise from our business. Litigation may, for example, relate to product liability claims, vehicle accidents, contractual disputes or employment matters. The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits against us may result in higher operating expenses. Those higher operating expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
We have established insurance programs with significant deductibles and maximum coverage limits which could result in the recognition of significant losses.
We maintain insurance coverage for workers compensation, auto and general liability claims with significant per claim deductibles. In the past, we have incurred significant workers compensation, auto and general liability losses. Such losses could impact our profitability. Additionally, claims in excess of our insurance limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Catastrophic events may disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.
Although our operations are widely distributed across the U.S., a catastrophic event such as a fire or explosion at one of the Companys fill plants or a suppliers plant, or natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, could result in significant property losses, employee injuries and third-party damage claims. Additionally, such events may severely impact our regional customer base and supply sources resulting in lost revenues, higher product costs and increased bad debts.
We are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations that generate ongoing environmental costs and could subject us to liability.
We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources. These include, among other things, reporting on chemical inventories and risk management plans, and management of hazardous substances and wastes, air emissions and water discharges. Violations of existing laws and enactment of future legislation and regulations could result in substantial penalties, temporary or permanent plant closures and legal consequences. Moreover, the nature of our existing and historical operations exposes us to the risk of liabilities to third parties. These potential claims include property damage, personal injuries and cleanup obligations. See Item1, BusinessRegulatory and Environmental Matters above.
More recently, the issue of greenhouse gas emissions has been subject to increased scrutiny, public awareness and evolving legislation, both internationally and in the U.S. Increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose additional costs on us, both directly through new compliance and reporting requirements as well as indirectly through increased industrial gas and energy costs. Until such time that federal legislation is passed in the United States, it will remain unclear as to what industries would be impacted, the period of time within which compliance would be required, the significance of the greenhouse gas emissions reductions and the costs of compliance. Although we do not believe that increased greenhouse gas emissions regulation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, we cannot provide assurance that such costs will not increase in the future or will not become material.
Recent health care legislation in the United States contains provisions that will significantly impact government reimbursement of health-care costs. Many of these provisions will be effective in future years. Therefore, this legislations impact on our health-care customers and the products and services we offer them is unclear and may be detrimental. We continue to monitor developments with respect to this evolving legislation.
We face risks in connection with our current project to install a new enterprise information system for our business.
We continue our phased implementation of a new enterprise information system (SAP) for many aspects of our business. The implementation is a technically intensive process, requiring testing, modifications and project coordination. Although our SAP implementation process includes more than fifteen months of design and testing, which is intended to minimize business disruption and conversion risks, we may experience disruptions in our business operations related to this implementation effort. Such disruptions could result in material adverse consequences, including delays in the design and implementation of the system, loss of information, loss of personnel, a reduction in our ability to process transactions, harm to our control environment, and unanticipated increases in costs.
11 Table of Contents We face risks in connection with our new divisional alignment and restructuring of our accounting and certain administrative functions.
In May 2011 in conjunction with the SAP implementation, we announced that we will consolidate the accounting and certain administrative functions of our twelve regional distribution companies into four Business Support Centers. Currently, each of the regional distribution companies operates with its own accounting group and administrative functions. The consolidation of our regional company accounting and certain administrative functions is expected to support the net operating income benefits anticipated as part of the SAP project. However, the cost of such consolidation, which includes severance, transition staffing, relocation and other costs, could exceed our estimates. The administrative efficiencies, which we believe will result from the consolidation, may not be realized to the extent anticipated, thereby reducing the operating income benefit. Additionally, key personnel may not relocate to the new Business Support Centers and employees affected by the consolidation may leave us prior to completing the transition efforts, which may slow the process and increase its cost.
We face risks that the full amount and/or timing of the anticipated net operating income benefits from our SAP implementation may not be realized.
We have announced expected incremental annual operating income benefits in the range of $75 to $125 million on an annual run-rate basis. By December 2013, we expect to be at the run-rate of the mid-point of the target operating income benefits range. However, unanticipated delays in the SAP system implementation could adversely affect the timing of when these benefits may be realized. In addition, adverse market conditions could slow anticipated accelerated sales growth, the realization of pricing management benefits, and attainment of administrative and operating efficiencies.
Market conditions and other uncertainties may unfavorably impact our withdrawal liabilities from multi-employer pension plans.
We have and continue to participate in multi-employer pension plans that provide defined benefits to union employees under the provisions of collective bargaining agreements. Multi-employer pension plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. As we negotiate changes in collective bargaining agreements and cease making contributions to certain multi-employer pension plans, estimates for withdrawal liabilities must be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. At March 31, 2011, estimated liabilities for multi-employer pension plans from which we have withdrawn amounted to $16 million. These estimates and estimates for plans in which we still participate are based on numerous assumptions that continually change and information that is not always current, and can take a number of years to settle. Furthermore, the investment assets in these plans are subject to market fluctuations and may significantly increase potential withdrawal liabilities during market downturns. As a result, increases in future withdrawal liabilities from multi-employer pension plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

PROPERTIES.
The Company operates in 48 states, Canada and to a lesser extent Mexico, Russia, Dubai and Europe. The principal executive offices of the Company are located in leased space in Radnor, Pennsylvania.
The Companys Distribution business segment operates a network of multiple use facilities consisting of more than 875 branches, approximately 300 cylinder fill plants, 61 regional specialty gas laboratories, nine national specialty gas laboratories, one medical equipment facility, one research and development center, one specialty gas equipment center, 16 acetylene plants and 15 air separation units, as well as six national hardgoods distribution centers, various customer call centers, buying centers and administrative offices. The Distribution business segment conducts business in 48 states and internationally in Canada, Mexico, Russia, Dubai and Europe. The Company owns approximately 42% of these facilities. The remaining facilities are primarily leased from third parties. A limited number of facilities are leased from employees, generally former owners of acquired businesses, and are on terms consistent with commercial rental rates prevailing in the surrounding rental market.
The Companys All Other Operations business segment consists of businesses, located throughout the United States, which operate multiple use facilities consisting of approximately 75 branch/distribution locations, six liquid carbon dioxide and 11 dry ice production facilities, and four nitrous oxide production facilities. The Company owns approximately 26% of these facilities. The remaining facilities are leased from third parties.
12 Table of Contents During fiscal 2011, the Companys production facilities operated at approximately 72% of capacity based on an average daily production period of 16 hours. If required, additional shifts could be run to expand production capacity.
The Company believes that its facilities are adequate for its present needs and that its properties are generally in good condition, well maintained and suitable for their intended use.
ITEM3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
The Company is involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. These actions, when ultimately concluded and determined, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect upon the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
On February11, 2010, Air Products initiated an unsolicited tender offer for all of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with this tender offer, Air Products filed an action against the Company and members of its Board in the Delaware Court of Chancery. In the suit, Air Products sought, among other things, an order declaring that members of the Companys Board breached their fiduciary duties by refusing to negotiate with Air Products. Additionally, a number of purported stockholder class action lawsuits were commenced against the Company and/or the members of the Airgas Board in the Delaware Court of Chancery. These suits, which were later consolidated, alleged, among other things, that the members of the Airgas Board breached their fiduciary duties by refusing to negotiate with Air Products, failing to seek more valuable alternatives and failing to redeem the Companys shareholder rights plan.
On February15, 2011, the Delaware Court of Chancery denied in their entirety all requests for relief by Air Products and by the plaintiffs in the stockholder class action lawsuits, and dismissed with prejudice all claims asserted against the Company and its directors. Air Products promptly terminated its unsolicited tender offer and no appeal of the Courts decision was filed by Air Products or the stockholder plaintiffs.
As disclosed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company incurred substantial legal and professional fees related to the Air Products takeover attempt and litigation through March31, 2011.

Also included in the results for fiscal 2011 are a charge of $4.2 million ($2.6 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share for the early extinguishment of debt and a one-time interest penalty of $2.6 million ($1.7 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share related to the late removal of the restrictive legend on the Companys 7.125% senior subordinated notes. On April1, 2010, the Company adopted a new accounting standard for transfers of financial assets, which affected the accounting treatment of its trade receivables securitization program. The Company participates in a trade receivables securitization agreement (the Securitization Agreement) with three commercial banks to which it sells qualifying trade receivables on a revolving basis. The amount of receivables securitized under the Securitization Agreement was $295 million at March31, 2011. Under the new guidance, proceeds received under the Securitization Agreement are treated as secured borrowings, whereas previously they were treated as proceeds from the sale of trade receivables. The impact of the new accounting treatment resulted in the recognition, in fiscal 2011, of both the trade receivables securitized under the program and the borrowings they collateralize, which led to a $295 million increase in working capital, total assets and long-term debt in the table above. With respect to the Companys operating results, the amounts previously recorded within the line item Discount on securitization of trade receivables, are now reflected within Interest expense, net as borrowing costs, consistent with the new accounting treatment. There was no impact to the Companys consolidated net earnings as a result of the change in accounting principle.
(2) As discussed in Item7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in the notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, the results for fiscal 2010 include $23.4 million ($14.8 million after tax) or $0.18 per diluted share in costs related to an unsolicited takeover attempt and $6.7 million ($4.1 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share in multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges. Also included in the results for fiscal 2010 are a charge of $17.9 million ($11.3 million after tax) or $0.14 per diluted share for the early extinguishment of debt and a tax benefit of $2.2 million or $0.03 per diluted share associated with the reorganization of certain facilities within the All Other Operations business segment. Additionally, certain reclassifications were made to the operating results in the table above to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications resulted in increasing revenue, as well as expenses, for the fiscal years 2010 and prior and were not material. The Companys operating income and net earnings for the prior period were not impacted by the reclassifications.
(3) The results for fiscal 2008 include a one-time, non-cash, after tax charge of $2.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to the National Welders Exchange Transaction through which the joint venture became a 100% owned subsidiary. Also included in the results for fiscal 2008 is a tax benefit of $1.3 million or $0.01 per diluted share, due to additional guidance issued with respect to a prior year change in Texas state income tax law. Fiscal 2008 acquisition integration costs, principally related to the Linde AG Bulk Gas and Linde AG Packaged Gas acquisitions, were $10.1 million ($6.2 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share.
(4) The results for fiscal 2007 include a charge of $12.1 million ($7.9 million after tax), or $0.10 per diluted share, for the early extinguishment of debt and a tax benefit of $0.02 per diluted share related to a change in Texas state income tax law.
(5) The Company paid its stockholders quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share at the end of the first quarter and $0.25 per share at end of the second and third quarters of fiscal 2011. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company paid dividends of $0.29 per share. In fiscal 2010, the Company paid its stockholders quarterly cash dividends of $0.18 per share at the end of each of the first three quarters and $0.22 per share in the fourth quarter. During fiscal 2009, the Company paid regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.12 per share at the end of each of the first two quarters and $0.16 per share in the third and fourth quarters. During fiscal 2008, the Company paid regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.09 per share during the first three quarters and $0.12 per share during the fourth quarter. In fiscal 2007, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per share. On May17, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share, which is payable on June30, 2011 to stockholders of record as of June15, 2011. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 OVERVIEW Airgas had net sales for the fiscal year ended March31, 2011 (fiscal 2011 or current year) of $4.3 billion compared to $3.9 billion for the fiscal year ended March31, 2010 (fiscal 2010 or prior year), an increase of 10%. Total same-store sales increased 8%, with hardgoods up 11% and gas and rent up 7%. Acquisitions contributed 2% sales growth in the current year. The same-store sales growth for the current year was driven by both volume and price, with sales volumes up 5% and pricing up 3%. The increase in sales volumes reflects accelerating growth in the Companys core business on strength in the manufacturing, utilities and petrochemical customer segments, as the manufacturing recovery that began in the central regions of the U.S. among the Companys larger customers expanded more broadly throughout the country and to smaller manufacturers. The Companys medical business also began to accelerate, and the Company experienced increased activity in customers using Airgas products and services for repair and maintenance operations. The increase in pricing reflects a broad-based price increase on gas, rent and hardgoods effective June1, 2010, and to a lesser extent, a price increase on gas, rent and other service charges on March1, 2011. The pricing actions were designed to offset rising product, operating and distribution costs.
The Companys operating income margin increased 70 basis points to 11.0% in the current year compared to 10.3% in the prior year. The current years operating income margin reflected a 110 basis point improvement in the operating income margin driven by operating leverage on sales growth in the current year, offset by $44.4 million in costs related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and $4.6 million in charges related to the Companys withdrawal from some of its multi-employer pension plans (MEPPs), which together reduced the Companys operating income margin by 120 basis points. The Companys operating income margin in the prior year reflected the impact of $23.4 million in costs related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and $6.7 million in MEPP withdrawal charges, which reduced the prior years operating income margin by 80 basis points.
Net earnings per diluted share rose 25% to $2.93 in the current year versus $2.34 in the prior year. Net earnings per diluted share in the current year included special charges aggregating to $0.41 per diluted share comprised of $0.33 per diluted share in costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, $0.03 per diluted share in MEPP withdrawal charges, $0.03 per diluted share in losses on the extinguishment of debt and $0.02 per diluted share for a one-time interest penalty. Net earnings per diluted share in the prior year included net special charges aggregating to $0.34 per diluted share comprised of $0.18 per diluted share in costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, $0.05 per diluted share in MEPP withdrawal charges, $0.14 per diluted share in losses on the extinguishment of debt and a $0.03 per diluted share income tax benefit associated with the reorganization of certain facilities within the All Other Operations business segment. The special charges reduced reported net earnings per diluted share by 12% in fiscal 2011 and 13% in fiscal 2010.
Fiscal 2012 Outlook Looking forward, the Company expects earnings per diluted share for the first quarter ending June30, 2011 in the range of $0.82 to $0.87. The earnings per diluted share range for the first quarter includes an estimated $0.10 per diluted share of restructuring charges and $0.08 per diluted share of implementation costs and depreciation expense associated with the Companys SAP implementation. For the full year ending March31, 2012 (fiscal 2012), the Company expects earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.58 to $3.73, which includes an estimated $0.17 per diluted share of restructuring charges and $0.32 per diluted share of implementation costs and depreciation expense associated with its SAP implementation. Guidance for both the first quarter ending June30, 2011 and fiscal 2012 also includes the impact of the Companys repurchase of 4.8million shares of common stock completed in the quarter ended March31, 2011. The above guidance excludes any potential MEPP withdrawal charges that may arise from the three remaining collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), covering approximately 30 employees who participate in MEPPs, that come up for renewal in fiscal 2012, and excludes the impact, if any, of the new share repurchase program announced on May5, 2011.
Enterprise Information System The Company continues its phased, multi-year rollout of its highly-customized SAP enterprise information system, with the successful conversion of the first regional distribution company on April4, 2011. The Company continues to prepare for the implementation of SAP at the remainder of its business units, the next of which is scheduled to convert in September 2011. The conversion schedule accelerates thereafter, with all regional distribution companies expected to be converted to SAP by the first half of fiscal 2013.
17 Table of Contents The Company expects to incur the highest level of expenses related to the SAP implementation in fiscal 2012, as the majority of the regional distribution companies are converted during the year. Total implementation costs and depreciation expense related to the SAP system are expected to be $0.08 per diluted share for the quarter ending June30, 2011 and $0.32 per diluted share for fiscal 2012.
During fiscal 2011, the Company quantified the economic benefits expected to be achieved through its implementation of SAP in the key areas of accelerated sales growth through expansion of the telesales platform, price management, and administrative and operating efficiencies. Upon full implementation, the Company expects these areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run-rate basis. By December 2013, the Company expects to be at the run-rate of the mid-point of the target operating income benefits range. Excluding depreciation, total SAP project expenditures are expected to be approximately $186 million, with an estimated $91 million in expense and $95 million in capitalized costs. Through March31, 2011, the Company had recognized $116 million in total SAP project expenditures, with $29 million in expense and $87 million in capitalized costs.
New Divisional Alignment In conjunction with the SAP implementation, in May 2011, the Company announced a reorganization of its twelve regional distribution companies. Currently, each of the regional distribution companies operates with its own accounting group and administrative functions. In order to more effectively utilize the Companys resources across regional company boundaries, Airgas will realign its regional company support functions, including accounting and certain administrative functions, into four divisional Business Support Centers. With the Companys conversion to a single dataset across all of the regional companies as part of the SAP implementation, the consolidation of the Companys regional company accounting and certain administrative functions will support the efficiencies expected to be realized as part of the SAP project.
As a result of the reorganization, the Company will incur restructuring charges, including severance, transition staffing, relocation and other costs. In fiscal 2012, the Company expects to incur restructuring charges of $21 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, of which $13 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, is expected to occur in the first quarter ending June30, 2011 primarily related to severance. The reorganization is expected to be complete in fiscal 2013, and the Company expects to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $6 million, primarily related to transition staffing, relocation and other costs during such fiscal year. The benefits enabled by the new divisional alignment are included in the benefits expected to be realized from the SAP implementation quantified above.
Stock Repurchase Program On May5, 2011, the Company announced a new program to repurchase up to $300 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. The Company may repurchase shares from time to time for cash in open market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The Company will determine the timing and the amount of any repurchases based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. The stock repurchase program will be funded under the Companys existing credit facility, has no pre-established closing date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The impact of the May 2011 stock repurchase program has not been included in the Companys forward-looking guidance.
Multi-employer Pension Plan Withdrawals During fiscal 2012, the three remaining CBAs that provide for MEPPs and cover a total of approximately 30 employees will come up for renewal. The Company intends to negotiate its withdrawal from these plans and, if successful in its negotiations, expects to incur charges related to these plans in fiscal 2012. Assuming a complete withdrawal from these MEPPs, the Company estimates the additional withdrawal liability to be approximately $5 million as of March31, 2011. The Companys guidance for both the first quarter ending June30, 2011 and the full year fiscal 2012 does not include any potential MEPP withdrawal charges that may arise from the three remaining CBAs that come up for renewal in fiscal 2012.
Supply Constraints The industrial gas industry is working through supply constraints related to calcium carbide, which is the raw material used in the generation of acetylene gas, as a result of a catastrophic explosion at one of two plants of the countrys primary supplier of calcium carbide. Due to the calcium carbide supply disruption, costs of acetylene are escalating as a result of both rising raw materials and distribution costs. The Company is utilizing a combination of alternatives to compensate for the lack of calcium carbide, including increased use of chemical acetylene, reallocation of available calcium carbide, potential sourcing of calcium carbide from outside of the U.S. and customer adoption of alternative fuel gases where appropriate. To help mitigate the financial impact to Airgas, the Company has already instituted product allocations and surcharges related to bulk and cylinder acetylene. Sales of acetylene represent approximately 3% of the Companys consolidated gas and rent net sales.
18 Table of Contents STATEMENT OF EARNINGS COMMENTARY  Fiscal Year Ended March31, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March31, 2010 Certain reclassifications were made to the Companys Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal years 2010 and 2009 to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications resulted in increasing revenue and selling, distribution and administrative expenses and reducing cost of products sold (excluding depreciation). These reclassifications were the result of conforming the Companys accounting policies in conjunction with its implementation of the SAP system and were not material. Consolidated operating income and net earnings for the prior periods were not impacted by the reclassifications.
Additionally, certain reclassifications were made to the presentation of business segment operating results for the prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications were the result of changes made to the allocation of corporate operating expenses. Although corporate operating expenses are generally allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars, the Company reports expenses related to the implementation of its SAP system and costs associated with the Companys withdrawal from various MEPPs under selling, distribution and administrative expenses as other expenses that are not allocated to the Companys business segments. Previously, these costs were allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars. Consolidated operating income and net earnings for the prior periods were not impacted by these reclassifications. Additionally, the legal and professional fees incurred as a result of Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt were not allocated to the Companys business segments. These costs are also reflected in the other line item in the tables below.
Business segment information and income statement commentary related to the prior periods have been recast to reflect the reclassifications described above.
Net Sales Net sales increased 10% to $4.3 billion for the current year compared to the prior year, driven by same-store sales growth of 8% and incremental sales of 2% contributed by acquisitions. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 11%. Same-store sales were driven by increased volumes of 5% and price of 3%.
Strategic products account for more than 40% of net sales and include safety products, bulk, medical and specialty gases, as well as carbon dioxide and dry ice. The Company has identified these products as strategic because it believes they have good long-term growth profiles relative to the Companys core industrial gas and welding products due to favorable end customer markets, application development, increasing environmental regulation, strong cross-selling opportunities or a combination thereof. For the current year, sales of strategic products increased 9% on a same-store sales basis as compared to the prior year, which was slightly stronger than the overall same-store sales increase of 8%.
The Company estimates same-store sales growth based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales reported in the prior period. The table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same-store sales metric. The intercompany eliminations represent sales from the All Other Operations business segment to the Distribution business segment.
Net Sales Year Ended March31, 2011 2010 Increase (In thousands) Distribution $ 3,810,136 $ 3,478,475 $ 331,661 10 % All Other Operations 472,054 420,941 51,113 12 % Intercompany eliminations (30,723 ) (24,263 ) (6,460 ) $ 4,251,467 $ 3,875,153 $ 376,314 10 % The Distribution business segments principal products include industrial, medical and specialty gases, and process chemicals; cylinder and equipment rental; and hardgoods. Industrial, medical and specialty gases are distributed in cylinders and bulk containers. Equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk and micro-bulk tanks, tube trailers and welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding consumables and equipment, safety products, construction supplies and maintenance, repair and operating supplies.
19 Table of Contents Distribution business segment sales increased 10% compared to the prior year with an increase in same-store sales of 8% and incremental sales of 2% contributed by current and prior year acquisitions. The Distribution business segments gas and rent same-store sales increased 6% with volumes and pricing each up 3%. Hardgoods same-store sales increased 11% with volumes up 9% and pricing up 2%. Both gas and rent and hardgoods volumes reflect the overall improvement in economic activity, while the increase in pricing was primarily driven by the June1, 2010 and March1, 2011 price increases.
Sales of strategic gas products sold through the Distribution business segment in the current year increased 8% from the prior year. Among strategic gas products, bulk gas sales were up 10% as bulk sales to industrial manufacturing and petrochemical customers continued to recover, and bulk nitrogen for food-freezing applications continued to show strength. Sales of medical gases were up 4% as a result of new business signings, partially offset by a reduction in elective and non-critical medical procedures, which reduced overall demand. Sales of specialty gases were up 8% driven primarily by higher volumes and increased demand for core specialty gases. The rising demand for the Companys core specialty gases reflects further strengthening of the Companys market position in EPA protocols and other calibration gas mixtures, improving conditions in petrochemical markets and spot sales of certain rare gases in the fiscal second quarter.
Contributing to the rise in Distribution business segment hardgoods same-store sales were increases in both safety products and the Companys Radnor  private-label brand product line. Safety product sales increased 13% in the current year, comparing favorably to the overall hardgoods same-store sales increase of 11% and reflecting broad-based increases that were most pronounced in the manufacturing customer base. The Companys Radnor  private-label line was up 15% for the current year, driven by the overall increase in hardgoods volumes.
Sales of core industrial gases, which experienced the sharpest volume declines during the recession, increased 6% for the current year as compared to the prior year, reflecting accelerating growth in the Companys core business. Revenues from the Companys rental welder business experienced a 5% decline in same-store sales during the current year as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of continued weakness in non-residential construction.
The All Other Operations business segment consists of six business units. The primary products manufactured and/or distributed are carbon dioxide, dry ice, nitrous oxide, ammonia and refrigerant gases.
The All Other Operations business segment sales increased 12% in total and on a same-store basis compared to the prior year. The sales increase was driven by higher pricing and volumes for certain products in the refrigerants business and for ammonia used in DeNOx applications and chemicals processing, as well as higher volumes in the carbon dioxide and dry ice businesses.
Gross Profits (Excluding Depreciation) Gross profits (excluding depreciation) do not reflect deductions related to depreciation expense and distribution costs. The Company reflects distribution costs as an element of selling, distribution and administrative expenses and recognizes depreciation on all its property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings line item, Depreciation. Other companies may report certain or all of these costs as elements of their cost of products sold and, as such, the Companys gross profits (excluding depreciation) discussed below may not be comparable to those of other businesses.
Consolidated gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased 9% compared to the prior year, principally due to the same-store sales increase for the current year. The consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) in the current year declined 40 basis points to 55.0% compared to 55.4% in the prior year. The decline in consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) primarily reflects the sales mix shift toward lower-margin hardgoods that is characteristic of an industrial economic recovery.
Gross Profits (Excluding Depreciation) Year Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2011 2010 Increase Distribution $ 2,117,270 $ 1,948,868 $ 168,402 9 % All Other Operations 220,107 198,419 21,688 11 % $ 2,337,377 $ 2,147,287 $ 190,090 9 % The Distribution business segments gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased 9% compared to the prior year. The Distribution business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was 55.6% versus 56.0% in the prior year, a decrease of 40 basis points. The decline in the Distribution business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) largely reflects the shift in sales mix toward hardgoods, which carry lower gross profit margins (excluding depreciation) than gas and rent. As a percentage of the Distribution business segments sales, gas and rent decreased 120 basis points to 59.6% in the current year as compared to 60.8% in the prior year.
20 Table of Contents The All Other Operations business segments gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased 11% compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of favorable pricing and product mix for the refrigerants, carbon dioxide and dry ice businesses. The All Other Operations business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) decreased 50 basis points to 46.6% in the current year from 47.1% in the prior year. The decrease in the All Other Operations business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was primarily driven by higher costs in the ammonia business relative to pricing.
Operating Expenses Selling, distribution and administrative (SD&A) expenses consist of labor and overhead associated with the purchasing, marketing and distributing of the Companys products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting, tax and facility-related expenses. Consolidated SD&A expenses increased $85 million, or 6%, in the current year as compared to the prior year. Contributing to the increase in SD&A expenses were $65 million of higher variable costs associated with growing sales, such as sales commissions, performance bonuses, production overtime and distribution costs, approximately $13 million of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses and $9 million in incremental costs associated with the SAP implementation, slightly offset by $2 million of lower MEPP withdrawal charges. As a percentage of net sales, SD&A expense decreased 140 basis points to 37.0% compared to 38.4% in the prior year driven by operating leverage on sales growth and by the shift in sales mix to hardgoods, which carry lower operating expenses in relation to sales and corresponding lower gross margins. Although corporate operating expenses are generally allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars, the Company reports SD&A expenses related to the implementation of its SAP system and the Companys withdrawal from various MEPPs in the other line item in the table below.
SD&A Expenses Year Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2011 2010 Increase Distribution $ 1,418,491 $ 1,348,022 $ 70,469 5 % All Other Operations 134,578 127,250 7,328 6 % Other 21,003 14,033 6,970 $ 1,574,072 $ 1,489,305 $ 84,767 6 % SD&A expenses in the Distribution and All Other Operations business segments increased 5% and 6%, respectively, in the current year. For both business segments, the increases in SD&A costs were driven by higher variable costs on sales growth, including sales commissions, performance bonuses, production overtime and distribution costs, and approximately $13 million of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses, the majority of which was incurred in the Distribution business segment. As a percentage of Distribution business segment net sales, SD&A expense in the Distribution business segment decreased 160 basis points to 37.2% compared to 38.8% in the prior year driven by operating leverage on sales growth and by the shift in sales mix to hardgoods. As a percentage of All Other Operations business segment net sales, SD&A expense in the All Other Operations business segment decreased 170 basis points to 28.5% compared to 30.2% in the prior year, driven primarily by operating leverage on sales growth in the refrigerants, carbon dioxide and dry ice businesses.
Enterprise Information System On July5, 2010, the Company began its phased, multi-year rollout of its highly-customized SAP enterprise information system, whereby business units will implement the new system in succession, with the successful conversion of its Safety telesales and hardgoods infrastructure business to SAP. On April4, 2011, the first regional distribution company successfully converted to SAP. The Company continues to prepare for the implementation of SAP at the remainder of its business units. SAP costs for the current year were $16.4 million as compared to $7.4 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the post-implementation monitoring, training and operating activities following the rollout of SAP to the Companys Safety telesales and hardgoods infrastructure business, and pre-implementation data conversion and training related to the rollout of SAP to the first regional distribution company. These costs were recorded as SD&A expenses and were not allocated to the Companys business segments. SAP implementation costs for fiscal 2012 to be reflected in SD&A expenses are expected to increase to $36 million as the Company accelerates the rollout of the system to the other regional distribution companies.
Multi-employer Pension Plan Withdrawals The Company participates, with other employers, in a number of MEPPs providing defined benefits to union employees under the terms of CBAs. Contributions are made to the plans in accordance with those CBAs. The plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers.
21 Table of Contents As CBAs came up for renewal, the Company actively negotiated the withdrawal from MEPPs replacing those retirement plans for CBA employees with defined contribution plans. As part of the withdrawal from a MEPP, the Company is required to fund its portion of the MEPPs unfunded pension obligation. The ultimate amount of the withdrawal liability assessed by the MEPP is impacted by a number of factors, including investment returns, benefits levels and continued participation by other employers in the MEPP. The computation of the Companys portion of a plans unfunded obligation may take up to 24 months for the pension plan administrators to prepare. As a result, the Company has recorded estimated liabilities for these withdrawals based on the latest information available to the Company from the plans. MEPP withdrawal costs for the current year were $4.6 million and related to the ratification of certain CBAs up for renewal as well as revised estimated withdrawal liabilities from two plan administrators. In connection with the renewal of certain labor contracts during the prior year, the Company recognized MEPP withdrawal charges of $6.7 million in the prior year. These charges were reflected in SD&A expenses and were not allocated to the Companys business segments.
Unsolicited Takeover Attempt On February11, 2010, Air Products initiated an unsolicited tender offer for all of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with this unsolicited takeover attempt, Air Products filed an action against the Company and members of its Board in the Delaware Court of Chancery. In the suit, Air Products sought, among other things, an order declaring that members of the Companys Board breached their fiduciary duties by refusing to negotiate with Air Products. Additionally, a number of purported stockholder class action lawsuits were commenced against the Company and/or the members of the Airgas Board in the Delaware Court of Chancery. These suits, which were later consolidated, alleged, among other things, that the members of the Airgas Board breached their fiduciary duties by refusing to negotiate with Air Products, failing to seek more valuable alternatives and failing to redeem the Companys shareholder rights plan.
Air Products also initiated a proxy contest to elect three directors to Airgas Board and to amend certain provisions of the Companys By-Laws. At the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company on September15, 2010, the three nominees of Air Products were elected to the Companys Board of Directors and a majority of the shares voted, though less than 67% of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote, were voted in favor of the By-Law amendments proposed by Air Products. Airgas and certain of its directors initiated an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that the By-Law amendment requiring that an annual meeting be held on January18, 2011, only four months after the September15, 2010 annual meeting, was invalid under both Delaware law and Airgas charter. In a ruling dated October8, 2010, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that the By-Law amendment was valid. Airgas and the directors involved appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court of Delaware and on November23, 2010, the Supreme Court of Delaware found that the By-Law amendment was invalid and reversed the judgment of the Court of Chancery.
On February15, 2011, the Delaware Court of Chancery denied in their entirety all requests for relief by Air Products and by the plaintiffs in the stockholder class action lawsuits, and dismissed with prejudice all claims asserted against the Company and its directors. Air Products promptly terminated its unsolicited tender offer and no appeal of the Courts decision was filed by Air Products or the stockholder plaintiffs.
During the current year, the Company incurred $44.4 million of legal and professional fees and other costs related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and the related litigation compared to $23.4 million in the prior year. The costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt were reflected as a separate line item in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Earnings, and were not allocated to the Companys business segments.
Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation expense of $225 million increased $13 million, or 6%, in the current year as compared to $213 million in the prior year. The increase primarily reflects capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand (such as cylinders and bulk tanks) and $2 million of incremental depreciation expense related to the SAP enterprise information system. Amortization expense of $25 million in the current year increased by $3 million as compared to the prior year reflecting amortization of intangibles acquired during both the current and prior years. Depreciation expense related to the SAP system is expected to increase to $8 million in fiscal 2012 without the benefit of full implementation of the system.
22 Table of Contents Operating Income Consolidated operating income of $468 million increased 17% in the current year driven by operating leverage on sales growth which more than offset the impact of costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, higher variable costs associated with sales growth, and incremental SAP implementation costs, slightly offset by lower MEPP withdrawal charges. The consolidated operating income margin, which was negatively impacted by significant costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, increased to 11.0% from 10.3% in the prior year. Although corporate operating expenses are generally allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars, the Company reports SD&A expenses related to the implementation of its SAP system and the Companys withdrawal from various MEPPs in the other line item in the table below. Additionally, the legal and professional fees and other costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt are not allocated to the Companys business segments, and are also reflected in the other line item in the table below.
Operating Income Year Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2011 2010 Increase Distribution $ 468,295 $ 384,584 $ 83,711 22 % All Other Operations 65,495 52,482 13,013 25 % Other (65,409 ) (37,468 ) (27,941 ) $ 468,381 $ 399,598 $ 68,783 17 % Operating income in the Distribution business segment increased 22% in the current year. The Distribution business segments operating income margin increased 120 basis points to 12.3% compared to 11.1% in the prior year. The operating income margin increase was driven by operating leverage on sales growth in the current year which more than offset higher variable costs associated with sales growth.
Operating income in the All Other Operations business segment increased 25% compared to the prior year. The All Other Operations business segments operating income margin of 13.9% was 140 basis points higher than the operating income margin of 12.5% in the prior year. The increase in operating margin was driven primarily by operating leverage on sales growth in the refrigerants, carbon dioxide and dry ice businesses, partially offset by the impact of gross margin compression in the ammonia business.
Interest Expense, Net, Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt Interest expense, net, was $60 million in the current year, representing a decrease of approximately $9 million, or 13%, compared to interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables in the prior year. As a result of a change in accounting treatment effective April1, 2010 related to the Companys trade receivables securitization program, costs formerly recognized as discount on securitization of trade receivables, which represented the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale, are now reflected as interest expense, consistent with the new accounting treatment. The overall decrease in interest expense, net (including the discount on securitization of trade receivables in the prior year) resulted primarily from lower average debt balances in the current year as compared to aggregate debt and trade receivables securitization balances in the prior year, partially offset by a $2.6 million one-time interest penalty in the current year related to the 7.125% senior subordinated notes due October1, 2018 (the 2018 Notes).
Interest Penalty During the current year, the Company incurred a one-time interest penalty to the holders of its 2018 Notes in the amount of $2.6 million related to the late removal of the restrictive legend on these notes. In issuing the 2018 Notes, the Company utilized a newly available technology that has since become obsolete, wherein it was incumbent upon Airgas to remove the restrictive legend from the 2018 Notes at the end of the restricted transfer period. Failure to do so required the payment of an interest penalty to holders of the 2018 Notes, which the Company promptly addressed when it identified the oversight. The Company has classified this penalty as interest expense.
23 Table of Contents Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in the Securitization Agreement with three commercial banks to which it sells qualifying trade receivables on a revolving basis.The maximum amount of the Securitization Agreement is $295 million. On April1, 2010, the Company adopted new accounting guidance which affected the presentation of its Securitization Agreement. Under the new guidance, proceeds received under the Securitization Agreement are treated as secured borrowings, whereas previously they were treated as proceeds from the sale of trade receivables. Furthermore, the new accounting treatment resulted in the recognition of both the trade receivables securitized under the agreement and the borrowings they collateralize on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet, which led to a $295 million increase in trade receivables and long-term debt. There was no impact to the Companys consolidated net earnings as a result of the change in accounting principle. Additionally, the Companys debt covenants were not impacted by the balance sheet recognition of the borrowings under the new accounting guidance, as borrowings under the Securitization Agreement were already factored into the debt covenant calculations.
Financing and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt On September13, 2010, the Company entered into a new four-year $750 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). In connection with the entry into the Credit Facility, the Company terminated its $1.7 billion credit facility (the Prior Credit Facility), which was scheduled to mature on July25, 2011. All obligations outstanding under the Prior Credit Facility were repaid using proceeds of the Credit Facility and other funds. As a result of the early termination of the Prior Credit Facility, the Company recognized a loss of $0.6 million associated with the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.
Additionally, during the current year, the Company repurchased $30 million of its 2018 Notes at an average price of 110.6% of the principal. In conjunction with the repurchase of the 2018 Notes, the Company recognized losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $3.6 million. The losses reflected the redemption premiums as well as the write-off of associated unamortized debt issuance costs. In connection with the prior year repurchase of $154 million of the 2018 Notes and the redemption in full of the $150 million 6.25% senior subordinated notes due July15, 2014 (the 2004 Notes), the Company recognized losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million in the prior year. The losses related to the redemption premiums and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.
Stock Repurchase Program In February 2011, the Companys Executive Committee of the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that provided the Company with the authorization to repurchase up to $300 million of its common stock. By March31, 2011, 4.8million shares had been repurchased for $300 million.
Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 38.5% of pre-tax earnings in the current year compared to 37.5% in the prior year. The lower tax rate for the prior year reflects the impact of tax benefits of $2.2 million associated with the reorganization of certain facilities within the All Other Operations business segment and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions. The Company expects the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 to be between 38.0% and 39.0% of pre-tax earnings.
Net Earnings Net earnings were $250 million, or $2.93 per diluted share, compared to $196 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, in the prior year. The current years net earnings include costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt of $44.4 million ($28.0 million after tax) or $0.33 per diluted share, charges related to withdrawals from MEPPs of $4.6 million ($2.8 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share, losses related to the early extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million ($2.6 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share and costs related to the one-time interest penalty of $2.6 million ($1.7 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share. The prior years net earnings include costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt of $23.4 million ($14.8 million after tax) or $0.18 per diluted share, charges related to withdrawals from MEPPs of $6.7 million ($4.1 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share, losses related to the early extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million ($11.3 million after tax) or $0.14 per diluted share and a one-time income tax benefit of $2.2 million or $0.03 per diluted share.
24 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 OVERVIEW Airgas had net sales for fiscal 2010 of $3.9 billion compared to $4.4 billion for the fiscal year ended March31, 2009 (fiscal 2009). The fiscal 2010 net sales reflected a challenging sales environment due to the economic downturn in the U.S. For fiscal 2010, net sales decreased by 11% driven by a decline in same-store sales offset slightly by the impact of current and prior year acquisitions. The decline in same-store sales contributed 14% to the decrease in total sales, driven by a 13% decrease in sales volume and a 1% decrease in pricing. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 3% for fiscal 2010. Lower sales volumes reflected the effects of the economic recession in the U.S. and decreased demand, especially in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, across all customer and geographic segments. Steep declines in the Companys selling price to customers in response to price reductions from the Companys suppliers for ammonia and filler metals accounted for the majority of the pricing decline. The Companys strategic products and related growth initiatives helped to somewhat mitigate the impact of the economic downturn.
Operating income margin declined 170 basis points to 10.3% in fiscal 2010 compared to 12.0% in fiscal 2009. The decline in the fiscal 2010 operating income margin reflected the impact of lower sales as well as $23.4 million in costs related to the Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and $6.7 million in MEPP withdrawal charges, partially offset by the impact of cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives and a favorable sales mix shift from hardgoods to gas and rent sales. The costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt and the MEPP charges accounted for 80 basis points (44%)of the decline in operating income margin. Net earnings per diluted share fell 25% to $2.34 in fiscal 2010 versus $3.12 in fiscal 2009. The results reflect lower operating income as well as losses on the extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million, partially offset by lower borrowing costs in fiscal 2010 and a $2.2 million or $0.03 per diluted share income tax benefit associated with the reorganization of certain facilities within the All Other Operations business segment. The costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, MEPP charges and debt extinguishment charges accounted for over half of the decline in net earnings per diluted share.
Multi-employer Pension Plan Withdrawal In connection with the renewal of certain CBAs during fiscal 2010, the Company negotiated its withdrawal from participation in underfunded MEPPs and will instead contribute to a defined contribution plan for the affected union employees. Ratification of the CBAs led to $6.7 million in MEPP withdrawal charges during fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2009, the Company incurred $2.0 million in MEPP withdrawal charges.
Cost Reduction and Operating Efficiency Initiatives In response to the economic downturn, the Company reacted quickly and effectively to mitigate the impact of declining sales. Between December 2008 and September 2009, the Company fully implemented $57 million of annualized expense reductions, which were in addition to $10 million of annualized savings in fiscal 2010 from ongoing efficiency initiatives.
Financing and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt In September2009, the Company issued $400 million of 4.50% senior notes due September15, 2014 (the 2014 Notes). Additionally, in March 2010, the Company issued $300 million of 2.85% senior notes due October1, 2013 (the 2013 Notes). The net proceeds from both offerings were used to repay debt under the Companys Prior Credit Facility. Additionally, in March 2010, the Company signed a two year, $295 million securitization agreement replacing the previous $345 million agreement that was expiring.
In October2009, the Company redeemed in full its $150 million 2004 Notes at a premium of 103.125% of the principal amount with borrowings under the Companys Prior Credit Facility. In conjunction with the redemption of the 2004 Notes, the Company recognized a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $6.1million. Also during fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased $154 million of its 2018 Notes at an average price of 106.4%. In conjunction with the repurchase of the 2008 Notes, the Company recognized losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $11.8 million. As a result of the redemption of the 2004 Notes and the repurchases of the 2018 Notes, the Company recognized total losses on the early debt extinguishment of $17.9 million. The losses reflected the redemption premiums as well as writing-off the associated unamortized debt issuance costs.
25 Table of Contents INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY  Fiscal Year Ended March31, 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March31, 2009 Net Sales Net sales decreased 11% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 driven by a same-store sales decline of 14% partially offset by incremental sales of 3% contributed by acquisitions. Gas and rent same-store sales declined 10% and hardgoods same-store sales declined 20%. Same-store sales were driven by volume declines of 13% and a 1% price decline. Strategic products account for about 40% of revenues. In the aggregate, strategic products declined 6% on a same-store sales basis in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 with growth in medical gases offset by declines in all other strategic product categories.
Net Sales Year Ended March 31, 2010 2009 Decrease (In thousands) Distribution $ 3,478,475 $ 3,930,400 $ (451,925 ) -11 % All Other Operations 420,941 457,329 (36,388 ) -8 % Intercompany eliminations (24,263 ) (26,250 ) 1,987 $ 3,875,153 $ 4,361,479 $ (486,326 ) -11 % Distribution business segment sales decreased 11% compared to fiscal 2009 with a decline in same-store sales of 12%, slightly offset by incremental sales of 1% contributed by fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 acquisitions. The Distribution business segments gas and rent same-store sales declined 8% driven entirely by volumes. Hardgoods same-store sales declined 20% driven by volume declines of 19% and a 1% pricing decline. Hardgoods as well as gas and rent volumes were negatively impacted by the general slowdown in economic activity and customers delaying or deferring capital projects.
Sales of strategic gas products sold through the Distribution business segment declined 4%. Among strategic gas products, bulk gas sales were down 5% due to the impact of production slowdowns in the metal fabrication and steel customer segments, as well as reduced activity from oil field service customers. The decline in bulk gas sales related to these customer segments was partially offset by growth in sales of bulk nitrogen for food-freezing applications. Sales of medical gases grew 2% as a result of new business signings, which were partially offset by slowing in overall demand for medical gases used in elective and non-critical medical procedures. Specialty gas sales declined 9% as a result of a general softening in demand in the chemicals processing industry as well as strong sales of high-value rare gases in fiscal 2009.
Sales of core industrial gases, which experienced the sharpest volume declines, were down 15% for fiscal 2010, while the related rental revenues were down only 4%. However, revenues from the Companys rental welder business experienced a 21% decline in same-store sales as compared to fiscal 2009.
Distribution hardgoods same-store sales declined 20% driven by volume declines of 19% and a 1% pricing decline.Sales of safety products decreased 9% in fiscal 2010 resulting from plant shutdowns, shift reductions and relatively high unemployment levels. The Companys Radnor  private label line was down 16% for fiscal 2010 driven by the overall drop in hardgoods volumes.
The All Other Operations business segment sales decreased 8% compared to fiscal 2009 with a 17% decline in same-store sales offset by incremental sales of 9% contributed by acquisitions, primarily the fiscal 2009 acquisition related to the refrigerants business. The decline in same-store sales reflects lower pricing for ammonia products, a decline in carbon dioxide and dry ice volumes, and reduced refrigerant volumes. After a significant run-up in the costs of ammonia products in the first half of fiscal 2009, ammonia costs from suppliers suddenly dropped in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, while pricing to customers initially remained stable. Progressing through fiscal 2010, pricing to customers has been under increasing pressure contributing to the same-store sales decline, while the cost of ammonia from suppliers has been rising. Reduced carbon dioxide volumes reflect weakness in the beverage carbonation customer segment. Dry ice volumes were impacted by a decline in the airline services customer segment and strong fiscal 2009 sales during the second quarter in the wake of major hurricanes. Refrigerants volume declined primarily due to mild summer weather in the eastern U.S. along with customers deferral of HVAC maintenance and conversion projects in light of the economic downturn.
Gross Profits (Excluding Depreciation) Consolidated gross profits (excluding depreciation) decreased 8% principally due to a same-store sales decline offset by an expansion of gross profit margins (excluding depreciation). The consolidated gross margin (excluding depreciation) in fiscal 2010 increased 220 basis points to 55.4% compared to 53.2% in fiscal 2009 primarily driven by margin expansion in the Distribution business segment resulting from a favorable shift in sales mix.
26 Table of Contents Gross Profits (Excluding Depreciation) Year Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2010 2009 Decrease Distribution $ 1,948,868 $ 2,122,407 $ (173,539 ) -8 % All Other Operations 198,419 199,184 (765 ) 0 % $ 2,147,287 $ 2,321,591 $ (174,304 ) -8 % The Distribution business segments gross profits (excluding depreciation) decreased 8% compared to fiscal 2009.The Distribution business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was 56.0% versus 54.0% in fiscal 2009.The 200 basis point increase in the gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) largely reflects the favorable shift in product mix toward gas and rent, which carry higher gross profit margins (excluding depreciation) than hardgoods. As a percentage of the Distribution business segments sales, gas and rent increased to 60.8% in fiscal 2010 as compared to 57.2% in fiscal 2009.
The All Other Operations business segments gross profits (excluding depreciation) were consistent with fiscal 2009 as a result of lower same-store sales offset by acquisitions (primarily the fiscal 2009 acquisition in the refrigerants business) and margin expansion in the ammonia business. The All Other Operations business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) increased 350 basis points to 47.1% versus 43.6% in fiscal 2009. The year-over-year improvement in the All Other Operations business segments gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was driven by the margin improvement in the ammonia business. The improved ammonia margin reflects the impact of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 drop in the cost of ammonia and a lag in a corresponding drop in the selling price to customers. Throughout fiscal 2010, ammonia margins declined as customer pricing fell in line with product costs. Product mix also contributed to the margin improvement.
Operating Expenses SD&A expenses declined $87 million (5%)as compared to fiscal 2009 resulting from a $120 million decline in operating costs partially offset by approximately $33 million of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses. The $120 million decrease in operating costs reflects lower variable costs due to the decline in sales and the benefits from the Companys cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives. Also included in the fiscal 2010 SD&A expenses are $7.4 million in SAP implementation costs and $6.7 million related to withdrawals from MEPPs, which were not allocated to the business segments and are included within the other line item in the table below. Fiscal 2009 SD&A expenses included $5.8 million in SAP implementation costs and $2.0 million related to withdrawals from MEPPs. As a percentage of net sales, SD&A expense increased 230 basis points to 38.4% compared to 36.1% in fiscal 2009 reflecting the overall decline in sales and the shift in sales mix to gas and rent, which carry higher operating expenses in relation to sales and corresponding higher gross margins.
SD&A Expenses Year Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2010 2009 Increase/(Decrease) Distribution $ 1,348,022 $ 1,441,932 $ (93,910 ) -7 % All Other Operations 127,250 126,149 1,101 1 % Other 14,033 7,847 6,186 $ 1,489,305 $ 1,575,928 $ (86,623 ) -5 % During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company incurred $23.4 million of legal and professional fees in response to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and accompanying litigation, which principally represented up-front accruals for the minimum obligations to the Companys advisors.
Depreciation expense of $213 million increased $15 million (7%)as compared to fiscal 2009.Acquired businesses added approximately $2 million to depreciation expense.The remaining increase primarily reflected the two new air separation units in New Carlisle, Indiana and Carrollton, Kentucky, which came on-line in late fiscal 2009 and early fiscal 2010, respectively. Depreciation expense for fiscal 2010 also reflects capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand, such as cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welders, and infrastructure spending on cylinder fill plants and branch locations.Amortization expense of $22 million was $1 million (2%)lower than fiscal 2009 primarily due to lower amortization of acquired customer lists and non-compete agreements due to reduced acquisition activity.
27 Table of Contents Operating Income Consolidated operating income of $400 million decreased 24% in fiscal 2010 on lower sales and charges of $23.4 million related to the unsolicited takeover attempt, $6.7 million in MEPP withdrawal charges and costs of $7.4 million associated with the Companys SAP implementation, all of which were partially offset by gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) expansion and the benefits from the Companys cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives. In fiscal 2009, the Company recognized $2.0 million of MEPP withdrawal charges and $5.8 million in costs related to the SAP implementation. The operating income margin decreased 170 basis points to 10.3% compared to 12.0% in fiscal 2009; of the decline, 80 basis points was the result of the costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt and MEPP withdrawal charges.
Operating Income Year Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2010 2009 Decrease Distribution $ 384,584 $ 477,217 $ (92,633 ) -19 % All Other Operations 52,482 55,498 (3,016 ) -5 % Other (37,468 ) (7,847 ) (29,621 ) $ 399,598 $ 524,868 $ (125,270 ) -24 % Operating income in the Distribution business segment decreased 19% in fiscal 2010.The Distribution business segments operating income margin decreased 100 basis points to 11.1% compared to 12.1% in fiscal 2009.The operating income margin decline was driven primarily by lower sales and was partially offset by favorable mix-driven gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) expansion and the Companys cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives that were implemented in response to the economic downturn.
Operating income in the All Other Operations business segment decreased 5% compared to fiscal 2009 mainly as a result of lower same-store sales partially offset by acquisition growth (primarily the fiscal 2009 acquisition in the refrigerants business).The business segments operating income margin of 12.5% was 40 basis points higher than the operating income margin of 12.1% in fiscal 2009. The increase in operating income margin was driven principally by gross margin expansion in the ammonia business.
Interest Expense, Net, and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables totaled $69 million representing a decrease of $26 million, or 28%, compared to fiscal 2009.The decrease resulted from lower weighted-average interest rates related to the Companys variable rate debt instruments, the Companys redemption of higher interest rate notes, as well as lower average debt levels from the pay down during fiscal 2010 of approximately $268 million of debt and borrowings under the trade receivables securitization.
The discount on the securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the proceeds from their sale.The amount of the discount varies on a monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates.
Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt During fiscal 2010, the Company redeemed in full the $150 million of 2004 Notes at a price of 103.125% of the principal amount. Additionally, the Company repurchased approximately $154 million of its 2018 Notes at an average price of 106.4%. In conjunction with these transactions, the Company recognized losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million. The losses related to the redemption premiums and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.
Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate in fiscal 2010 was 37.5% of pre-tax earnings compared to 39.2% in fiscal 2009. The lower tax rate for fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of tax benefits of $2.2 million associated with the reorganization of certain facilities within the All Other Operations business segment and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions.
28 Table of Contents Net Earnings Net earnings were $196 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, compared to $261 million, or $3.12 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009. Net earnings for fiscal 2010 include costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt of $23.4 million ($14.8 million after tax) or $0.18 per diluted share, losses related to the early extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million ($11.3 million after tax) or $0.14 per diluted share and charges related to withdrawals from MEPPs of $6.7 million ($4.1 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share, slightly offset by an income tax benefit of $2.2 million or $0.03 per diluted share.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $275 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $600 million in fiscal 2010 and $583 million in fiscal 2009. The reduction in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2011 was principally driven by the new accounting treatment for the Companys Securitization Agreement, which resulted in a $295 million use of cash in operating activities and a corresponding source of cash in financing activities in the current year. On April1, 2010, the Company adopted new accounting guidance which affected the presentation of its trade receivables securitization program. Under the new guidance, proceeds received under the securitization are treated as secured borrowings, which are classified as a financing activity on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, whereas previously they were treated as proceeds from the sale of trade receivables, which were classified as an operating activity on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Furthermore, the new accounting treatment resulted in the recognition of both the trade receivables securitized under the program and the borrowings they collateralize on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet, which led to a $295 million increase in trade receivables and long-term debt as of April1, 2010. Accordingly, $295 million in new borrowings under the Securitization Agreement were classified as sources of cash under financing activities on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Prior to April1, 2010, these borrowings were treated as proceeds from the sale of trade receivables and reflected net of collections on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as operating activities. Additionally, the $295 million increase in trade receivables was classified as a use of cash from operating activities.
The Companys underlying business activities generated strong operating cash flows during fiscal 2011. Net earnings adjusted for non-cash and non-operating items provided cash of $598 million in fiscal 2011 versus $541 million in fiscal 2010 and $605 million in fiscal 2009. Adjusted cash from operations * , which essentially removes the impact of the fiscal 2011 change in accounting principle noted above and cash expenditures related to the Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 from the Companys net cash provided by operating activities, was $617 million in the current year as compared to $648 million in the prior year. The fiscal 2011 decline in the adjusted cash from operations * reflected higher working capital requirements as a result of improving sales. Improving sales drove higher trade receivable and inventory levels as trade receivable collection rates and Days Sales Outstanding metrics improved slightly year over year, while inventory turns remained relatively consistent for both the current and prior year. Likewise, free cash flow * of $387 million in the current year decreased from $412 million in the prior year for principally the same reasons.
Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 totaled $262 million and primarily consisted of cash used for capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were 6.0% of sales in fiscal 2011 as compared to 6.5% of sales in fiscal 2010 and 8.1% in fiscal 2009. Capital expenditures in all three fiscal years reflected investments in revenue generating equipment, such as cylinders and bulk tanks, as well as the development of the Companys highly customized SAP system. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 also reflected the completion of major capital projects, such as the New Carlisle, Indiana air separation unit and the carbon dioxide plant in Deer Park, Texas. Capital spending in fiscal 2010 reflected the completion of the Carrollton, Kentucky air separation unit. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 are expected to remain at approximately 6.0% of sales. Cash used in investing activities decreased $61 million from fiscal 2010 and $348 million from fiscal 2009 as a result of lower capital expenditures and fewer acquisition-related activities. During fiscal 2011, the Company paid $21 million to acquire eight businesses and settle holdback liabilities. The largest of the businesses acquired was Conley Gas, Ltd., a supplier of pure gases to the specialty gas industry, with historical annual sales of approximately $9 million. In fiscal 2010, the Company made acquisition-related cash payments of $81 million primarily associated with the purchase of six businesses, the largest of which was Tri-Tech, a Florida-based industrial gas and welding supply distributor with approximately $31 million in historical annual sales. During fiscal 2009, the Company paid $274 million to acquire 14 businesses, the largest of which was Refron, Inc., a distributor of refrigerant gases with historical annual sales of $93 million, and to settle acquisition holdback liabilities.
29 Table of Contents Financing activities used cash of $3 million in fiscal 2011 and $278 million in fiscal 2010. Financing activities provided cash of $31 million in fiscal 2009. As noted in the Financial Instruments section below, during fiscal 2011, the Company engaged in refinancing activities, which extended its average debt maturity to 3.6 years at March31, 2011. In addition to refinancing its Prior Credit Facility, the Company also issued $250 million of 3.25% senior notes during fiscal 2011. The Company also authorized and completed a share repurchase plan in its fiscal fourth quarter, purchasing 4.8million shares of treasury stock for $300 million. The treasury stock purchases were financed under the Credit Facility. The change in accounting principle for the Securitization Agreement noted above was reflected in proceeds from borrowings, but had no impact on the Companys net cash position. Absent the change in accounting principle, the Company borrowed a net $36 million during fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2010, the Company redeemed in full its $150 million 6.25% senior notes and purchased a significant portion of its 7.125% senior subordinated notes. Also in fiscal 2010, the Company issued $400 million of 4.5% senior notes and $300 million of 2.85% senior notes, using the net proceeds from both offerings to pay down its Prior Credit Facility. The Company repaid a net $254 million of debt during fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2009, the Company issued $400 million of 7.125% senior subordinated notes using the proceeds to pay down its Prior Credit Facility. The Company also purchased 2.4million treasury shares for $120 million and completed a share repurchase plan in fiscal 2009. The Company also increased its per share dividend payouts to stockholders by 33% in fiscal 2011 and by 36% in fiscal 2010.
Dividends The Company paid its stockholders quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share at the end of the first quarter and $0.25 per share at end of the second and third quarters of fiscal 2011. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company paid dividends of $0.29 per share. On May17, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.29 per share, which is payable on June30, 2011 to the stockholders of record as of June15, 2011. During fiscal 2010, the Company paid regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.18 per share at the end of each of the first three quarters and $0.22 in the fourth quarter. During fiscal 2009, the Company paid regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.12 per share at the end of each of the first two quarters and $0.16 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors.
Financial Instruments Senior Subordinated Note Redemption During fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased $30 million of its 2018 Notes at an average price of 110.6%. Losses on the early extinguishment of the 2018 Notes were $3.6 million for the year ended March31, 2011 and related to the redemption premiums and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. During fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased $155 million of its 2018 Notes and redeemed in full the $150 million of 2004 Notes. The Company recognized losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17.9 million in fiscal 2010. The losses related to the redemption premiums and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.
Senior Credit Facility On September13, 2010, the Company entered into its new four-year $750 million Credit Facility. The Credit Facility consists of a $650 million U.S. dollar revolving credit line and a $100 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) multi-currency revolving credit line. The maturity date of the revolving credit lines is September13, 2014. Under circumstances described in the Credit Facility, the revolving credit line may be increased by an additional $325 million, provided that the multi-currency revolving credit line may not be increased by more than an additional $50 million.
In connection with the entry by the Company into the Credit Facility, on September13, 2010, the Company terminated its Prior Credit Facility, a senior credit facility with an aggregate commitment of $1.7 billion. All obligations under the Prior Credit Facility (including the term loans) were repaid in full using proceeds of the Credit Facility and other funds. As a result of the termination of the Prior Credit Facility, the Company recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million for the year ended March31, 2011 related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.
As of March31, 2011, the Company had $374 million of borrowings under the Credit Facility, including $331 million under the U.S. dollar revolver and $43 million under the multi-currency revolver. The Company also had outstanding letters of credit of $41 million issued under the Credit Facility. The U.S. dollar revolver borrowings bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 212.5 basis points. The multi-currency revolver bears interest based on a spread of 212.5 basis points over the Euro currency rate applicable to each foreign currency borrowing. As of March31, 2011, the average effective interest rates on the U.S. dollar revolver and the multi-currency revolver were 2.31% and 2.87%, respectively.
30 Table of Contents The Company also maintains a committed revolving line of credit of up to 5.0million (U.S. $7.1 million) to fund its expansion into France. These revolving credit borrowings are outside of the Companys Credit Facility. At March31, 2011, French revolving credit borrowings were 2.9million (U.S. $4.1 million). The variable interest rates on the French revolving credit borrowings are based on the Euro currency rate plus 212.5 basis points. As of March31, 2011, the effective interest rate on the French revolving credit borrowings was 2.98%. The French revolving line of credit was amended in February 2011 to extend the maturity date to December31, 2011 and increase the borrowing capacity.
At March31, 2011, the Credit Facilitys financial covenant did not restrict the Companys ability to borrow on the unused portion of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including nonpayment and breach of covenants. In the event of default, repayment of borrowings under the Credit Facility may be accelerated. The Companys Credit Facility also contains cross-default provisions whereby a default under the Credit Facility could result in defaults under the senior and senior subordinated notes discussed below.
Total Borrowing Capacity As of March31, 2011, $335 million remained unused under the Companys Credit Facility. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity from cash from operations and under its revolving credit facilities to meet its working capital, capital expenditure and other financial commitments. The financial covenant under the Companys Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a leverage ratio not higher than 3.5. The leverage ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting debt and, historically, the amounts outstanding under the Securitization Agreement divided by a contractually defined Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for the trailing twelve-month period with pro forma adjustments for acquisitions. The financial covenant calculations of the Credit Facility include the pro forma results of acquired businesses. Therefore, total borrowing capacity is not reduced dollar-for-dollar with acquisition financing. The leverage ratio measures the Companys ability to meet current and future obligations. At March31, 2011, the Companys leverage ratio was 2.4.
The Company continually evaluates alternative financing and believes that it can obtain financing on reasonable terms. The terms of any future financing arrangements depend on market conditions and the Companys financial position at that time.
Money Market Loans The Company has an agreement with a financial institution that provides access to short-term advances not to exceed $35 million. The agreement expires on December1, 2011, but may be extended subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. The advances are generally overnight or for up to seven days. The amount, term and interest rate of an advance are established through mutual agreement with the financial institution when the Company requests such an advance. At March31, 2011, there were no advances outstanding under the agreement.
The Company also has an agreement with another financial institution that provides access to additional short-term advances not to exceed $35 million. The advances may be for one to six months with rates at a fixed spread over the corresponding LIBOR. At March31, 2011, there were no advances outstanding under the agreement.
Senior Notes On September30, 2010, the Company issued $250 million of 3.25% senior notes due October1, 2015 (the 2015 Notes). The 2015 Notes were issued at a discount and yield 3.283%. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2015 Notes were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit line under the Credit Facility. Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semi-annually on April1 and October1 of each year. Additionally, the Company has the option to redeem the 2015 Notes prior to their maturity, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest and applicable make-whole payments.
At March31, 2011, the Company had $400 million outstanding of the 2014 Notes. The 2014 Notes were issued at a discount and yield 4.527%. Interest on the 2014 Notes is payable semi-annually on March15 and September15 of each year. Additionally, the Company has the option to redeem the 2014 Notes prior to their maturity, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest and applicable make-whole payments.
At March31, 2011, the Company had $300 million outstanding of the 2013 Notes. The 2013 Notes were issued at a discount and yield 2.871%. Interest on the 2013 Notes is payable semi-annually on April1 and October1 of each year. Additionally, the Company has the option to redeem the 2013 Notes prior to their maturity, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest and applicable make-whole payments.
The 2013, 2014 and 2015 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the incurrence of liens and limit sale and leaseback transactions.
31 Table of Contents Senior Subordinated Notes At March31, 2011, the Company had $215 million of its 2018 Notes outstanding. The 2018 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 7.125%, payable semi-annually on October1 and April1 of each year. The 2018 Notes have a redemption provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2018 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is October1, 2013 at a price of 103.563% of the principal amount.
During the year ended March31, 2011, the Company incurred a one-time interest penalty payable to holders of the 2018 Notes in the amount of $2.6 million related to the late removal of the restrictive legend on these notes. The Company has classified these charges as interest expense.
The 2018 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the payment of dividends, the repurchase of common stock, the issuance of preferred stock, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens.
Acquisition and Other Notes The Companys long-term debt also includes acquisition and other notes, principally consisting of notes issued to sellers of businesses acquired, which are repayable in periodic installments. At March31, 2011, acquisition and other notes totaled $9.9 million with an average interest rate of approximately 6% and an average maturity of approximately one year.
Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in the Securitization Agreement with three commercial banks to which it sells qualifying trade receivables on a revolving basis.Effective April1, 2010 under new accounting guidance, the Companys sale of qualified trade receivable is now accounted for as a secured borrowing under which qualified trade receivables collateralize amounts borrowed from the commercial banks. Trade receivables that collateralize the Securitization Agreement are held in a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity, which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Qualified trade receivables in the amount of the outstanding borrowing under the Securitization Agreement are not available to the general creditors of the Company. The maximum amount of the Securitization Agreement is $295 million and it bears interest at approximately LIBOR plus 80 basis points. At March31, 2011, the amount of outstanding borrowing under the Securitization Agreement has been classified as long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts borrowed under the Securitization Agreement could fluctuate monthly based on the Companys funding requirements and the level of qualified trade receivables available to collateralize the Securitization Agreement. The Securitization Agreement expires in March 2013 and contains customary events of termination, including standard cross default provisions with respect to outstanding debt. The amount of outstanding borrowing under the Securitization Agreement at March31, 2011 was $295 million.
Interest Rate Derivatives The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The Companys involvement with derivative instruments is limited to a) highly effective interest rate swap agreements used to manage well-defined interest rate risk exposures and b) treasury rate lock agreements used to fix the interest rate related to forecasted debt issuances. The Company monitors its positions and credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties. Interest rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements are not entered into for trading purposes. The Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At March31, 2011, the Company was party to a total of five interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million.
The Company designates fixed interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges of interest payments on variable-rate debt associated with the Companys Securitization Agreement. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings.
During fiscal 2011, fixed interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $250 million matured and at March31, 2011, the Company was not party to any fixed interest rate swap agreements.
32 Table of Contents For the year ended March31, 2011, the fair value of the liability for the fixed interest rate swap agreements decreased and the Company recorded a corresponding adjustment to AOCI of $4.0 million, or $2.7 million after tax. For the year ended March31, 2010, the fair value of the liability for the fixed interest rate swap agreements decreased and the Company recorded a corresponding adjustment to AOCI of $8.6 million, or $5.6 million after tax. The amount of gain or loss recorded in earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness related to the designated cash flow hedges was immaterial for the years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
In anticipation of the issuance of the 2015 Notes, the Company entered into a treasury rate lock agreement in July 2010, with a notional amount of $100 million, maturing on September8, 2010. The treasury rate lock agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge of the semi-annual interest payments associated with the forecasted issuance of the 2015 Notes. When the treasury rate lock agreement matured, the Company incurred a loss of $2.6 million ($1.6 million after tax) which is reported as a component of AOCI and will be reclassified into earnings over the term of the 2015 Notes. For the year ended March31, 2011, $258 thousand of the loss on the treasury rate lock was reclassified to interest expense. At March31, 2011, the estimated loss recorded in AOCI on the treasury rate lock agreement that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is $326 thousand, net of tax.
The Company also has variable interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.
At March31, 2011, the Company had five variable interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional amount of $300 million. These variable interest rate swaps effectively convert the Companys $300 million of fixed rate 2013 Notes to variable rate debt. At March31, 2011, these swap agreements required the Company to make variable interest payments based on a weighted average forward rate of 2.17% and receive fixed interest payments from the counterparties based on a fixed rate of 2.85%. The maturity of these fair value swaps coincides with the maturity date of the Companys 2013 Notes in October 2013. During the year ended March31, 2011, the fair value of the variable interest rate swaps increased by $5.7 million to an asset of $5.1 million and was recorded in other non-current assets. The corresponding increase in the carrying value of the 2013 Notes caused by the hedged risk was $5.6 million and was recorded in long-term debt. The Company records the gain or loss on the hedged item (i.e., the 2013 Notes) and the gain or loss on the variable interest rate swaps in interest expense. The net gain or loss recorded in earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness related to the designated fair value hedges was immaterial for the years ended March31, 2011 and 2010.
The Company measures the fair value of its interest rate swaps using observable market rates to calculate the forward yield curves used to determine expected cash flows for each interest rate swap agreement. The discounted present values of the expected cash flows are calculated using the same forward yield curve. The discount rate assumed in the fair value calculations is adjusted for non-performance risk, dependent on the classification of the interest rate swap as an asset or liability. If an interest rate swap is a liability, the Company assesses the credit and non-performance risk of Airgas by determining an appropriate credit spread for entities with similar credit characteristics as the Company. If, however, an interest rate swap is in an asset position, a credit analysis of counterparties is performed assessing the credit and non-performance risk based upon the pricing history of counterparty specific credit default swaps or credit spreads for entities with similar credit ratings to the counterparties. The Company does not believe it is at risk for non-performance by its counterparties. However, if an interest rate swap is in an asset position, the failure of one or more of its counterparties would result in an increase in interest expense and a reduction of earnings. The Company compares its fair value calculations to the fair values calculated by the counterparties for each swap agreement for reasonableness.
OTHER Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the net carrying value of trade receivables, inventories, goodwill, other intangible assets, business insurance reserves and deferred income tax assets. Uncertainties about future events make these estimates susceptible to change. Management evaluates these estimates regularly and believes they are the best estimates, appropriately made, given the known facts and circumstances. For the three years ended March31, 2011, there were no material changes in the valuation methods or assumptions used by management. However, actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. The Company believes the following accounting estimates are critical due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for these matters, their susceptibility to change and the potential impact that different assumptions could have on operating performance.
33 Table of Contents Trade Receivables The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes sales returns, sales allowances and bad debts. The allowance adjusts the carrying value of trade receivables to fair value based on estimates of accounts that will not ultimately be collected. An allowance for doubtful accounts is generally established as trade receivables age beyond their due dates. As past due balances age, higher valuation allowances are established lowering the net carrying value of receivables. The amount of valuation allowance established for each past due period reflects the Companys historical collections experience and current economic conditions and trends. The Company also establishes valuation allowances for specific problem accounts and bankruptcies. The amounts ultimately collected on past due trade receivables are subject to numerous factors including general economic conditions, the condition of the receivable portfolio assumed in acquisitions, the financial condition of individual customers, and the terms of reorganization for accounts emerging from bankruptcy. Changes in these conditions impact the Companys collection experience and may result in the recognition of higher or lower valuation allowances. Management evaluates the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Historically, bad debt expense reflected in the Companys financial results has generally been in the range of 0.3% to 0.5% of sales. The Company has a low concentration of credit risk due to its broad and diversified customer base across multiple industries and geographic locations, and its relatively low average order size. The Companys largest customer accounts for approximately 0.5% of total net sales.
Inventories The Companys inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The majority of the products the Company carries in inventory have long shelf lives and are not subject to technological obsolescence. The Company writes its inventory down to its estimated market value when it believes the market value is below cost. The Company estimates its ability to recover the costs of items in inventory by product type based on its age, the rate at which that product line is turning in inventory, its physical condition as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The ability of the Company to recover its cost for products in inventory can be affected by factors such as future customer demand, general market conditions and the relationship with significant suppliers. Management evaluates the recoverability of its inventory at least quarterly. In aggregate, inventory turns four to five times per year.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that they may be impaired. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of October31 of each year.
The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process. The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of its reporting units. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margins, future capital expenditures, working capital needs, discount rates, perpetual growth rates, etc. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated potential impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated in step one, is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying value. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is not permitted.
The discount rate, sales growth and profitability assumptions and perpetual growth rate are the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. The Companys discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a peer group of companies in the chemical manufacturing industry with an equity size premium added, as applicable, for each reporting unit. The WACC is calculated based on observable market data. Some of this data (such as the risk free or treasury rate and the pretax cost of debt) are based on market data at a point in time. Other data (such as beta and the equity risk premium) are based upon market data over time.
34 Table of Contents The discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. The Companys analysis uses internally generated budgets and long-range forecasts. The Companys discounted cash flow analysis uses the assumptions in these budgets and forecasts about sales trends, inflation, working capital needs and forecasted capital expenditures along with an estimate of the reporting units terminal value (the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period) to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit. The Companys assumptions about working capital needs and capital expenditures are based on historical experience. The perpetual growth rate assumed in the discounted cash flow model was in line with the long-term growth rate as measured by the U.S. Gross Domestic Product and the industrys long-term rate of growth.
The Company believes the assumptions used in its discounted cash flow analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit. However, the Company may not meet its sales growth and profitability targets, working capital needs and capital expenditures may be higher than forecast, changes in credit markets may result in changes to the Companys discount rate and general business conditions may result in changes to the Companys terminal value assumptions for its reporting units. The Companys October31, 2010 annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial amount. Furthermore, a hypothetical 10% reduction in the fair value of each reporting unit would not indicate that goodwill associated with any reporting unit was potentially impaired.
Business Insurance Reserves The Company has established insurance programs to cover workers compensation, business automobile and general liability claims. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, these programs had high deductible limits of $1 million per occurrence. For fiscal 2012, the high deductible limits will remain $1 million per occurrence. The Company reserves for its self-insured retention based on individual claim evaluations establishing loss estimates for known claims based on the current facts and circumstances. These known claims are then developed through actuarial computations, to reflect the expected ultimate loss for the known claims, as well as incurred but not reported claims. Actuarial computations use the Companys specific loss history, payment patterns and insurance coverage, plus industry trends and other factors to estimate the required reserve for all open claims by policy year and loss type. Reserves for the Companys self-insurance retention are evaluated monthly. Semi-annually, the Company obtains a third-party actuarial report to validate that the computations and assumptions used are consistent with actuarial standards. Certain assumptions used in the actuarial computations are susceptible to change. Loss development factors are influenced by items such as medical inflation, changes in workers compensation laws, and changes in the Companys loss payment patterns, all of which can have a significant influence on the estimated ultimate loss related to the Companys self-insured retention. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of open claims may be for amounts more or less than the reserve balances. The Companys operations are spread across a significant number of locations, which helps to mitigate the potential impact of any given event that could give rise to an insurance-related loss. Over the last three years, business insurance expense has generally been in the range of 0.6% to 0.8% of sales.
Income Taxes At March31, 2011, the Company had deferred tax assets of $109.2 million (net of valuation allowances of $9.4 million), deferred tax liabilities of $782.0 million and a net $9.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
The Company estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the Company conducts business. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes. The Company evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character (e.g., capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred income tax assets to their realizable value when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences and carryforward deferred tax assets become deductible or utilized. Management considers the reversal of taxable temporary differences and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. As events and circumstances change, related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets reverse, at March31, 2011 management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances.
Unrecognized tax benefits represent income tax positions taken on income tax returns that have not been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Companys tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the Companys tax positions. The Companys practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions, including interest and penalties when applicable. The Company does not anticipate significant changes in the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits over the next year.

(1) Aggregate long-term debt instruments are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March31, 2011. Long-term debt includes capital lease obligations, which were not material and, therefore, did not warrant separate disclosure.
(2) The future interest payments on the Companys long-term debt obligations were estimated based on the current outstanding principal reduced by scheduled maturities in each period presented and interest rates as of March31, 2011. The actual interest payments may differ materially from those presented above based on actual amounts of long-term debt outstanding and actual interest rates in future periods.
(3) Receipts under interest rate swap agreements result from changes in market interest rates compared to contractual rates and payments to be exchanged between the parties to the agreements. The estimated receipts in future periods were determined based on forward LIBOR rates as of March31, 2011. Actual receipts may differ materially from those presented above based on actual interest rates in future periods.
(4) Non-compete agreements are obligations of the Company to make scheduled future payments, generally to former owners of acquired businesses, contingent upon their compliance with the covenants of the non-compete agreement.
(5) Letters of credit are guarantees of payment to third parties. The Companys letters of credit principally back obligations associated with the Companys self-insured retention on workers compensation, business automobile and general liability claims. The letters of credit are supported by the Companys Credit Facility.
(6) The Companys operating leases at March31, 2011 include approximately $183 million in fleet vehicles under long-term operating leases. The Company guarantees a residual value of $27 million related to its leased vehicles.
(7) In addition to the gas volumes supplied by Airgas Merchant Gases, the Company purchases industrial, medical and specialty gases pursuant to requirements contracts from national and regional producers of industrial gases. The Company has a long-term take-or-pay supply agreement, in effect through August31, 2017, with Air Products to supply the Company with bulk liquid nitrogen, oxygen and argon. Additionally, the Company purchases helium gas from Air Products under long-term supply agreements. Based on the volume of fiscal 2011 purchases, the Air Products supply agreements represent approximately $53 million annually in liquid bulk gas purchases.
The Company also has long-term take-or-pay supply agreements with Linde AG to purchase oxygen, nitrogen, argon and, helium. The agreements expire at various dates through July 2019 and represent approximately $49 million in annual bulk gas purchases. Additionally, the Company has long-term take-or-pay supply agreements to purchase oxygen, nitrogen and argon from other major producers. Annual purchases under these contracts are approximately $14 million and they expire at various dates through June 2024.
36 Table of Contents The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2011 purchases. The supply agreements noted above contain periodic adjustments based on certain economic indices and market analysis. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions.
(8) The Company is a party to long-term take-or-pay supply agreements for the purchase of liquid carbon dioxide with approximately 15 suppliers that expire at various dates through 2044. The purchase commitments for future periods contained in the table above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2011 purchases. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the carbon dioxide supply agreements could differ materially from those presented in the table due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. Certain of the liquid carbon dioxide supply agreements contain market pricing subject to certain economic indices.
(9) The Company purchases ammonia from a variety of sources and is obligated to purchase approximately $3.1 million annually under these contracts.

Non-GAAP numbers should be read in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, as non-GAAP metrics are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our free cash flow and adjusted cash from operations metrics may be different from free cash flow and adjusted cash from operations metrics provided by other companies.
37 Table of Contents Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No.2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13), which addresses the allocation of revenue in arrangements containing multiple deliverables. Specifically, ASU 2009-13 modifies existing GAAP by providing new guidance concerning (1)the determination of whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting, and (2)the manner in which arrangement consideration should be allocated to such deliverables. The guidance requires the use of an entitys best estimate of the selling price of a deliverable if vendor specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of the selling price cannot be determined. Additionally, ASU 2009-13 eliminates the use of the residual method of allocating consideration when vendor specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of the selling price is known for some, but not all, of the delivered items in a multiple element arrangement. Finally, ASU 2009-13 requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures in the financial statements. ASU 2009-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance may be applied either prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year for new or materially modified arrangements, or it may be applied retrospectively. The Company currently has contracts in place that contain multiple deliverables, principally product supply agreements for gases and container rental. The Company treats the deliverables in these arrangements under current GAAP as separate units of accounting with selling prices derived from Company specific or third-party evidence. The Company adopted the new guidance, prospectively, on April1, 2011. The new guidance is not expected to significantly modify the accounting for these types of arrangements.
In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No.2010-28, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2010-28), which provides additional guidance on when Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test must be performed. The guidance clarifies that for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts, Step 2 must be performed if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists based on the evaluation of certain qualitative factors. ASU 2010-28 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December15, 2010, with early adoption prohibited. The Company adopted the new guidance on April1, 2011 with no impact on its consolidated financial statements. Future goodwill impairment tests will follow the requirements of the new guidance.
In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No.2010-29, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2010-29), which provides clarification on disclosure requirements and amends current guidance to require entities to disclose pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the current year had been as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. Qualitative disclosures describing the nature and amount of any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combinations included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings are also required. ASU 2010-29 is effective for business combinations with acquisition dates on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2010-29 on April1, 2011. Pro forma disclosures for future acquisitions will follow the new guidance.

ITEM7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate exposure arises primarily from the interest payment terms of the Companys borrowing agreements. Interest rate derivatives are used to adjust the interest rate risk exposures that are inherent in its portfolio of funding sources. The Company also uses treasury rate lock agreements to hedge the risk associated with the interest rates paid on forecasted debt issuances. The Company has not established, and will not establish, any interest rate risk positions for purposes other than managing the risk associated with its portfolio of funding sources or anticipated funding sources. The counterparties to interest rate derivatives are major financial institutions. The Company has established counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions with long-term credit ratings of at least a single A rating by one of the major credit rating agencies. In addition, the Company monitors its position and the credit ratings of its counterparties, thereby minimizing the risk of non-performance by the counterparties.
The table below summarizes the Companys market risks associated with debt obligations, interest rate swaps and the trade receivables securitization at March31, 2011. For debt obligations and the trade receivables securitization, the table presents cash flows related to payments of principal and interest by fiscal year of maturity. For interest rate swaps, the table presents the notional amounts underlying the agreements by year of maturity. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual payments to be exchanged and are not actually paid or received. Fair values were computed using market quotes, if available, or based on discounted cash flows using market interest rates as of the end of the period.

The variable interest rates on the U.S. dollar revolving credit line are based on a spread over LIBOR applicable to each tranche under the U.S. credit line. The average of the variable interest rates on the multi-currency portions of the Credit Facility is based on a spread over the Euro currency rate applicable to each foreign currency borrowing under the multi-currency credit line. The variable interest rates on the French revolving credit borrowings are also based on a spread over the Euro currency rate.
Limitations of the Tabular Presentation As the table incorporates only those interest rate risk exposures that exist as of March31, 2011, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. In addition, actual cash flows of financial instruments in future periods may differ materially from prospective cash flows presented in the table due to future fluctuations in variable interest rates, debt levels and the Companys credit rating.
40 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Rate Risk Canadian subsidiaries and the European operations of the Company are funded with local currency debt. The Company does not otherwise hedge its exposure to translation gains and losses relating to foreign currency net asset exposures. The Company considers its exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations to be immaterial to its financial position and results of operations.

F-1 Table of Contents STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENTS FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Management of Airgas, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and related financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The consolidated financial statements reflect managements informed judgment and estimation as to the effect of events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed.
Management maintains a system of internal control, which includes internal control over financial reporting, at each business unit. The Companys system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable assurance that records are maintained in reasonable detail to properly reflect transactions and permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, that transactions are executed in accordance with managements and the Board of Directors authorization, and that unauthorized transactions are prevented or detected on a timely basis such that they could not materially affect the financial statements. The Company also maintains a staff of internal auditors who review and evaluate the system of internal control on a continual basis. In determining the extent of the system of internal control, management recognizes that the cost should not exceed the benefits derived. The evaluation of these factors requires judgment by management.
Management evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page F-4, issued their opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2011 and an opinion on the fair presentation of the financial position of the Company as of March31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of the Companys operations and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March31, 2011.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting solely of independent directors, meets regularly (jointly and separately) with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself that they are properly discharging their responsibilities. The independent registered public accounting firm has direct access to the Audit Committee.

Airgas, Inc.s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Airgas, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, Airgas, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for its trade receivable securitization agreement due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No.2009-16, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets , as of April1, 2010.

F-9 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) Description of the Business Airgas, Inc. and subsidiaries (Airgas or the Company) became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986. Since its inception, the Company has made approximately 400 acquisitions to become the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases (delivered in packaged or cylinder form), and hardgoods, such as welding equipment and supplies. Airgas is also one of the largest U.S. distributors of safety products, the largest U.S. producer of nitrous oxide and dry ice, the largest liquid carbon dioxide producer in the Southeast, the fifth largest producer of atmospheric merchant gases in North America, and a leading distributor of process chemicals, refrigerants and ammonia products. The Company markets its products to its diversified customer base through multiple sales channels including branch-based sales representatives, retail stores, strategic customer account programs, telesales, catalogs, eBusiness and independent distributors. More than 14,000 employees work in approximately 1,100 locations including branches, retail stores, packaged gas fill plants, cylinder testing facilities, specialty gas labs, production facilities and distribution centers.
(b) Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Airgas, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
The Company has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the net carrying value of trade receivables, inventories, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets, asset retirement obligations, business and health insurance reserves, loss contingencies and deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
(c) Reclassifications and Prior Period Adjustments Certain reclassifications were made to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal years 2010 and 2009, as well as the related notes, to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications resulted in increasing revenue and selling, distribution and administrative expenses and reducing cost of products sold (excluding depreciation). These reclassifications were the result of conforming the Companys accounting policies in conjunction with its implementation of a new enterprise information system (SAP) and were not material. Consolidated operating income and net earnings for the prior periods were not impacted by the reclassifications.
(d) Cash and Cash Overdraft On a daily basis, all available funds are swept from depository accounts into a concentration account and used to repay debt under the Companys revolving credit facilities. Cash principally represents the balance of customer checks that have not yet cleared through the banking system and become available to be swept into the concentration account, and deposits made subsequent to the daily cash sweep. The Company does not fund its disbursement accounts for checks it has written until the checks are presented to the bank for payment. Cash overdrafts represent the balance of outstanding checks and are classified with other current liabilities. There are no compensating balance requirements or other restrictions on the transfer of cash associated with the Companys depository accounts.
(e) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes sales returns, sales allowances and bad debts. The allowance adjusts the carrying value of trade receivables for the estimate of accounts that will ultimately not be collected. An allowance for doubtful accounts is generally established as trade receivables age beyond their due dates. As past due balances age, higher valuation allowances are established lowering the net carrying value of receivables. The amount of valuation allowance established for each past due period reflects the Companys historical collections experience and current economic conditions and trends. The Company also establishes valuation allowances for specific problem accounts and bankruptcies. The amounts ultimately collected on past due trade receivables are subject to numerous factors including general economic conditions, the condition of the receivable portfolio assumed in acquisitions, the financial condition of individual customers, and the terms of reorganization for accounts exiting bankruptcy. Changes in these conditions impact the Companys collection experience and may result in the recognition of higher or lower valuation allowances.
F-10 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (f) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, average-cost method and last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. At March31, 2011, approximately 72%, 19% and 9% of inventory was valued using the FIFO, average-cost and LIFO methods, respectively. At March31, 2010, approximately 73%, 17% and 10% of inventory was valued using the FIFO, average-cost and LIFO methods, respectively.
(g) Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment are initially stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The carrying values of long-lived assets, including plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded value cannot be recovered from the undiscounted future cash flows. When the book value of an asset exceeds the associated undiscounted expected future cash flows, it is considered to be potentially impaired and is written down to fair value, which is determined based on either discounted future cash flows or appraised values. The Company also leases property, plant and equipment, principally under operating leases. Rent expense for operating leases, which may have escalating rentals or rent holidays, is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company capitalizes the interest cost associated with the development and construction of significant new plant and equipment and depreciates that amount over the lives of the related assets. During the years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded capitalized interest for construction in progress of $2.3 million, $2.9 million and $3.4 million, respectively.
(h) Computer Software The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred to purchase or develop computer software for internal use.These costs include purchased software packages, payments to vendors and consultants for the development, implementation or modification of purchased software packages for Company use, payroll and related costs for employees associated with internal-use software projects, interest costs incurred in developing software for internal use, and software costs that allow for access or conversion of old data by new internal-use software.Capitalized computer software costs are included within plant and equipment on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the computer software, which is generally from three to ten years.
(i) Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Deferred Financing Costs Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that they may be impaired. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles impairment as of October31 of each year.
Other intangible assets primarily include non-competition agreements and customer relationships resulting from business acquisitions. Both non-competition agreements and customer relationships are recorded based on their acquisition date fair values. Non-competition agreements are amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the agreement. Customer relationships are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to 17 years. The Company assesses the recoverability of other intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of the intangible asset can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows of the related business unit.
Financing costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and included in other non-current assets. Deferred financing costs are amortized as interest expense over the term of the related debt instrument.
(j) Asset Retirement Obligations The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period when the asset is placed in service. The fair value of the liability is estimated using projected discounted cash flows. In subsequent periods, the retirement obligation is accreted to its future value, which is the estimate of the obligation at the asset retirement date. When the asset is placed in service, a corresponding retirement asset equal to the fair value of the retirement obligation is also recorded as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the assets useful life. The majority of the Companys asset retirement obligations are related to the restoration costs associated with returning bulk tank sites to their original condition upon termination of long-term leases or supply agreements. The Companys asset retirement obligations totaled $12.7 million and $11.1 million at March31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are reflected within other non-current liabilities on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.
F-11 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (k) Commitments and Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the claim, assessment or damages can be reasonably estimated.
The Company maintains business insurance programs with high deductible limits, which cover workers compensation, business automobile and general liability claims. The Company accrues estimated losses using actuarial models and assumptions based on historical loss experience. The actuarial calculations used to estimate business insurance reserves are based on numerous assumptions, some of which are subjective. The Company will adjust its business insurance reserves, if necessary, in the event future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns.
The Company maintains a self-insured health benefits plan, which provides medical benefits to employees electing coverage under the plan. The Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported medical claims and claim development. The reserve is an estimate based on historical experience and other assumptions, some of which are subjective. The Company will adjust its self-insured medical benefits reserve as the Companys loss experience changes due to medical inflation, changes in the number of plan participants and an aging employee base.
(l) Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards are expected to be recovered, settled or utilized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
The Company recognizes the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit is recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, the Company accrues interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
(m) Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys foreign operations is the applicable local currency. The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using average exchange rates during each reporting period. The gains or losses resulting from such translations are included in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as incurred.
(n) Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. Concentrations of credit risk are limited due to the Companys large number of customers and their dispersion across many industries primarily throughout North America. Credit terms granted to customers are generally net 30 days.
(o) Financial Instruments In managing interest rate risk exposure, the Company may enter into interest rate swap agreements and treasury rate lock agreements. An interest rate swap is a contractual exchange of interest payments between two parties. A standard interest rate swap involves the payment of a fixed rate times a notional amount by one party in exchange for receiving a floating rate times the same notional amount from the other party. As interest rates change, the difference to be paid or received is accrued and recognized as interest expense or income over the life of the agreement. Treasury rate lock agreements are used to fix the interest rate related to forecasted debt issuances. Interest rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements are not entered into for trading purposes. Counterparties to the Companys interest rate contracts are major financial institutions. The Company recognizes derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. The interest rate contracts are marked to market with changes in fair value recognized in either accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) or in the carrying value of the hedged portions of fixed rate debt, as applicable.
F-12 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The carrying value of cash, trade receivables, other current receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities (e.g., deposit liabilities, cash overdrafts, etc.) approximates fair value based on the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
(p) Revenue Recognition Revenue from sales of gases and hardgoods products is recognized when the product is shipped, a sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Rental fees on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk gas storage tanks and other equipment are recognized when earned. For contracts that contain multiple deliverables, principally product supply agreements for gases and container rental, revenue is recognized for each deliverable based on its objectively determinable fair value. For cylinder lease agreements in which rental fees are collected in advance, revenues are deferred and recognized over the term of the lease agreement. Amounts billed for sales tax, value added tax or other transactional taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions are presented on a net basis and are not recognized as revenue.
(q) Cost of Products Sold (Excluding Depreciation) Cost of products sold (excluding depreciation) for the Distribution business segment principally consists of direct material costs, direct labor, manufacturing overhead and freight-in for bulk gas purchases and hardgoods (welding supplies and equipment, safety products and supplies). Maintenance costs associated with cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers and bulk tanks are also reflected in cost of products sold (excluding depreciation).
Cost of products sold (excluding depreciation) for the All Other Operations business segment principally consists of direct material costs, direct labor and freight-in for bulk gas purchases.
(r) Selling, Distribution and Administrative Expenses Selling, distribution and administrative expenses consist of labor and overhead associated with the purchasing, marketing and distribution of the Companys products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting and tax, and facility-related expenses.
(s) Depreciation The Company determines depreciation expense using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company uses accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate. Depreciation expense is recognized on the Companys plant and equipment in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings line item Depreciation.
(t) Shipping and Handling Fees and Distribution Costs The Company recognizes delivery and freight charges to customers as elements of net sales. Costs of third-party freight are recognized as cost of products sold (excluding depreciation). The majority of the costs associated with the distribution of the Companys products, which include labor and overhead associated with filling, warehousing and delivery by Company vehicles, are reflected in selling, distribution and administrative expenses and were $727 million, $692 million and $729 million for the fiscal years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company conducts multiple operations out of the same facilities and does not allocate facility-related expenses to each operational function. Accordingly, there is no facility-related expense in the distribution costs disclosed above. Depreciation expense associated with the Companys delivery fleet of $25 million, $23 million and $18 million was recognized in depreciation for the fiscal years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
(u) Stock-based Compensation The Company grants stock-based compensation awards for its equity incentive plan and employee stock purchase plan. Stock-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated vesting period for each award, with accelerated vesting for retirement-eligible employees in accordance with the provisions of the equity incentive plan. See Note 13 for additional disclosures relating to stock-based compensation.
F-13 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (2) ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGES (a) Recently adopted accounting pronouncements On April1, 2010, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2009-16, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (ASU 2009-16), which affected the accounting treatment of its trade receivables securitization program. The Company currently participates in a trade receivables securitization agreement (the Securitization Agreement) with three commercial banks to which it sells qualifying trade receivables on a revolving basis. The amount of receivables securitized under the Securitization Agreement was $295 million at both March31, 2011 and 2010. Under the new guidance, proceeds received under the Securitization Agreement are treated as secured borrowings, whereas previously they were treated as proceeds from the sale of trade receivables. The impact of the new accounting treatment resulted in the recognition of both the trade receivables securitized under the program and the borrowings they collateralize on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which led to a $295 million increase in trade receivables and long-term debt. Additionally, net new borrowings under the Securitization Agreement are classified as financing activities on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Prior to April1, 2010, they were treated as proceeds from the sale of trade receivables and reflected net of collections on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as operating activities. With respect to the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the amounts previously recorded within the line item Discount on securitization of trade receivables, which represented the difference between the proceeds from the sale and the carrying value of the receivables under the Securitization Agreement, are now reflected within Interest expense, net as borrowing costs, consistent with the new accounting treatment. There was no impact to the Companys consolidated net earnings as a result of the change in accounting principle. Additionally, the Companys debt covenants were not impacted by the balance sheet recognition of the borrowings as a result of the new accounting guidance, as borrowings under the Securitization Agreement were already factored into the debt covenant calculations.
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-16, the funding transactions under the Securitization Agreement were accounted for as sales of trade receivables. The Company retained a subordinated interest in the trade receivables sold, which was recorded at the trade receivables previous carrying value. Subordinated retained interests of approximately $142 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $23 million, were included in trade receivables on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at March31, 2010. Under the previous accounting treatment, management calculated the fair value of the retained interest based on managements best estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash collections on the trade receivables, with changes in the fair value recognized as bad debt expense.
On April1, 2010, the Company adopted ASU No.2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities (ASU 2009-17). ASU 2009-17 established new standards that changed the consolidation model for variable interest entities (VIEs), including (1)changes in considerations as to whether an entity is a VIE, (2)a qualitative rather than quantitative assessment to identify the primary beneficiary of a VIE, (3)an ongoing rather than event-driven assessment of the VIEs primary beneficiary, and (4)the elimination of the qualified special purpose entity scope exception. The new guidance did not result in the deconsolidation of the Companys existing VIE, which is the bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity used to collateralize trade receivables under the Securitization Agreement.
(b) Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No.2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements  a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13), which addresses the allocation of revenue in arrangements containing multiple deliverables. Specifically, ASU 2009-13 modifies existing GAAP by providing new guidance concerning (1)the determination of whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting, and (2)the manner in which arrangement consideration should be allocated to such deliverables. The guidance requires the use of an entitys best estimate of the selling price of a deliverable if vendor specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of the selling price cannot be determined. Additionally, ASU 2009-13 eliminates the use of the residual method of allocating consideration when vendor specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of the selling price is known for some, but not all, of the delivered items in a multiple element arrangement. Finally, ASU 2009-13 requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures in the financial statements. ASU 2009-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance may be applied either prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year for new or materially modified arrangements, or it may be applied retrospectively. The Company currently has contracts in place that contain multiple deliverables, principally product supply agreements for gases and container rental. The Company treats the deliverables in these arrangements under current GAAP as separate units of accounting with selling prices derived from Company specific or third-party evidence. The Company adopted the new guidance, prospectively, on April1, 2011. The new guidance is not expected to significantly modify the accounting for these types of arrangements.
F-14 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No.2010-28, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts  a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2010-28), which provides additional guidance on when Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test must be performed. The guidance clarifies that for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts, Step 2 must be performed if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists based on the evaluation of certain qualitative factors. ASU 2010-28 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December15, 2010, with early adoption prohibited. The Company adopted the new guidance on April1, 2011 with no impact on its consolidated financial statements. Future goodwill impairment tests will follow the requirements of the new guidance.
In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No.2010-29, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations  a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2010-29), which provides clarification on disclosure requirements and amends current guidance to require entities to disclose pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the current year had been as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. Qualitative disclosures describing the nature and amount of any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combinations included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings are also required. ASU 2010-29 is effective for business combinations with acquisition dates on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2010-29 on April1, 2011. Pro forma disclosures for future acquisitions will follow the new guidance.
(3) ACQUISITIONS Acquisitions occurring in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were recorded using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the revised guidance on business combinations, which the Company adopted on April1, 2009. The results of acquired companies operations have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since the effective date of each respective acquisition.
Fiscal 2011 During fiscal 2011, the Company purchased eight businesses. The largest of these businesses was Conley Gas, Ltd. (Conley), a supplier of pure gases to the specialty gas industry with historical annual sales of approximately $9 million. A total of $21.2 million in cash was paid for the eight businesses and for the settlement of holdback liabilities and contingent consideration arrangements associated with acquisitions that were completed in years prior to fiscal 2010. Transaction and other integration costs incurred in fiscal 2011 and included in the Companys fiscal 2011 results were insignificant. These businesses had aggregate historical annual sales of approximately $21 million. Net sales from current year acquisitions that were included in the Companys fiscal 2011 results were $7 million. The Company acquired these businesses in order to expand its geographic coverage and strengthen its national network of branch-store locations.
Purchase Price Allocation The Company negotiated the respective purchase prices of the businesses based on the expected cash flows to be derived from their operations after integration into the Companys existing distribution network. The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to fiscal 2011 acquisitions, as well as adjustments to finalize the valuations of certain prior year acquisitions. Purchase price allocations are based on third-party valuations and managements estimates. The purchase price allocations related to fiscal 2011 acquisitions are substantially complete with the exception of plant and equipment and intangibles for Conley, which continue to be based on provisional fair values and are subject to revision as the Company finalizes appraisals and other analyses. Adjustments to provisional amounts for fiscal 2011 and 2010 acquisitions were not significant. Final determination of the fair values may result in further adjustments to the values presented below.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The fair value of trade receivables acquired with fiscal 2011 acquisitions was $2.3 million, which approximated gross contractual amounts receivable. Goodwill associated with fiscal 2011 acquisitions was $7.3 million and is deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill largely consists of expected synergies resulting from the acquisitions, including the expansion of geographical coverage that will facilitate the sale of industrial, medical and specialty gases and related supplies. Intangible assets related to fiscal 2011 acquisitions represent customer relationships and non-competition agreements and amounted to $5.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively. See Note 7 for further information on goodwill and intangible assets, including the allocation by segment.
In connection with acquisitions prior to the April1, 2009 adoption of the revised guidance on business combinations, the Company is a party to contingent payment agreements that provide for additional consideration to be paid to sellers if the future earnings of the acquired businesses exceed predetermined amounts. Amounts payable under contingent payment agreements continue through 2019 and are limited to $7.9 million. Such amounts, if paid, will be treated as additional costs of the acquisitions.
Pro Forma Operating Results The following table provides unaudited pro forma results of operations as if fiscal 2011 and 2010 acquisitions had occurred on April1, 2009. The pro forma results were prepared from financial information obtained from the sellers of the businesses, as well as information obtained during the due diligence process associated with the acquisitions. The unaudited pro forma results reflect certain adjustments related to the acquisitions, such as increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the stepped-up basis to fair value of the assets acquired and adjustments to reflect the Companys borrowing and tax rates. The pro forma operating results do not include any anticipated synergies related to combining the businesses. Accordingly, such pro forma operating results were prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisitions been made as of April1, 2009 or of results that may occur in the future.

A total of $80.8 million in cash was paid for the six businesses and for the settlement of holdback liabilities and contingent consideration arrangements associated with certain prior year acquisitions. Transaction and other integration costs incurred in fiscal 2010 and included in the Companys fiscal 2010 results were insignificant. These businesses had aggregate historical annual revenues of approximately $47 million. Net sales from fiscal 2010 acquisitions that were included in the Companys fiscal 2010 results were $14 million. The Company acquired these businesses in order to expand its geographic coverage and strengthen its national network of branch-store locations.

With the acquisition of Refron, Inc., the Company formed Airgas Refrigerants, Inc. and merged the newly acquired operations with its existing refrigerant gas business. Airgas Refrigerants, Inc. is reflected in the All Other Operations business segment.
Other significant acquisitions included Oilind Safety, an Arizona-based provider of industrial safety services offering a full array of rental equipment, safety supplies and technical support and training with historical annual sales of $23 million; A&N Plant, a European-based supplier of positioning and welding equipment for sale and rent with historical annual sales of $20 million; and Gordon Woods Industrial Welding Supply, an industrial gas and welding supply distributor with ten locations in the northern Los Angeles area with historical annual sales of $25 million. These acquisitions were merged into the operations of the Distribution business segment.
The 14 businesses acquired in fiscal 2009 had aggregate historical annual sales of approximately $205 million. A total of $274 million in cash was paid for these businesses, including the settlement of acquisition-related holdbacks.The Company acquired the businesses to expand its geographic coverage and strengthen its national network of branch-store locations, as well as strengthen its refrigerant gas, safety product offerings, and international presence.
Purchase Price Allocation The table below summarizes, as of March31, 2009, the allocation of the purchase price of all fiscal 2009 acquisitions by business segment, as well as adjustments to finalize the valuations of certain fiscal 2008 acquisitions. Subsequent adjustments to the provisional valuations below are reflected in the fiscal 2010 purchase price allocation table above and were not significant. The credit of $46 thousand in the All Other Operations business segment is attributable to a reduction of $1.43 million related to plant and equipment adjustments to fiscal 2008 acquisitions, net of $1.39 million of plant and equipment acquired in acquisitions. Of the total goodwill in the table below, $84 million is deductible for income tax purposes. Additionally, $85 million of the $91 million allocated to other intangible assets represents value assigned to customer relationships, with the remaining $6 million representing non-competition agreements.

This benefit has been recorded in capital in excess of par value.
The Company has recorded deferred tax assets related to the expected future tax benefits of state net operating losses of $22.3 million and $22.2 million as of March31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. State loss carryforwards expire at various times through 2031.
F-19 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences and carryforward deferred tax assets become deductible or utilized. Management considers the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.
Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets reverse, at March31, 2011 management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances. Valuation allowances relate to certain state net operating loss carryforwards. In fiscal 2011, the Company revised its estimates of the realizability of certain tax benefits associated with state net operating loss carryforwards. Those revisions along with changes due to the realization and expiration of net operating loss carryforwards resulted in a $1.2 million increase in the related valuation allowance at March31, 2011.
U.S. income taxes have not been provided on approximately $70 million of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries because it is the Companys intention to continue to reinvest these earnings in those subsidiaries to support their growth. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability relating to such amounts.
As of March31, 2011, the Company has unrecognized state tax benefits of approximately $14.7 million, which were recorded in other non-current liabilities, and a related $5.1 million of federal tax assets associated with those state tax benefits recorded in other non-current assets. If recognized, all of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties would reduce tax expense. The Company does not anticipate significant changes in the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits over the next year.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized net income tax benefits, including potential interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions, is as follows: (In thousands) Unrecognized net income tax benefits as of March31, 2009 $ 8,409 Additions for current year tax positions 1,547 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (320 ) Reductions for settlements with taxing authorities (641 ) Reductions as a result of expiration of applicable statutes of limitations (851 ) Unrecognized net income tax benefits as of March31, 2010 8,144 Additions for current year tax positions 1,972 Reductions for tax positions of prior years  Reductions for settlements with taxing authorities (221 ) Reductions as a result of expiration of applicable statutes of limitations (247 ) Unrecognized net income tax benefits as of March31, 2011 $ 9,648 Net interest and penalties of $94 thousand were recognized for the year ended March31, 2011 and were classified as income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements. Consistent with past practice, the Company will continue to record interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The Company also files income tax returns in every state which imposes corporate income tax. The Company is not under examination by the IRS or in any significant foreign, state or local tax jurisdictions. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2007.

Test for Goodwill Impairment The Company is required to perform an assessment of the carrying value of goodwill associated with each of its reporting units at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill may be impaired. The Company elected to perform its annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill as of October31 of each year. The annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill at October31, 2010 indicated that the Companys goodwill was not impaired.
As of October31, 2010, the Company had 18 reporting units in the Distribution business segment and six reporting units in the All Other Operations business segment. The Company determined the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units as of October31, 2010 using a discounted cash flow model and compared those values to the carrying value of each of the respective reporting units. Significant assumptions used in the cash flow model include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on specific reporting unit business plans, future capital expenditures, working capital needs, discount rates and perpetual growth rates. The Companys weighted average cost of capital was approximately 8%. However, the estimate of each reporting units fair value assigns a higher risk premium to smaller entities. Therefore, the discount rates used to estimate the fair value of individual reporting units will be higher than for the company as a whole. At October31, 2010, the discount rates used in the model were 10.5% for the Distribution business segment reporting units and slightly higher rates for the smaller reporting units in the All Other Operations business segment. The perpetual growth rate assumed in the discounted cash flow model was in line with the long-term growth rate as measured by the U.S. Gross Domestic Product and the industrys long-term rate of growth. In addition to Company specific growth targets, general economic conditions, the long-term economic outlook for the U.S. economy, and market conditions affecting borrowing costs and returns on equity all influence the estimated fair value of each of the Companys reporting units.
F-21 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Companys annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial amount. Furthermore, a hypothetical 10% reduction in the fair value of each reporting unit would not indicate that goodwill associated with any reporting unit was potentially impaired.
Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets amounted to approximately $197 million and $213 million, net of accumulated amortization of $75 million and $56 million at March31, 2011 and March31, 2010, respectively. These intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, which are amortized over the estimated benefit periods which range from seven to 17 years, and non-competition agreements, which are amortized over the term of the agreements. The determination of the estimated benefit period associated with customer relationships is based on an analysis of historical customer sales attrition information and other customer-related factors at the date of acquisition. There are no expected residual values related to these intangible assets. The Company evaluates the estimated benefit periods and recoverability of its intangible assets when facts and circumstances indicate that the lives may not be appropriate and/or the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is not recoverable, impairment is measured as the amount by which carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair value is generally estimated based on either appraised value or other valuation techniques. Estimated future amortization expense by fiscal year is as follows: 2012  $22.8 million; 2013  $21.8 million; 2014  $19.5 million; 2015  $18.0 million; 2016  $16.5 million; and $98.6 million thereafter.

Losses on the early extinguishment of the 2018 Notes were $3.6 million for the year ended March31, 2011 and related to the redemption premiums and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.
Senior Credit Facility On September13, 2010, the Company entered into a new four-year $750 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) with a syndicate of lenders. The Credit Facility consists of a $650 million U.S. dollar revolving credit line and a $100 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) multi-currency revolving credit line. The maturity date of the revolving credit lines is September13, 2014. Under circumstances described in the Credit Facility, the revolving credit line may be increased by an additional $325 million, provided that the multi-currency revolving credit line may not be increased by more than an additional $50 million.
In connection with the entry by the Company into the Credit Facility, on September13, 2010, the Companys then existing senior credit facility with an aggregate commitment of $1.7 billion (the Prior Credit Facility) was terminated and all obligations under the Prior Credit Facility (including the term loans) were repaid in full using proceeds of the Credit Facility and other funds. As a result of the termination of the Prior Credit Facility, the Company recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million for the year ended March31, 2011 related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.
As of March31, 2011, the Company had $374 million of borrowings under the Credit Facility, including $331 million under the U.S. dollar revolver and $43 million under the multi-currency revolver. The Company also had outstanding letters of credit of $41 million issued under the Credit Facility. The U.S. dollar revolver borrowings bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 212.5 basis points. The multi-currency revolver bears interest based on a spread of 212.5 basis points over the Euro currency rate applicable to each foreign currency borrowing. As of March31, 2011, the average effective interest rates on the U.S. dollar revolver and the multi-currency revolver were 2.31% and 2.87%, respectively.
The Company also maintains a committed revolving line of credit to fund its operations in France, which is outside of the Companys Credit Facility. The French revolving line of credit was amended in February 2011 to extend the maturity date to December31, 2011 and increase the borrowing capacity from 3.0million to 5.0million (U.S. $7.1 million). At March31, 2011, French revolving credit borrowings were 2.9million (U.S. $4.1 million). The variable interest rates on the French revolving credit borrowings are based on the Euro currency rate plus 212.5 basis points. As of March31, 2011, the effective interest rate on the French revolving credit borrowings was 2.98%.
F-23 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) At March31, 2011, the Credit Facilitys financial covenant did not restrict the Companys ability to borrow on the unused portion of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including nonpayment and breach of covenants. In the event of default, repayment of borrowings under the Credit Facility may be accelerated. The Companys Credit Facility also contains cross-default provisions whereby a default under the Credit Facility could result in defaults under the senior and senior subordinated notes discussed below. As of March31, 2011, $335 million remained unused under the Companys Credit Facility.
Money Market Loans The Company has an agreement with a financial institution that provides access to short-term advances not to exceed $35 million. The agreement expires on December1, 2011, but may be extended subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. The advances are generally overnight or for up to seven days. The amount, term and interest rate of an advance are established through mutual agreement with the financial institution when the Company requests such an advance. At March31, 2011, there were no advances outstanding under the agreement.
The Company also has an agreement with another financial institution that provides access to additional short-term advances not to exceed $35 million. The advances may be for one to six months with rates at a fixed spread over the corresponding LIBOR. At March31, 2011, there were no advances outstanding under the agreement.
Senior Notes On September30, 2010, the Company issued $250 million of 3.25% senior notes maturing on October1, 2015 (the 2015 Notes). The 2015 Notes were issued at a discount and yield 3.283%. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2015 Notes were used to reduce borrowings under the Companys revolving credit line under the Credit Facility. Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semi-annually on April1 and October1 of each year. Additionally, the Company has the option to redeem the 2015 Notes prior to their maturity, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest and applicable make-whole payments.
At March31, 2011, the Company had $400 million outstanding of 4.5% senior notes maturing on September15, 2014 (the 2014 Notes). The 2014 Notes were issued at a discount and yield 4.527%. Interest on the 2014 Notes is payable semi-annually on March15 and September15 of each year. Additionally, the Company has the option to redeem the 2014 Notes prior to their maturity, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest and applicable make-whole payments.
At March31, 2011, the Company had $300 million outstanding of 2.85% senior notes maturing on October1, 2013 (the 2013 Notes). The 2013 Notes were issued at a discount and yield 2.871%. Interest on the 2013 Notes is payable semi-annually on April1 and October1 of each year. Additionally, the Company has the option to redeem the 2013 Notes prior to their maturity, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest and applicable make-whole payments.
The 2013, 2014 and 2015 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the incurrence of liens and limit sale and leaseback transactions.
Senior Subordinated Notes At March31, 2011, the Company had $215 million of its 2018 Notes outstanding. The 2018 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 7.125%, payable semi-annually on October1 and April1 of each year. The 2018 Notes have a redemption provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2018 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is October1, 2013 at a price of 103.563% of the principal amount.
During the year ended March31, 2011, the Company incurred a one-time interest penalty payable to holders of the 2018 Notes in the amount of $2.6 million related to the late removal of the restrictive legend on these notes. The Company has classified these charges as interest expense.
The 2018 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the payment of dividends, the repurchase of common stock, the issuance of preferred stock, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens.
Acquisition and Other Notes The Companys long-term debt also includes acquisition and other notes, principally consisting of notes issued to sellers of businesses acquired, which are repayable in periodic installments. At March31, 2011, acquisition and other notes totaled $9.9 million with an average interest rate of approximately 6% and an average maturity of approximately one year.
F-24 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Trade Receivables Securitization The Company participates in the Securitization Agreement with three commercial banks to which it sells qualifying trade receivables on a revolving basis.Effective April1, 2010 under new accounting guidance, the Companys sale of qualified trade receivables is now accounted for as a secured borrowing under which qualified trade receivables collateralize amounts borrowed from the commercial banks. Trade receivables that collateralize the Securitization Agreement are held in a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity, which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes and represents the Companys only VIE. Qualified trade receivables in the amount of the outstanding borrowing under the Securitization Agreement are not available to the general creditors of the Company. The maximum amount of the Securitization Agreement is $295 million and it bears interest at approximately LIBOR plus 80 basis points. At March31, 2011, the amount of outstanding borrowing under the Securitization Agreement was $295 million and it was classified as long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts borrowed under the Securitization Agreement could fluctuate monthly based on the Companys funding requirements and the level of qualified trade receivables available to collateralize the Securitization Agreement. The Securitization Agreement expires in March 2013 and contains customary events of termination, including standard cross default provisions with respect to outstanding debt.
Aggregate Long-term Debt Maturities The aggregate maturities of long-term debt at March31, 2011 are as follows: DebtMaturities (In thousands) Years Ending March 31, (a) 2012 $ 9,868 2013 297,921 2014 300,526 2015 774,584 2016 250,100 Thereafter 215,520 $ 1,848,519 (a ) Outstanding borrowings under the Securitization Agreement at March31, 2011 are reflected as maturing at the agreements expiration in March 2013.
The 2013, 2014 and 2015 Notes are reflected in the debt maturity schedule at their maturity values rather than their carrying values, which are net of discounts of $152 thousand, $336 thousand and $340 thousand, respectively. The 2013 Notes also include additional carrying value of $5.2 million at March31, 2011 related to the Companys fair value hedges  see Note 10 for additional disclosure.
(10) DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The Companys involvement with derivative instruments is limited to highly effective interest rate swap agreements used to manage well-defined interest rate risk exposures and treasury rate lock agreements used to fix the interest rate related to forecasted debt issuances. The Company monitors its positions and credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties. Interest rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements are not entered into for trading purposes. The Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At March31, 2011, the Company was party to a total of five interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million.
Cash Flow Hedges The Company designates fixed interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges of interest payments on variable-rate debt associated with the Companys Securitization Agreement. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings.
During fiscal 2011, fixed interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $250 million matured and at March31, 2011, the Company was not party to any fixed interest rate swap agreements.
F-25 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) For the year ended March31, 2011, the fair value of the liability for the fixed interest rate swap agreements decreased and the Company recorded a corresponding adjustment to AOCI of $4.0 million, or $2.7 million after tax. For the year ended March31, 2010, the fair value of the liability for the fixed interest rate swap agreements decreased and the Company recorded a corresponding adjustment to AOCI of $8.6 million, or $5.6 million after tax. The amount of gain or loss recorded in earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness related to the designated cash flow hedges was immaterial for the years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
In anticipation of the issuance of the 2015 Notes, the Company entered into a treasury rate lock agreement in July 2010, with a notional amount of $100 million, maturing on September8, 2010. The treasury rate lock agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge of the semi-annual interest payments associated with the forecasted issuance of the 2015 Notes. When the treasury rate lock agreement matured, the Company incurred a loss of $2.6 million ($1.6 million after tax) which is reported as a component within AOCI and will be reclassified into earnings over the term of the 2015 Notes. For the year ended March31, 2011, $258 thousand of the loss on the treasury rate lock was reclassified to interest expense. At March31, 2011, the estimated loss recorded in AOCI on the treasury rate lock agreement that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is $326 thousand, net of tax.
Fair Value Hedges The Company also has variable interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.
At March31, 2011, the Company had five variable interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional amount of $300 million. These variable interest rate swaps effectively convert the Companys $300 million of fixed rate 2013 Notes to variable rate debt. At March31, 2011, these swap agreements required the Company to make variable interest payments based on a weighted average forward rate of 2.17% and receive fixed interest payments from the counterparties based on a fixed rate of 2.85%. The maturity of these fair value swaps coincides with the maturity date of the Companys 2013 Notes in October 2013. During the year ended March31, 2011, the fair value of the variable interest rate swaps increased by $5.7 million to an asset of $5.1 million and was recorded in other non-current assets. The corresponding increase in the carrying value of the 2013 Notes caused by the hedged risk was $5.6 million and was recorded in long-term debt. The Company records the gain or loss on the hedged item (i.e., the 2013 Notes) and the gain or loss on the variable interest rate swaps in interest expense. The net gain or loss recorded in earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness related to the designated fair value hedges was immaterial for the years ended March31, 2011 and 2010.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (11) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are classified based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. The hierarchical levels related to the subjectivity of the valuation inputs are defined as follows:  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable, directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data at the measurement date.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect managements best estimate of the assumptions (including assumptions about risk) that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
The carrying value of cash, trade receivables, other current receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities (e.g., deposit liabilities, cash overdrafts, etc.) approximates fair value.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March31, 2011 and March31, 2010 are categorized in the table below based on the lowest level of significant input to the valuation.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Deferred compensation plan assets and corresponding liabilities The Companys deferred compensation plan assets consist of open-ended mutual funds (Level 1), and are included within other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companys deferred compensation plan liabilities are equal to the plans assets and are included within other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses on the deferred compensation plan assets are recognized as other income (expense), net, while gains or losses on the deferred compensation plan liabilities are recognized as compensation expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
Derivative assets  interest rate swap agreements The Companys variable interest rate swap agreements are with highly rated counterparties, are designated as fair value hedges and effectively convert the Companys fixed rate 2013 Notes to variable rate debt. The swap agreements are valued using an income approach that relies on observable market inputs such as interest rate yield curves and treasury spreads (Level 2). Expected future cash flows are converted to a present value amount based upon market expectations of the changes in these interest rate yield curves. The fair values of the Companys interest rate swap agreements are included within other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March31, 2011. See Note 10 for additional derivatives disclosures.
The carrying value of debt, which is reported on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets, generally reflects the cash proceeds received upon its issuance, net of subsequent repayments. The fair value of the Companys variable interest rate revolving credit borrowings disclosed in the table below were estimated based on observable forward yield curves and unobservable credit spreads management believes a market participant would assume for these facilities under market conditions as of the balance sheet date. The fair value of the fixed rate notes disclosed below were determined based on quoted prices from the broker/dealer market, observable market inputs for similarly termed treasury notes adjusted for the Companys credit spread and unobservable inputs management believes a market participant would use in determining imputed interest for obligations without a stated interest rate. The fair value of the securitized receivables approximates its carrying value.

During fiscal 2009, the Company paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.12 per share at the end of each of the first two quarters and $0.16 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Companys earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by management and the Companys Board of Directors.
(d) Stockholder Rights Plan Effective May8, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan (the 2007 Rights Plan). Pursuant to the 2007 Rights Plan, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right for each share of common stock. Each right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one ten-thousandth of a share of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an initial exercise price of $230 per share. The 2007 Rights Plan is intended to assure that all of the Companys stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the Company and to protect stockholders interests in the event the Company is confronted with partial tender offers or other coercive or unfair takeover tactics.
Rights become exercisable after ten days following the acquisition by a person or group of 15% (or 20% in the case of Peter McCausland and certain of his affiliates) or more of the Companys outstanding common stock, or ten business days (or later if determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with the plan) after the announcement of a tender offer or exchange offer to acquire 15% (or 20% in the case of Peter McCausland and certain of his affiliates) or more of the outstanding common stock. If such a person or group acquires 15% or more (or 20% or more, as the case may be) of the common stock, each right (other than such persons or groups rights, which will become void) will entitle the holder to purchase, at the exercise price, common stock having a market value equal to twice the exercise price. In certain circumstances, the rights may be redeemed by the Company at an initial redemption price of $0.0001 per right. If not redeemed, the rights will expire on May8, 2017.
(e) Stock Repurchase Programs In November 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan that provided the Company with the authorization to repurchase up to $150 million of its common stock. The plan was suspended in July 2006 while the Company consummated its acquisitions of Linde AGs U.S. bulk and packaged gas assets. In March 2008, the Company announced the reinstatement of its plan. During fiscal 2009, 2.4million shares were repurchased for $115.6 million. A total of 4.1million shares were repurchased under the plan for $150 million, satisfying the original $150 million authorized for common stock repurchase.
In February 2011, the Executive Committee of the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that provided the Company with the authorization to repurchase up to $300 million of its common stock. By March31, 2011, 4.8million shares had been repurchased for $300 million.
In May 2011, the Company announced a new program to repurchase up to $300 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. See Note 24 for subsequent event disclosure.
(f) Comprehensive Income The Companys comprehensive income was $254 million, $210 million and $255 million for the years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Comprehensive income consists of net earnings, foreign currency translation adjustments, net gain or loss on derivative instruments and the net tax expense or benefit of other comprehensive income items. Net tax expense or benefit of comprehensive income items pertains to the Companys derivative instruments only, as foreign currency translation adjustments relate to permanent investments in foreign subsidiaries. The net gain or loss on derivative instruments reflects valuation adjustments for changes in interest rates, as well as cash settlements with the counterparties and reclassification adjustments to income. During the year ended March31, 2011, cash settlements with the counterparties of $4.2 million were reclassified from AOCI to net earnings as interest expense. The table below presents the gross and net changes in the balances within each component of AOCI for the year ended March31, 2011.

On August18, 2009, the Companys stockholders approved the Amended and Restated 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, which included, among other things, a 2.6million increase in the number of shares available for issuance under the plan. At March31, 2011, a total of 7.5million shares were authorized under the 2006 Equity Plan, as amended, for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company, of which 2.8million shares of common stock were available for issuance.
Stock options granted prior to April1, 2006 vest 25% annually and have a maximum term of ten years. Stock options granted subsequent to April1, 2006 also vest 25% annually and have a maximum term of eight years.
Fair Value The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $22.72, $14.50 and $18.17, respectively. The following assumptions were used by the Company in valuing the stock option grants issued in each fiscal year: F-31 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Stock Option Grant Assumptions Fiscal2011 Fiscal2010 Fiscal2009 Expected volatility 41.9 % 39.5 % 29.6 % Expected dividend yield 1.42 % 1.75 % 0.90 % Expected term 5.6years 5.6years 5.6years Risk-free interest rate 2.1 % 2.3 % 3.2 % The expected volatility assumption used in valuing stock options was determined based on anticipated changes in the underlying stock price over the expected term using historical daily changes of the Companys closing stock price. The expected dividend yield was based on the Companys history and expectation of future dividend payouts. The expected term represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding prior to exercise or forfeiture. The expected term was determined based on historical exercise patterns. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury rates in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected term.
Summary of Stock Option Activity The following table summarizes the stock option activity during the three years ended March31, 2011: Number of StockOptions Weighted-Average Exercise Price Per Share Aggregate IntrinsicValue (Inthousands) Outstanding at March31, 2008 6,632,703 $ 23.52 Granted 1,120,273 $ 59.67 Exercised (1,027,129 ) $ 15.76 Forfeited (85,478 ) $ 31.63 Outstanding at March31, 2009 6,640,369 $ 30.71 $ 60,142 Granted 1,425,650 $ 43.15 Exercised (1,299,528 ) $ 16.82 Forfeited (59,473 ) $ 18.50 Outstanding at March31, 2010 6,707,018 $ 36.15 $ 184,230 Granted 1,047,300 $ 62.56 Exercised (812,304 ) $ 27.20 Forfeited (56,428 ) $ 50.38 Outstanding at March31, 2011 6,885,586 $ 41.11 $ 174,350 Vested or expected to vest as of March31, 2011 6,745,105 $ 40.79 $ 172,944 Exercisable as of March31, 2011 4,179,865 $ 33.23 $ 138,796 The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of each fiscal year and the exercise price of in-the-money stock options multiplied by the number of stock options outstanding or exercisable as of that date. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $31.4 million, $46.7 million and $33.1 million, respectively. The weighted-average remaining contractual term of stock options outstanding as of March31, 2011 was 4.6 years. Common stock to be issued in conjunction with future stock option exercises will be obtained from either new shares or shares from treasury stock.
As of March31, 2011, $31.8 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.7 years.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) encourages and assists employees in acquiring an equity interest in the Company. The ESPP is authorized to issue up to 5.5million shares of Company common stock, of which 2.1million shares were available for issuance at March31, 2011, 67thousand shares of which were issued on April1, 2011.
F-32 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Under the terms of the ESPP, eligible employees may elect to have up to 15% of their annual gross earnings withheld to purchase common stock at 85% of the market value. Employee purchases are limited in any calendar year to an aggregate market value of $25,000. Market value under the ESPP is defined as either the closing share price on the New York Stock Exchange as of an employees enrollment date or the closing price on the first business day of a fiscal quarter when the shares are purchased, whichever is lower. An employee may lock-in a purchase price for up to 12 months. The ESPP effectively resets at the beginning of each fiscal year at which time employees are re-enrolled in the plan and a new 12-month purchase price is established. The ESPP is designed to comply with the requirements of Sections 421 and 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Compensation expense is measured based on the fair value of the employees option to purchase shares of common stock at the grant date and is recognized over the future periods in which the related employee service is rendered. The fair value per share of employee options to purchase shares under the ESPP was $16.05, $12.52 and $12.46 for the years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The fair value of the employees option to purchase shares of common stock was estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The following assumptions were used by the Company in valuing the employees option to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP: ESPP Purchase Option Assumptions: Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Expected volatility 41.8 % 72.2 % 61.3 % Expected dividend yield 1.01 % 1.61 % 1.07 % Expected term 3to9months 3to12months 3to6months Risk-free interest rate 0.2 % 0.4 % 1.7 % The following table summarizes the activity of the ESPP during the three years ended March31, 2011: ESPP - Purchase Option Activity Numberof PurchaseOptions Weighted-Average Exercise Price Per Share Aggregate IntrinsicValue (Inthousands) Outstanding at March31, 2008 108,634 $ 36.21 Granted 463,443 $ 35.52 Exercised (439,325 ) $ 37.57 Outstanding at March31, 2009 132,752 $ 29.30 $ 599 Granted 512,327 $ 29.29 Exercised (523,507 ) $ 29.47 Outstanding at March31, 2010 121,572 $ 28.53 $ 4,266 Granted 283,293 $ 52.73 Exercised (338,037 ) $ 44.37 Outstanding at March 31, 2011 66,828 $ 51.03 $ 1,028 F-33 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC.

The Company classified these charges as interest expense.
(15) EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of the Companys common stock outstanding during the period. Outstanding shares consist of issued shares less treasury stock. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average common shares outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents related to stock options and the Companys ESPP.
Outstanding stock options that are anti-dilutive are excluded from the Companys diluted earnings per share computation. There were approximately 1.3million, 2.4million, and 1.9million shares covered by outstanding stock options that were not dilutive for the years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: (In thousands, except per share amounts) Years Ended March31, Basic Earnings per Share Computation 2011 2010 2009 Numerator: Net earnings $ 249,766 $ 196,300 $ 261,088 Denominator: Basic shares outstanding 83,487 82,129 81,926 Basic net earnings per share $ 2.99 $ 2.39 $ 3.19 (In thousands, except per share amounts) Years Ended March 31, Diluted Earnings per Share Computation 2011 2010 2009 Numerator: Net earnings $ 249,766 $ 196,300 $ 261,088 Denominator: Basic shares outstanding 83,487 82,129 81,926 Incremental shares from assumed exercises and conversions: Stock options and options under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan 1,765 1,658 1,890 Diluted shares outstanding 85,252 83,787 83,816 Diluted net earnings per share $ 2.93 $ 2.34 $ 3.12 F-34 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (16) LEASES The Company leases certain distribution facilities, fleet vehicles and equipment under long-term operating leases with varying terms. Most leases contain renewal options and in some instances, purchase options. Rentals under these operating leases for the years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled approximately $101 million, $102 million and $99 million, respectively. Certain operating facilities are leased at market rates from employees of the Company who were previous owners of businesses acquired. Outstanding capital lease obligations and the related capital assets are not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets at March31, 2011 and 2010. In connection with the fleet vehicle operating leases, the Company guarantees a residual value of $27 million, representing approximately 15% of the original cost.
At March31, 2011, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: (In thousands) Years Ending March 31, 2012 $ 82,363 2013 63,870 2014 45,776 2015 31,400 2016 19,754 Thereafter 25,493 $ 268,656 (17) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (a) Litigation The Company is involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. These actions, when ultimately concluded and determined, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect upon the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
On February11, 2010, Air Products& Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products) initiated an unsolicited tender offer for all of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with this unsolicited takeover attempt, Air Products filed an action against the Company and members of its Board in the Delaware Court of Chancery. In the suit, Air Products sought, among other things, an order declaring that members of the Companys Board breached their fiduciary duties by refusing to negotiate with Air Products. Additionally, a number of purported stockholder class action lawsuits were commenced against the Company and/or the members of the Airgas Board in the Delaware Court of Chancery. These suits, which were later consolidated, alleged, among other things, that the members of the Airgas Board breached their fiduciary duties by refusing to negotiate with Air Products, failing to seek more valuable alternatives and failing to redeem the Companys shareholder rights plan.
On February15, 2011, the Delaware Court of Chancery denied in their entirety all requests for relief by Air Products and by the plaintiffs in the stockholder class action lawsuits, and dismissed with prejudice all claims asserted against the Company and its directors. Air Products promptly terminated its unsolicited tender offer and no appeal of the Courts decision was filed by Air Products or the stockholder plaintiffs.
As disclosed in Note 23  Unsolicited Takeover Attempt, the Company has incurred substantial legal and professional fees and other costs related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and associated litigation through March31, 2011.
(b) Insurance Coverage The Company has established insurance programs to cover workers compensation, business automobile and general liability claims. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, these programs had high deductible limits of $1 million per occurrence. For fiscal 2012, the high deductible limits will remain $1 million per occurrence. The Company believes its insurance reserves are adequate. The Company accrues estimated losses using actuarial models and assumptions based on historical loss experience. The nature of the Companys business may subject it to product and general liability lawsuits. To the extent that the Company is subject to claims that exceed its liability insurance coverage, such suits could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
F-35 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Company maintains a self-insured health benefits plan, which provides medical benefits to employees electing coverage under the plan. The Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported medical claims and claim development. The reserve is an estimate based on historical experience and other assumptions, some of which are subjective. The Company adjusts its self-insured medical benefits reserve as the Companys loss experience changes due to medical inflation, changes in the number of plan participants and an aging employee base.
(c) Supply Agreements The Company purchases bulk quantities of industrial gases under long-term take-or-pay supply agreements. The Company is a party to a long-term take-or-pay supply agreement, in effect through August 2017, under which Air Products will supply the Company with bulk nitrogen, oxygen, argon and helium. The Company is committed to purchase approximately $53 million annually in bulk gases under the Air Products supply agreements. The Company also has long-term take-or-pay supply agreements with Linde AG to purchase oxygen, nitrogen, argon and helium. The agreements expire at various dates through July 2019 and represent approximately $49million in annual bulk gas purchases. Additionally, the Company has long-term take-or-pay supply agreements to purchase oxygen, nitrogen and argon from other major producers. Annual purchases under these contracts are approximately $14 million and they expire at various dates through June 2024. The annual purchase commitments above reflect estimates based on fiscal 2011 purchases.
The Company also purchases liquid carbon dioxide and ammonia under take-or-pay supply agreements. The Company is a party to long-term take-or-pay supply agreements for the purchase of liquid carbon dioxide with approximately 15 suppliers that expire at various dates through 2044 and represent purchases of approximately $19 million in fiscal 2012. The Company purchases ammonia from a variety of sources and is obligated to purchase approximately $3.1 million annually under these contracts. The annual purchase commitments reflect estimates based on fiscal 2011 purchases.
The supply agreements noted above contain periodic pricing adjustments based on certain economic indices and market analyses. The Company believes the minimum product purchases under the agreements are within the Companys normal product purchases. Actual purchases in future periods under the supply agreements could differ materially from those presented above due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions. The Company believes that if a long-term supply agreement with a major supplier of gases or other raw materials was terminated, it would look to utilize excess internal production capacity and to locate alternative sources of supply to meet customer requirements. The Company purchases hardgoods from major manufacturers and suppliers. For certain products, the Company has negotiated national purchasing arrangements. The Company believes that if an arrangement with any supplier of hardgoods was terminated, it would be able to negotiate comparable alternative supply arrangements.
At March31, 2011, future commitments under take-or-pay supply agreements were as follows: (In thousands) Years Ending March 31, 2012 $ 138,516 2013 130,739 2014 119,100 2015 111,555 2016 109,304 Thereafter 254,747 $ 863,961 (d) Construction Commitments At March31, 2011, the Companys remaining construction commitments totaled approximately $29 million. Construction commitments represent an outstanding commitment to a customer to construct an on-site air separation unit in Clarksville, Tennessee. The Clarksville, Tennessee plant is expected to be completed by mid fiscal 2013.
F-36 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (e) Letters of Credit At March31, 2011, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $41 million. Letters of credit are guarantees of payment to third parties. The Companys letters of credit principally back obligations associated with the Companys self-insured retention on workers compensation, business automobile and general liability claims. The letters of credit are supported by the Companys Credit Facility.
(18) BENEFIT PLANS The Company has a defined contribution 401(k) plan (the 401(k) plan) covering substantially all full-time employees. Under the terms of the 401(k) plan, the Company makes matching contributions of up to two percent of participant wages. Amounts expensed under the 401(k) plan for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $10.1 million, $9.2 million and $8.6 million, respectively.
The Company participates in several multi-employer pension plans (MEPPs) providing defined benefits to union employees under the terms of collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). Contributions have been made to the plans in accordance with negotiated CBAs. The plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers.
In connection with the negotiation of CBA renewals, the Company has replaced defined benefit MEPPs for CBA employees with defined contribution plans. As part of the withdrawal from a MEPP, the Company is required to fund its portion of the MEPPs unfunded pension obligation, if any. The ultimate amount of the withdrawal liability assessed by the MEPP is impacted by a number of factors, including investment returns, benefit levels, interest rates and continued participation by the Company and other employers in the MEPP. The Company recognized charges related to the withdrawal from these plans of $4.6 million, $6.7 million and $2.1 million for the years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. MEPP withdrawal liabilities amounted to $16.0 million at March31, 2011 and $12.9 million at March31, 2010. These estimates are subject to change based on further review of pending information requested from certain pension funds, arbitration hearings and the receipt of final withdrawal assessments from certain pension funds.
During fiscal 2012, the Company intends to negotiate withdrawals from the MEPPs provided for in its three remaining CBAs that provide for such plans. These CBAs cover approximately 30 employees and, assuming a complete withdrawal from these MEPPs, the Company estimates the additional withdrawal liability to be approximately $5 million as of March31, 2011. Though the most recent plan data available from the remaining MEPPs was used in computing this estimate, it is subject to change based on future market conditions, pension fund assets, unfunded vested benefit obligation amounts, employer contributions and benefit levels that will impact the ultimate withdrawal liability should the Company successfully negotiate the withdrawal from the MEPPs provided for in the remaining CBAs.
The Company has a deferred compensation plan that is a non-qualified plan. The deferred compensation plan allows eligible employees and non-employee directors, who elect to participate in the plan, to defer receipt of taxable compensation .
Participants may set aside up to a maximum of 75% of their salary and up to a maximum of 100% of their bonus compensation in tax-deferred investments. The Companys deferred compensation plan liabilities are funded through an irrevocable rabbi trust. The assets of the trust, which consist of exchange traded open-ended mutual funds, cannot be reached by the Company or its creditors except in the event of the Companys insolvency or bankruptcy. Assets held in the rabbi trust were $9.2 million and $7.6 million at March31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included within other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companys deferred compensation plan liabilities were $9.2 million and $7.6 million at March31, 2011 and 2010, respectively and are included within other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses on the deferred compensation plan assets are recognized as other income (expense), net, while gains or losses on the deferred compensation plan liabilities are recognized as compensation expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
(19) RELATED PARTIES The Company purchases and sells goods and services in the ordinary course of business with certain corporations in which some of its directors are officers or directors. The Company also leases certain operating facilities from employees who were previous owners of businesses acquired. Payments made to related parties for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $4.2 million, $2.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively. Amounts paid to related parties represented values considered fair and reasonable and reflective of arms length transactions.

The remaining interest penalty of $0.3 million was paid to note holders on April1, 2011, concurrent with the scheduled interest payment on the 2018 Notes. The Company classified these charges as interest expense.
Significant Non-cash Investing and Financing Transactions During the years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company purchased $4.4 million, $4.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, of rental welders, which were financed directly by a vendor. The vendor financing was reflected as long-term debt on the respective Consolidated Balance Sheets. Future cash payments in settlement of the debt will be reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows when paid.
(21) SUMMARY BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The Company aggregates its operations, based on products and services, into two reportable business segments, Distribution and All Other Operations. The Distribution business segments principal products include industrial, medical and specialty gases sold in packaged and bulk quantities, as well as hardgoods. The Companys air separation facilities and national specialty gas labs primarily produce gases that are sold by the Distribution business segments business units. Gas sales include nitrogen, oxygen, argon, helium, hydrogen, welding and fuel gases such as acetylene, propylene and propane, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, ultra high purity grades, special application blends and process chemicals. Business units in the Distribution business segment also recognize rental revenue, derived from gas cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk storage tanks, tube trailers and welding and welding related equipment. Gas and rent represented 60%, 61% and 57% of the Distribution business segments sales in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Hardgoods consist of welding consumables and equipment, safety products, construction supplies, and maintenance, repair and operating supplies. Hardgoods sales represented 40%, 39% and 43% of the Distribution business segments sales in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Distribution business segment accounted for approximately 90% of consolidated sales in each of the fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009.
The All Other Operations business segment consists of six business units which primarily manufacture and/or distribute carbon dioxide, dry ice, nitrous oxide, ammonia and refrigerant gases. The business units reflected in the All Other Operations business segment individually do not meet the thresholds to be reported as separate business segments. Elimination entries represent intercompany sales from the Companys All Other Operations business segment to its Distribution business segment.
The Companys operations are predominantly in the United States. However, the Company does conduct operations outside of the United States, principally in Canada and, to a lesser extent, Mexico, Russia, Dubai and Europe. Revenues derived from foreign countries, based on the point of sale, were $75 million, $77 million and $86 million in the fiscal years ended March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Long-lived assets attributable to the Companys foreign operations represent less than 4.0% of the consolidated total long-lived assets and were $142 million, $141 million and $116 million at March31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Companys customer base is diverse with its largest customer accounting for approximately 0.5% of total net sales.
F-38 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Note 1). Certain reclassifications were made to the presentation of business segment operating results for the prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications were the result of changes made to the allocation of corporate operating expenses. Although corporate operating expenses are generally allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars, the Company reports expenses related to the implementation of its SAP system and the Companys withdrawal from various MEPPs under selling, distribution and administrative expenses in the eliminations and other column below. Previously these costs were allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars. Consolidated operating income and net earnings for the prior periods were not impacted by these reclassifications. Additionally, the legal and professional fees incurred as a result of Air Products unsolicited tender offer were not allocated to the Companys business segments. These costs are also reflected in the eliminations and other column below. Corporate assets have been allocated to the Distribution business segment, intercompany sales are recorded on the same basis as sales to third parties, and intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. See Note 3 for the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the operating results of each business segment. Management utilizes more than one measurement and multiple views of data to measure segment performance and to allocate resources to the segments. However, the predominant measurements are consistent with the Companys consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, are reported on the same basis below.

(23) UNSOLICITED TAKEOVER ATTEMPT On February11, 2010, Air Products initiated an unsolicited tender offer for all of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with this unsolicited takeover attempt, Air Products filed an action against the Company and members of its Board in the Delaware Court of Chancery. In the suit, Air Products sought, among other things, an order declaring that members of the Companys Board breached their fiduciary duties by refusing to negotiate with Air Products. Additionally, a number of purported stockholder class action lawsuits were commenced against the Company and/or the members of the Airgas Board in the Delaware Court of Chancery. These suits, which were later consolidated, alleged, among other things, that the members of the Airgas Board breached their fiduciary duties by refusing to negotiate with Air Products, failing to seek more valuable alternatives and failing to redeem the Companys shareholder rights plan.
F-40 Table of Contents AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Air Products also initiated a proxy contest to elect three directors to Airgas Board and to amend certain provisions of the Companys By-Laws. At the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company on September15, 2010, the three nominees of Air Products were elected to the Companys Board of Directors and a majority of the shares voted, though less than 67% of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote, were voted in favor of the By-Law amendments proposed by Air Products. Airgas and certain of its directors initiated an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that the By-Law amendment requiring that an annual meeting be held on January18, 2011, only four months after the September15, 2010 annual meeting, was invalid under both Delaware law and Airgas charter. In a ruling dated October8, 2010, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that the By-Law amendment was valid. Airgas and the directors involved appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court of Delaware and on November23, 2010, the Supreme Court of Delaware found that the By-Law amendment was invalid and reversed the judgment of the Court of Chancery.
On February15, 2011, the Delaware Court of Chancery denied in their entirety all requests for relief by Air Products and by the plaintiffs in the stockholder class action lawsuits, and dismissed with prejudice all claims asserted against the Company and its directors. Air Products promptly terminated its unsolicited tender offer and no appeal of the Courts decision was filed by Air Products or the stockholder plaintiffs.
Since February 2010, the Company has incurred $67.8 million of legal and professional fees and other costs related to Air Products unsolicited takeover attempt and the related litigation, of which $44.4 million was incurred during the year ended March31, 2011.
(24) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On May17, 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share. The dividend is payable June30, 2011 to stockholders of record as of June15, 2011.
On May5, 2011, the Company announced another program to repurchase up to $300 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. As of May4, 2011, Airgas had approximately 79.8million common shares outstanding. Airgas may repurchase shares from time to time for cash in open market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The Company will determine the timing and the amount of any repurchases based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. The stock repurchase program will be funded under the Companys existing Credit Facility, has no pre-established closing date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
