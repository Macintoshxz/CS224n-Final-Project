Company History We were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives. During the 1960s, we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities. During the 1970s and again during the 1990s, we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly, spending approximately $1billion in each of these decades.
We operated as a traditional supply cooperative until 2002, when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective, rather than assured supply to our owners. A critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace.
In August 2005, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In connection with the IPO, we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our pre-IPO owners' equity interests in CFIndustries, Inc., now our wholly-owned subsidiary, were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock.
In April 2010, we acquired Terra Industries Inc. (Terra), a leading North American producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of $4.6billion, which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock. Terra's financial results have been included in our consolidated financial results and in the nitrogen segment results since the acquisition date of April5, 2010. As a result of the Terra acquisition, we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities, our 75.3% interest in TNCLP and certain joint venture interests.

We operate seven nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in North America. We are 100% owners of these production facilities; four in the Central United States and one in Ontario, Canada. We also have a 75.3% interest in TNCLP and its subsidiary, TNLP, which owns a nitrogen fertilizer facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma, and a 66% economic interest in CFL, a variable interest entity that owns the nitrogen fertilizer complex in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada. In 2011, the combined production capacity of these seven facilities represented approximately 39% of North American ammonia capacity, 35% of North American dry urea capacity, 47% of North American UAN capacity and 22% of North American ammonium nitrate products capacity. Each of our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in North America has on-site storage to provide flexibility to manage the flow of outbound shipments without impacting production.
Our joint venture interests in PLNL and GrowHow provide additional production capacity in three additional nitrogen fertilizer production facilities, one located in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and two located in the United Kingdom.

This facility has the capacity to produce 720,000tons of ammonia annually from natural gas supplied under a contract with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago.
United Kingdom GrowHow is a 50/50 joint venture between us and Yara International ASA (Yara) that owns and operates the Ince and Billingham facilities. The Ince facility is located in northwestern England and consists of an ammonia plant, three nitric acid plants, an AN plant and three fertilizer compound plants. The Billingham facility located in the Teesside chemical area, is geographically split among two primary areas: the main site contains an ammonia plant, three nitric acid plants and a carbon dioxide plant and the Portrack site, approximately two miles away, contains an AN fertilizer plant.
Nitrogen Fertilizer Raw Materials Natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities. In 2011, natural gas accounted for approximately 45% of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers and a higher percentage of cash production costs (total production costs less depreciation and amortization). Our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities access abundant, competitively-priced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities. We have facilities 6 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
located at or near Henry Hub in Louisiana, Oneok in Oklahoma, AECO in Alberta, Ventura in Iowa and Dawn in Ontario.
Our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consume, in the aggregate, in excess of 250million MMBtus of natural gas annually. We employ a combination of spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable, competitively-priced supply of natural gas. We also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices. For further information about our natural gas hedging activities, see Note28Derivative Financial Instruments.
Nitrogen Fertilizer Distribution The safe, efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations. Our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer to terminals, warehouses and customers. Each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on production capability and location.
Our North American production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and our storage facilities in the U.S. and Canada, with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5,100 tank and hopper cars, as well as railcars provided by rail carriers.
The North American waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our Donaldsonville, Verdigris and Yazoo City facilities. We employ a fleet of ten leased tow boats and 32 river barges to ship ammonia and UAN. We also utilize contract marine services to move urea and phosphate fertilizers.
Three of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia. The Donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2,000-mile long Nustar pipeline through which we transport ammonia to over 20 terminals and shipping points located in the Midwestern U.S. Corn Belt. Our Verdigris and Port Neal facilities are connected to the 1,100-mile long Magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the U.S. Midwest.
Phosphate Segment We are a major manufacturer of phosphate fertilizer products. Our main phosphate fertilizer products are DAP and MAP. We also sold potash fertilizer in 2009 but have ceased sales of this product. Potash results are included in the phosphate segment.
Our historical sales of phosphate fertilizer products are shown in the table below.

Gross margin for the phosphate segment was $332.4million, $152.8million and $55.2million for the fiscal years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Total assets for the phosphate segment were $696.4million and $618.3million as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Our phosphate fertilizer manufacturing operations are located in central Florida and consist of a phosphate fertilizer chemical complex in Plant City, a phosphate rock mine, a beneficiation plant and phosphate rock reserves in Hardee County and a deepwater terminal facility in the port of Tampa. We own each of these facilities and properties.
The following table summarizes our phosphate fertilizer production volumes for the last three years and current production capacities for phosphate-related products.

(2) Capacities shown for phosphate rock at the Hardee County Phosphate Rock Mine and DAP/MAP granulation at the Plant City facility are constrained by Plant City's capacity to produce phosphoric acid.
Hardee County Phosphate Rock Mine In 1975, we purchased 20,000acres of land in Hardee County, Florida that was originally estimated to contain in excess of 100million tons of recoverable rock reserves. Between 1978 and 1993, we operated a one million ton per year phosphate rock mine on a 5,000-acre portion of these reserves. In 1995, we began operations at an expanded mine on the remaining 15,000-acre area of the reserve property. Since that time, we have acquired additional rock reserves through acquisitions or exchanges of several smaller parcels of land.
The table below shows the estimated reserves at the Hardee phosphate complex as of December31, 2011. Also reflected in the table is the grade of the reserves, expressed as a percentage of bone phosphate of lime (BPL) and P 2 O 5 . The table also reflects the average values of the following material contaminants contained in the reserves: ferrous oxide (Fe 2 O 3 ) plus aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) and magnesium oxide (MgO).

(2) The reserve estimates provided have been developed by the Company in accordance with Industry Guide7 promulgated by the SEC. We estimate that 99% of the reserves are proven.
Our phosphate reserve estimates are based on geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff geologist as of December31, 2011. Reserve estimates are updated periodically to reflect actual phosphate rock recovered, new drilling information and other geological or mining data. Estimates for 99% of the reserves are based on 20-acre density drilling.
Plant City Phosphate Complex Our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex is one of the largest phosphate fertilizer facilities in North America. At one million tons per year, its phosphoric acid capacity represents approximately 10% of the total U.S. capacity. All of Plant City's phosphoric acid is converted into ammonium phosphates (DAP and MAP), representing approximately 14% of U.S. capacity for ammonium phosphate fertilizer products in 2011. The combination of the Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex and the Hardee mine gives us one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer operations in North America.
Bartow Phosphate Complex We own a former phosphate manufacturing complex in Bartow, Florida that ceased production in 1999. The former manufacturing facilities have since been dismantled and disposed of in accordance with local laws and regulations. The phosphogypsum stack has been closed and the former storage and distribution facilities were sold along with excess land. We continue to be obligated for the closure of the cooling pond, management of water treatment on the site and providing long-term care for the site in accordance with regulatory requirements.
Phosphate Raw Materials Phosphate Rock Supply.
Phosphate rock is the basic nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers. Approximately 3.5tons of phosphate rock are needed to produce one ton of P 2 O 5 (the measure of nutrient content of phosphate fertilizers). Our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex typically consumes in excess of three million tons of rock annually. As of December31, 2011, our Hardee rock mine had approximately 13years of fully permitted recoverable phosphate reserves remaining at current operating rates. We have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area at our Hardee property where we can mine. The expanded area has an estimated 34million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves. We estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our Hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates, assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area.
9 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Sulfur Supply.
Sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid, which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid. Approximately three quarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of P 2 O 5 . Our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex uses approximately 800,000 long tons of sulfur annually when operating at capacity. We obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers under contracts of varied duration. In 2011, Martin Sulphur, our largest molten sulfur supplier, supplied approximately 60% of the molten sulfur used at Plant City.
Ammonia Supply.
DAP and MAP have a nitrogen content of 18% and 11%, respectively, and a phosphate nutrient content of 46% and 52%, respectively. Ammonia is the primary source of nitrogen in DAP and MAP. Operating at capacity, our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex consumes approximately 400,000tons of ammonia annually.
The ammonia used at our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex is shipped by rail from our ammonia storage facility located in Tampa, Florida. This facility consists of a 38,000-ton ammonia storage tank, access to a deep-water dock that is capable of discharging ocean-going vessels, and rail and truck loading facilities. In addition to supplying our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex, our Tampa ammonia distribution system has the capacity to support ammonia sales to, and distribution services for other customers. Sales of ammonia from our Tampa terminal are reported in our nitrogen business segment. The ammonia supply for Tampa is purchased from offshore sources, providing us with access to the broad international ammonia market.
Phosphate Distribution We operate a phosphate fertilizer warehouse located at a deep-water port facility in Tampa, Florida. Most of the phosphate fertilizer produced at Plant City is shipped by truck or rail to our Tampa warehouse, where it is loaded onto vessels for shipment to export customers or for transport across the Gulf of Mexico to the Mississippi River. In 2011, our Tampa warehouse handled approximately 1.3million tons of phosphate fertilizers, or about 66% of our production. The remainder of our phosphate fertilizer production is transported by truck or rail directly to customers or to in-market storage facilities.
Phosphate fertilizer shipped across the Gulf of Mexico to the Mississippi River is transferred into river barges near New Orleans. Phosphate fertilizer in these river barges is transported to our storage facilities or delivered directly to customers. River transportation is provided primarily under an agreement with one of the major inland river system barge operators.

We utilize Keytrade as our exclusive exporter of phosphate fertilizers from North America and importer of UAN products into North America. Profits resulting from sales or purchases with Keytrade are eliminated until realized by Keytrade or us, respectively. See Note19Equity Method Investments.
11 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
CHS, Inc. (CHS), GROWMARK, Inc. (GROWMARK), and Gavilon Fertilizer LLC are significant customers of both the nitrogen and phosphate segments. A loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and the individual results of each segment.
Competition Our markets are intensely competitive, based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality. During the peak demand periods, product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers.
In our nitrogen segment, our primary North American-based competitors include Agrium and Koch Nitrogen Fertilizers. There is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world, including some with lower natural gas costs. Because ammonia, urea and UAN are widely-traded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry, we experience competition from foreign-sourced products continuously.
In our phosphate segment, our primary North American-based competitors include Agrium, Mosaic, Potash Corp. and Simplot. The domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the world's largest exporter of DAP/MAP. Consequently, phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for U.S. DAP/MAP are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market, including fertilizer and/or trade policies of foreign governments, changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations.
Seasonality The sales patterns of all six of our major products are seasonal. The strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and/or our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.
Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Sales and Operations The amount of net sales attributable to our sales to foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying value of our foreign and domestic assets are set forth in Note33Segment Disclosures.
Environment, Health and Safety We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation; the generation, treatment, storage, disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes; and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases. These laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Toxic Substances Control Act and various other federal, state, provincial, local and international statutes. Violations can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability, without 12 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
regard to fault, for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment.
Environmental Health and Safety Expenditures Our environmental, health and safety capital expenditures in 2011 totaled approximately $13.2million. In 2012, we estimate that we will spend approximately $79.5million for environmental, health and safety capital expenditures. The increase in expenditures in 2012 is primarily related to certain projects to reduce emissions from our facilities, including projects related to the Consent Decrees that the company has entered into, and to improve the storage tank integrity and capacity at certain plant locations. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations. Such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
RCRA Enforcement Initiative (Plant City Consent Decree) In the third quarter of 2010, we executed a Consent Decree (Plant City Consent Decree) with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) with respect to the Company's Florida phosphate fertilizer complex and its compliance with RCRA. For additional information on the Plant City Consent Decree, see Note12Asset Retirement Obligations.
Nitric Acid Consent Decree In August 2007, Terra received a request for information from the EPA pursuant to Section114 of the Clean Air Act with respect to the nitric acid plant at Port Neal, Iowa. Subsequently, a proposal was made to the EPA to resolve a number of potential Clean Air Act violations associated with prior modifications at Terra's other nitric acid plants. On April19, 2011, a consent decree with the United States, Iowa, Mississippi and Oklahoma was lodged with the court and the consent decree became effective on June29, 2011. The consent decree requires the Company to achieve compliance with significantly lower nitrogen oxide emission standards. Compliance with these emission limits will require new or upgraded selective catalytic reduction systems and continuous emission monitors which have an estimated capital cost of approximately $15.0million.
Clean Air ActSection185 Fee Our Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex is located in a five-parish region near Baton Rouge, Louisiana that, as of 2005, was designated as being in "severe" nonattainment with respect to the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for ozone (the "1-hour ozone standard") pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (the Act). Section185 of the Act requires states, in their state implementation plans, to levy a fee (Section185 fee) on major stationary sources (such as the Donaldsonville facility) located in a severe nonattainment area that did not meet the 1-hour ozone standard by November30, 2005. For additional information on the Section185 fee, see Note32Contingencies.
Clean Air Act Information Request On February26, 2009, the Company received a letter from the EPA under Section114 of the Federal Clean Air Act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with New Source Review and New Source Performance Standards at the Donaldsonville facility. For additional information on the Clean Air Act Information Request, see Note32Contingencies.

Clean Air Act Investigation.
By letter dated June16, 2010, the Company received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA alleging violations of the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Clean Air Act regulations relating to certain projects undertaken at the Company's sulfuric acid plants at its Plant City, Florida facility. For additional information on the Clean Air Act Investigation, see Legal ProceedingsEnvironmental and Note32Contingencies.
EPCRA/CERCLA Investigation By letter dated July6, 2010, the EPA issued to the Company a NOV alleging violations of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-know Act (EPCRA) and CERCLA. For additional information on the EPCRA/CERCLA Investigation, see Legal ProceedingsEnvironmental and Note32Contingencies.
CERCLA/Remediation Matters From time to time, we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under CERCLA or other environmental cleanup laws. In 2002 and in 2009, we were asked by the current owner of a former phosphate mine and processing facility that we are alleged to have operated in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in Georgetown Canyon, Idaho, to contribute to a remediation of this property. For additional information on the CERCLA/Remediation matters, see Note32Contingencies.
Federal Numeric Nutrient Criteria Regulation On August18, 2009, the EPA entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in Florida. The consent decree was approved by a Federal district court judge on November16, 2009. The EPA adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for Florida lakes and inland flowing waters on November14, 2010. On February18, 2012, the Court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation, but found that the EPA had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious. The Court ordered the EPA to issue proposed or final numeric nutrient criteria for streams by May21, 2012 (subject to the EPA seeking an extension of such time period pursuant to the terms of the 2009 consent decree). Depending on the developments discussed herein, federal or state numeric water quality criteria for lakes and inland flowing waters could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining, manufacturing and distribution operations in Florida.
The federal criteria for lakes and inland flowing waters (excluding the criteria found arbitrary and capricious by the Court) will become effective in March 2012, subject to (i)the EPA's proposed delay in the effective date of the regulation (which may require the approval of the Court) and (ii)the development of numeric nutrient criteria by the State of Florida.
Prior to the February18, 2012 order, the EPA had proposed to stay the effective date of its criteria until June4, 2012 due to the development of numeric nutrient criteria proposed by the State of Florida in December 2011. However, the Court's order stated that the Court must approve an extension of the effective date of the federal rule pursuant to the terms of the consent decree. The nitrogen and phosphorous criteria in the December 2011 rule proposed by the State of Florida are substantially identical to the federal rule, but the state proposal includes biological verification as a component of the criteria and adopts existing nutrient Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) as applicable numeric criteria. The impact of these modifications could be to provide more flexibility with respect to nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits so long as such discharges do not impair the biological health of receiving water bodies. Environmental groups have filed a 14 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
challenge to the proposed state rule with the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings, which will be reviewed by an administrative law judge in early 2012. If the state numeric criteria are promulgated and approved subsequently by the EPA, the state criteria would result in EPA withdrawing the federal numeric criteria.
The 2009 consent decree also requires the EPA to develop numeric nutrient criteria for Florida coastal and estuarine waters. The development of such criteria has been delayed. The EPA has announced its intention to issue proposed numeric nutrient criteria for these water bodies by March 2012 and a final rule by November 2012. It is unclear the extent to which the February18, 2012 decision will impact this proposed rule. The numeric criteria proposed by the State of Florida, discussed above, include criteria for coastal and estuarine waters and if finally promulgated by the State and approved by the EPA, would also supplant federal standards for such water bodies.
The numeric nutrient criteria regulation is not yet final. However, more stringent limits on wastewater discharge permits could increase our costs or limit our operations and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Regulation of Greenhouse Gasses We are subject to regulations in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States concerning climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
The United Kingdom is a party to the Kyoto Protocol. As a result of agreements reached during a conference in Durban, South Africa, the Kyoto Protocol will continue in force for a second commitment period, which will expire by 2020, to be replaced by another international agreement to be negotiated by 2015 (which agreement is to go into effect in 2020). The United Kingdom has adopted GHG emissions regulations, including regulations to implement the European Union Greenhouse Gas Trading System. Our joint venture U.K. manufacturing plants are required to report GHG emissions annually to the United Kingdom Environment Agency pursuant to their site Environmental Permits and Climate Change Agreement, which specify energy efficiency targets. Failure to meet efficiency targets may require the joint venture to purchase CO 2 emissions allowances. The steam boilers at each of our joint venture U.K. sites are also subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. More stringent GHG emission limits in the U.K and Europe are expected to go into effect beginning in 2013.
In Canada (which in December 2011 withdrew from further participation in the Kyoto Protocol, but signed the Durban platform to negotiate a new international greenhouse gas agreement or protocol by 2015), we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with Environment Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory and Ontario's Mandatory Monitoring and Reporting Regulation and the GHG Reporting Regulation. Ontario is also a party to the Western Climate Initiative, comprised of California (the other states in the initiative having withdrawn) and several Canadian provinces, which intends to establish a cap and trade regime for the trading of GHG credits within the regional area (ostensibly to begin in 2013, with 2012 functioning as a transition year). Although Ontario has not disavowed its participation in the initiative, it has not developed regulations to establish a cap and trade program.
In the United States (not a party to the Kyoto Protocol, but a signatory to the Durban platform with respect to the negotiation of a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol), GHG regulation is evolving at state, regional and federal levels. Although there were federal legislative developments in the 111 th Congress, including the passage of a comprehensive climate change bill in the House of Representatives, efforts to pass such legislation have ceased. However, the EPA issued federal GHG regulations that impact our facilities, including a mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule that required all of our U.S. manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring GHG emissions beginning on January1, 2010 and begin reporting the previous year's emissions annually starting in 2011. In May 2010, the EPA issued the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V Greenhouse Gas 15 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Tailoring Rule (Tailoring Rule). This regulation establishes that the construction of new or modification of existing major sources of GHG emissions would become subject to the PSD air permitting program (and later, the Title V permitting program) beginning in January 2011, although the regulation also significantly increases the emissions thresholds that would subject facilities to these regulations. This regulation (along with other GHG regulations and determinations issued by the EPA) is currently subject to judicial appeal. Regulation of GHG emissions pursuant to the PSD program could subject new capital projects to additional permitting requirements that may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects.
Under the Title V provisions of the Tailoring Rule, all of our U.S. manufacturing facilities will be required to include GHG emissions in future air emissions inventory reports. Other than the states' implementation of the Tailoring Rule, none of the states where our U.S. production facilities are locatedFlorida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Iowa and Oklahomahas proposed regulations limiting GHG emissions. Iowa is a member of the Midwest Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, signed in 2007, but the member states appear to have discontinued any action to implement the accord.
Proposed Revisions to New Source Performance Standards for Nitric Acid Plants.
In October 2011, the EPA issued a proposed regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed, reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants. We operate 13 nitric acid plants in the United States. The regulations, when finalized, will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications, including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants. The proposed regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the proposed limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants, and accordingly, the proposed regulation, if finalized as is, could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants. Although the proposed EPA regulation did not include a proposed limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide (a greenhouse gas), comments have been submitted urging EPA to include such limits in the final regulation. The final regulation is expected to be issued in 2012.
Regulatory Permits and Approvals We hold numerous environmental and mining permits authorizing operations at our facilities. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. Any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals.
As of December31, 2011, the area permitted for mining at our Hardee phosphate complex had approximately 45.9million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves, which we expect to meet our requirements, at current production rates, for approximately 13years. We have secured the necessary permits to mine these reserves from the FDEP and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. We have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our Hardee property. The expanded geographical area has an estimated additional 34million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves, which we expect will allow us to conduct mining operations at our Hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates, assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area. The estimated recoverable phosphate reserves are reflective of the anticipated permittable mining areas based on recent similar permitting efforts. In Florida, local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies. A denial of the authorizations or permits to continue and/or expand our mining operations at our Hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
16 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
We have secured the state environmental authorization to increase the capacity of our phosphogypsum stack system at Plant City. With the completion of our current expansion project, this stack has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2026 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits. Including additional expansion phases, the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits. This date is approximately six years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our Hardee mine. A decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In certain cases, as a condition to procuring such permits and approvals, we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements. The purpose of these requirements is to assure that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure, post-closure care and/or reclamation at our facilities. We currently utilize a trust established for the benefit of the EPA and the FDEP and an escrow account established for the benefit of the FDEP as a means of complying with financial assurance requirements for the closure and long-term care of our phosphogypsum stack systems. For additional information on the cash deposit arrangements, see Note12Asset Retirement Obligations.
Several of our permits, including our mining permit at the Hardee phosphate complex, require us to reclaim any property disturbed by our operations. At our Hardee property, we currently mine approximately 300 to 500acres of land each year, all of which must be reclaimed. The costs to reclaim this land vary based on the type of land involved and range from $3,700 to $18,200 an acre, with an average of $9,600 an acre. For additional information on our Hardee asset retirement obligations, see Note12Asset Retirement Obligations.
Our phosphate operations in Florida are subject to regulations governing the closure and long-term maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems. At our Bartow phosphate complex, we estimate that we will spend a total of approximately $3million between 2012 and 2016 to complete closure of the cooling pond and channels. Water treating expenditures at Bartow are estimated to require about $12million over the next 45years. Post-closure long-term care expenditures at Bartow are estimated to total approximately $51million for a 51year period including 2012. To close the phosphogypsum stack currently in use at the Plant City phosphate complex, we estimate that we will spend approximately $65million during the years 2033 through 2037, and another $45million in 2087 to close the cooling pond. Water treating expenditures at Plant City are estimated to approximate $6million in 2018, $64million in 2033 through 2037, and $166million thereafter through 2087. Post-closure long-term care expenditures at Plant City are estimated to total $106million for a 50year period commencing in 2038. These amounts are in nominal dollars using an assumed inflation rate of 3%.
Cost estimates for closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems are based on formal closure plans submitted to the State of Florida, which are subject to revision during negotiations over the next several years. Moreover, the time frame involved in the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems extends as far as the year 2087. Accordingly, the actual amount to be spent also will depend upon factors such as the timing of activities, refinements in scope, technological developments, cost inflation and changes in applicable laws and regulations. These cost estimates may also increase if the Plant City phosphogypsum stack is expanded further. For additional information on asset retirement obligations related to our phosphogypsum systems, see Note12Asset Retirement Obligations.
Employees and Labor Relations As of December31, 2011, we employed approximately 2,400 full-time and 100 part-time employees.

ITEM1A.RISK FACTORS.
In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form10-K, you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities. These risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business is dependent on North American natural gas, the prices of which are subject to volatility.
Natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, urea, UAN, AN and other nitrogen products. Because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Canada, North American natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our nitrogen fertilizers.
The price of natural gas in North America has been highly volatile in recent years. During 2011, the average daily closing price at the Henry Hub, the most heavily-traded natural gas pricing basis in North America, reached a high of $4.92 per MMBtu on June9, 2011 and a low of $2.83 per MMBtu on November23, 2011.
Changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can also lead to periods of high natural gas prices. If this were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
The price we pay for natural gas in the future may be higher than prices paid by producers in certain other fertilizer-producing regions of the world, which may make it more difficult for us to compete against these producers.
Our business is cyclical, resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our results of operations tend to be negatively impacted.
Historically, selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions. Demand is affected by population growth, changes in dietary habits, non-food usage of crops, such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels, and planted acreage and application rates, among other things. Supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs and availability, government policies and global trade.
Periods of high demand, high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity, which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline. Future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacity.
During periods of industry oversupply, our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines, resulting in possible reduced profit margins, write-downs in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production.
Our products are global commodities, and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers.
We are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources. Fertilizers are global commodities, with little or no product differentiation, and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and 18 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
product quality. We compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers, including state-owned and government-subsidized entities.
Some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales, which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities. Our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships.
China, the world's largest producer and consumer of fertilizers, is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capability. If Chinese policy encourages exports, this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
We may face increased competition from Russian and Ukrainian urea and ammonium nitrate. Urea imports from Russia and Ukraine are currently subject to antidumping orders that impose duties (ranging from approximately one percent to 68percent) on urea imported into the United States from these two countries. Russia and Ukraine currently have considerable capacity to produce urea and are the world's largest urea exporters. In Russia, the price for natural gas used for industrial production continues to be set by the government and is below its market value. Russian nitrogen fertilizer producers benefit from these government-controlled prices, encouraging inefficient urea production and high volumes of exports. In Ukraine, the government intervenes with respect to natural gas prices available to fertilizer producers so as to permit continued exports. The antidumping orders have been in place since 1987, and there has been very little urea imported into the United States from Russia or Ukraine since that time. The U.S. Department of Commerce regularly reviews the U.S. sales of urea made by Russian exporters. In October 2011, the U.S. Department of Commerce completed its most recent review of U.S. sales made by the Russian exporter EuroChem and concluded that duties of approximately one percent should be imposed. This low rate of duty may result in increased imports of low-priced Russian urea into the United States.
In 2011, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission conducted the third "sunset review" of the urea antidumping orders to determine whether they should be kept in place for an additional five years. The review has resulted in a decision to leave the orders in place for another five years, and the next sunset review is not expected to be initiated until late 2016.
Russia is by far the world's largest ammonium nitrate producer and exporter. As in the case of urea, Russian ammonium nitrate producers benefit from below-market pricing of natural gas. Fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from Russia is subject to an antidumping duty order, which currently imposes antidumping duties of 253.98percent on Russian ammonium nitrate imports into the United States. In May 2011, this order replaced a longstanding "suspension agreement" which had imposed volume and pricing restrictions on Russian ammonium nitrate imports. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission completed the second "sunset review" of the Russian ammonium nitrate antidumping order and concluded that it will remain in effect for at least another five years. Fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from Ukraine is also subject to an antidumping duty order under which imports of this product are currently subject to a duty of over 156percent. That order is expected to be reviewed beginning in June 2012.
19 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
A decline in U.S. agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products.
Conditions in the U.S. agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results. The U.S. agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors, including weather patterns and field conditions, current and projected grain inventories and prices, domestic and international demand for U.S. agricultural products and U.S. and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products. These factors are outside of our control.
State and federal governmental policies, including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs, as well as the prices of fertilizer products, may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted, the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications. In recent years, for example, ethanol production in the United States has increased significantly due, in part, to federal legislation mandating greater use of renewable fuels. This increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the United States and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics. While the current Renewable Fuels Standard, or RFS, encourages continued high levels of corn-based ethanol production, a continuing "food versus fuel" debate and other factors have resulted in calls to reduce subsidies for ethanol, allow increased ethanol imports and adopt temporary waivers of the current RFS levels, any of which could have an adverse effect on corn-based ethanol production, planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand. Developments in crop technology, such as nitrogen fixation, the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate, could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products. In addition, from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment.
Our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers, which subjects us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations.
We rely on railroad, trucking, pipeline, river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities, to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers. We also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products. These transportation operations, equipment and services are subject to various hazards, including extreme weather conditions, system failures, work stoppages, delays, accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards.
These transportation operations, equipment and services are also subject to environmental, safety, and regulatory oversight. Due to concerns related to accidents, terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives, local, state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of our raw materials or finished products.
If our shipping is delayed or if we are unable to ship our finished products or obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies' failure to operate properly, or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment, or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment, our sales revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, increases in our transportation costs, or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
The railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads' potential liability stemming from the transportation of Toxic Inhalation Hazard, or TIH, materials, such as the anhydrous ammonia 20 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities. These efforts by the railroads include (i)requesting that the Surface Transportation Board, or STB, issue a policy statement finding that it is reasonable for a railroad to require a shipper to indemnify the railroads and carry insurance for all liability above a certain amount arising from the transportation of TIH materials; (ii)requesting that the STB approve an increase in the maximum reasonable rates that a railroad can charge for the transportation of TIH materials; and (iii)lobbying for new legislation or regulations that would limit or eliminate the railroads' common carrier obligation to transport TIH materials. If the railroads were to succeed in one or more of these initiatives, it could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care, custody and control of the railroads.
New regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products. The Federal Railroad Administration is developing higher ammonia tank car performance standards, which could require the modification or replacement of our leased tank car fleet. The effective date of these new regulations is not known at this time. However, the Federal Railroad Administration has approved an "interim" car design for a 20year period. In 2010, we contracted to switch a significant portion of our leased fleet over the next 5years to this "interim" car. Standards higher than those of the "interim" cars could adversely impact our cost of operations and our ability to obtain an adequate supply of rail cars to support our operations.
Integrating the information management systems of CFIndustries and Terra is continuing. Integration difficulties or cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results.
CFIndustries continues to utilize legacy Terra's separate information management systems to process transactions governing core business operations of the legacy Terra plants. To fully integrate the Terra operations into CFIndustries business processes and to achieve additional benefits of the acquisition, CFIndustries is undertaking a project to consolidate all business processes for the combined companies under a new single enterprise resource planning (ERP) system utilizing software provided by SAP. This multi-year company-wide program will align business processes and procedures, institute more efficient transaction processing and improve access to and consistency of information to enable standardization of business activities. We expect to implement this system in 2012. The implementation of an ERP system across the combined organization entails certain risks. If we do not implement the system successfully and within the planned budget, or if the system does not perform in a satisfactory manner, it could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
As we continue to increase our dependence on digital technologies to conduct our operations, the risks associated with cyber security also increase. We rely on management information systems, among other things, to manage our accounting, manufacturing, supply chain and financial functions. This risk not only applies to us, but also to third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business. We have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our information from being vulnerable to theft, loss, damage or interruption from a number of potential sources or events. We believe these measures and procedures are appropriate. However, we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Compromises to information system could have severe financial and other business implications.

Adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products and increase the cost of natural gas.
Weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer, which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season, resulting in lower demand for our products.
Adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall. Weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields, which lowers the income of growers and could impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.
Weather conditions or, in certain cases, weather forecasts, also can affect the price of natural gas, our principal raw material used to make nitrogen based fertilizers. Colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand of natural gas for residential and industrial use. In addition, hurricanes affecting the Gulf coastal states can severely impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise sharply.
Expansion of our business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences.
We routinely consider possible expansions of our business, both domestically and in foreign locations. Major investments in our business, including as a result of acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or other major investments require significant managerial resources, which may be diverted from our other activities and may impair the operation of our businesses. The risks of any expansion of our business through investments, acquisitions, partnerships or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion, which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented. As a result of these and other factors, including general economic risk, we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or other investments.
We are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, as well as potential environmental liabilities, which may require us to make substantial expenditures.
We are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation; the generation, treatment, storage, disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes; the cleanup of hazardous substance releases, and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure. In the United States, these laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, RCRA, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, CERCLA, the Toxic Substances Control Act and various other federal, state, provincial, local and international statutes.
As a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances, our business is inherently subject to spills, discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Certain environmental laws, including CERCLA, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment. Given the nature of our business, we have incurred, are incurring currently, and are likely to incur periodically in the future, liabilities under CERCLA and other environmental cleanup laws at our current or former facilities, adjacent or nearby third-party facilities or offsite disposal locations. The costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be 22 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
material. Additionally, we may become liable to third parties for damages, including personal injury and property damage, resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment.
Violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. Environmental and health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time. As a result, we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Additionally, future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures. Additionally, our costs to comply with, or any liabilities under, these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
From time to time, our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury. To date, our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material, however, we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us, or if our carrier refuses coverage for these losses.
On August18, 2009, the EPA entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in Florida. The consent decree was approved by a Federal district court judge on November16, 2009. The EPA adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for Florida lakes and inland flowing waters on November14, 2010. On February18, 2012, the Court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation, but found that the EPA had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious. The Court ordered the EPA to issue proposed or final numeric nutrient criteria for streams by May21, 2012 (subject to the EPA seeking an extension of such time period pursuant to the terms of the 2009 consent decree). Depending on the developments discussed herein, federal or state numeric water quality criteria for lakes and inland flowing waters could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining, manufacturing and distribution operations in Florida.
The federal criteria for lakes and inland flowing waters (excluding the criteria found arbitrary and capricious by the Court) will become effective in March 2012, subject to (i)the EPA's proposed delay in the effective date of the regulation (which may require the approval of the Court) and (ii)the development of numeric nutrient criteria by the State of Florida.
Prior to the February18, 2012 order, the EPA had proposed to stay the effective date of its criteria until June4, 2012 due to the development of numeric nutrient criteria proposed by the State of Florida in December 2011. However, the Court's order stated that the Court must approve an extension of the effective date of the federal rule pursuant to the terms of the consent decree. The nitrogen and phosphorous criteria in the December 2011 rule proposed by the State of Florida are substantially identical to the federal rule, but the state proposal includes biological verification as a component of the criteria and adopts existing nutrient Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) as applicable numeric criteria. The impact of these modifications could be to provide more flexibility with respect to nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits so long as such discharges do not impair the biological health of receiving water bodies. Environmental groups have filed a challenge to the proposed state rule with the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings, which will be reviewed by an administrative law judge in early 2012. If the state numeric criteria are promulgated and approved subsequently by the EPA, the state criteria would result in EPA withdrawing the federal numeric criteria.
23 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
The 2009 consent decree also requires the EPA to develop numeric nutrient criteria for Florida coastal and estuarine waters. The development of such criteria has been delayed. The EPA has announced its intention to issue proposed numeric nutrient criteria for these water bodies by March 2012 and a final rule by November 2012. It is unclear the extent to which the February18, 2012 decision will impact this proposed rule. The numeric criteria proposed by the State of Florida, discussed above, include criteria for coastal and estuarine waters and if finally promulgated by the State and approved by the EPA, would also supplant federal standards for such water bodies.
The numeric nutrient criteria regulation is not yet final. However, more stringent limits on wastewater discharge permits could increase our costs or limit our operations and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations are dependent on numerous required permits, approvals and meeting financial assurance requirements from governmental authorities.
We hold numerous environmental, mining and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. Expansion of our operations is dependent upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In certain cases, as a condition to procure such permits and approvals or as a condition to maintain existing approvals, we may be required to comply with regulatory financial assurance requirements. The purpose of these requirements is to assure local, state or federal government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure, post-closure care and reclamation at our facilities. For example, in 2006, we established an escrow account for the benefit of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) as a means of complying with Florida's regulations governing financial assurance related to closure and post-closure of phosphogypsum stacks. Also, in 2010, pursuant to a Consent Decree with the U.S. EPA and the FDEP, we funded a trust as a means of complying with similar requirements for closure, post closure and monitoring of the phosphogypsum stack system at our Plant City, Florida phosphate fertilizer complex.
Florida regulations also mandate payment of certain mining taxes based on the quantity of ore mined and are subject to change based on local regulatory approvals. Additional financial assurance requirements or other increases in local mining regulations and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Florida regulations also require phosphate rock mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities. If and when we are able to expand our Hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted, we will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities. The demonstration of financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests. In the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests, alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to expend funds for the purchase of bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies or similar instruments. It is possible that we will not be able to comply with either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
24 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
As of December31, 2011, the area permitted by local, state and federal authorities for mining at our Hardee phosphate complex contained approximately 45.9million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves, which will meet our requirements, at current operating rates, for approximately 13years. We have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our Hardee property. The expanded geographical area has an estimated 34million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves, which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our Hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates, assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area. In Florida, local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies. A denial of the authorizations or permits to continue or expand our mining operations at our Hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have secured the state environmental authorization to increase the capacity of our phosphogypsum stack system at Plant City. With the completion of our "PhaseII" expansion that is currently being constructed, this stack has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2026 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits. Including further expansion phases, the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits. This time frame is approximately six years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our Hardee mine. A decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
We are subject to climate change regulations in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. There are substantial uncertainties as to the nature, stringency and timing of future climate change regulations. More stringent greenhouse gas (GHG) limitations, if they are enacted, are likely to have significant impacts on the fertilizer industry due to the fact that our production facilities emit GHGs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Regulation of GHGs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs, reduce our efficiency, limit our output, require us to make capital improvements to our facilities, increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy, raw materials or transportation, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, to the extent that climate change restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than in the United States or Canada, our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us.
Our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess inventory, potentially at costs in excess of market value, or product shortages. Our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality.
The fertilizer business is seasonal. The degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors. The strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of 25 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season.
If seasonal demand is less than we expect, we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored (in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs) or liquidated (in which case the selling price may be below our production, procurement and storage costs). The risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are particularly acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer business because of the volatility of nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers. If prices rapidly decrease, we may be subject to inventory write-downs, causing an adverse change in operating results.
A change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
We offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis including under our Forward Pricing Program (FPP) at prices and delivery dates we propose. This improves our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allows us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing assets.
Under our FPP, customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and generally pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date, thereby significantly increasing our liquidity. Any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped, which can take up to several months, or more. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders equaled approximately 21% and 54%, respectively, of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
We believe the ability to purchase product on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers. Our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources. In periods of rising fertilizer prices, selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis. Conversely, in periods of declining fertilizer prices, selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis. In addition, fixing the selling prices of our products, often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment.
We also sell phosphate products on a forward basis, including under the FPP. In 2011, forward sales of phosphate fertilizer products represented approximately 50% of our phosphate fertilizer volume. Unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products where we have the opportunity to fix the cost of natural gas, we typically are unable to fix the cost of phosphate raw materials, such as sulfur and ammonia, which are among the largest components of our phosphate fertilizer costs. As a result, we are typically exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis.

Our business is subject to risks involving derivatives, including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses.
We manage commodity price risk for our business. Although we have risk measurement systems that use various methodologies to quantify the risk, these systems might not always be followed or might not always work as planned. Further, such risk measurement systems do not in themselves manage risk. Even if risks have been identified, our earnings, cash flows, and balance sheet could be adversely affected by changes involving volatility, changes involving adverse correlation of commodity prices, or market liquidity issues. Our ability to manage exposure to commodity price risk through the use of financial derivatives also may be affected by limitations imposed by the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness.
In order to manage financial exposure to commodity price and market fluctuations, we utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our exposure to the price volatility of natural gas, the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogen based fertilizers. In these hedging activities, we have used fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter, or OTC, markets or on exchanges. Nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract or industry. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist.
Our use of derivatives to lock in the natural gas portion of our margins on forward sales of nitrogen products can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives prior to the purchase of the natural gas.
Our natural gas acquisition policy also allows us to establish derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our forward sales. Holding such positions during periods of declining natural gas prices could expose us to cash collateral deposit requirements with counterparties, thereby negatively impacting our liquidity.
In addition, our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us. For example, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position. The counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions. We monitor the swap portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary. We also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties, established credit limits, cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements. However, our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on derivative settlements.
Our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards. We are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. Therefore, our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses.
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing, transportation, storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers, including ammonia, which is highly toxic and corrosive. These hazards include: explosions; fires; severe weather and natural disasters; train derailments, collisions, vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents; leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks, pipelines and rail cars; spills, discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases; deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents; mechanical failures; unscheduled downtime; labor difficulties and other risks. Some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities.
27 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
We maintain property, business interruption, casualty and liability insurance policies, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. If we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to various self-retentions, deductibles and limits under these insurance policies. The policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder. Our policies are generally renewed annually. As a result of market conditions, our premiums, self-retentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. In addition, significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce, or possibly eliminate, coverage.
We are reliant on a limited number of key facilities.
Our nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in seven separate nitrogen complexes, the largest of which is the Donaldsonville complex which represents approximately 40% of the Company's ammonia production capacity. Our phosphate fertilizer operations are dependent on our phosphate mine and associated beneficiation plant in Hardee County, Florida; our phosphate fertilizer complex in Plant City, Florida; and our ammonia terminal in Tampa, Florida. The suspension of operations at any of these key facilities could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments under our FPP, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a number of our key facilities, including the Donaldsonville complex and all of our phosphate operations, are located in regions of the United States that experience a relatively high level of hurricane activity. Such storms, depending on their severity and location, have the potential, not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations, but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas and sulfur in the Gulf of Mexico region.
We are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventures.
We participate in joint ventures including CFL (which owns our facility in Medicine Hat, Alberta), Point Lisas (which owns our facility in Trinidad), GrowHow (which owns our facilities in Billingham and Ince, United Kingdom) and Keytrade. Our joint venture partners may share or have majority control over the operations of our joint ventures. As a result, our investments in joint ventures involve risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently. These risks include the possibility that our joint ventures or our partners: have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our business interests or goals; are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or objectives; subject the joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated; take actions that reduce our return on investment; or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business.
In addition, we may become involved in disputes with our joint venture partners, which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture, which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs.
Acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business.
Like other companies with major industrial facilities, our plants and ancillary facilities may be targets of terrorist activities. Many of these plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other items that can be dangerous if mishandled. Any damage to infrastructure facilities, such as electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, or injury to employees, who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism, may affect our operations. Any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace, repair or insure our assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
28 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
In addition, due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives, local, state, federal and foreign governments could implement new regulations impacting the security of our plants, terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers. These regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs, lower revenues and reduced profit margins. We manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives, as was used in the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995. It is possible that the U.S. or foreign governments could impose limitations on the use, sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers, thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell that product.
Our operations are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and an increase in the price or any delay or interruption in the delivery of these raw materials may adversely affect our business.
We use natural gas, ammonia and sulfur as raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers. We purchase these raw materials from third-party suppliers. Prices for these raw materials can fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand. We may not be able to pass along to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. These products are transported by barge, truck, rail or pipeline to our facilities by third-party transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties. Any delays or interruptions in the delivery of these key raw materials, including those caused by capacity constraints; explosions; fires; severe weather and natural disasters; train derailments, collisions, vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents; leaks and ruptures involving pipelines; deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents; mechanical failures; unscheduled downtime; or labor difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
We are subject to risks associated with international operations.
Our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations; unexpected changes in regulatory environments; currency fluctuations; tax rates that may exceed those in the United States; earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements; and the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions. During 2011, we derived approximately 15% of our net sales from outside of the United States. Our business operations include a 50% interest in an ammonia production joint venture in Trinidad and a 50% interest in a U.K. joint venture for the production of anhydrous ammonia and other fertilizer products.
Our investments in securities are subject to risks that may result in losses.
Our cash flows from operations have resulted in cash and cash-equivalents of approximately $1.2billion as of December31, 2011. We generally invest these cash and cash-equivalents in what we believe to be relatively short-term, highly liquid and high credit quality instruments, including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds. Securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the U.S. government, those issued by state, local or other governmental entities, and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities. Our investments are subject to fluctuations in both market value and yield based upon changes in market conditions, including interest rates, liquidity, general economic and credit market conditions and conditions specific to the issuers.
Our efforts to manage investment risk could prove unsuccessful. For example, at December31, 2011, we held investments of $70.9million in tax-exempt auction rate securities. These securities were 29 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
issued by various state and local government entities and are all supported by student loans that were issued primarily under the Federal Family Loan Program. These auction rate securities have stated maturities that range up to 36years, and the underlying securities are guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities. Although redemptions have occurred sporadically, currently there is no active market for these investments and we continue to hold them until liquidity resumes in the marketplace or we recover our investment by other means.
Due to the risks of investments, we may not achieve expected returns or may realize losses on our investments which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.
Deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
A slowdown of, or persistent weakness in, economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways, among others: conditions in the credit markets could impact the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations; the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital; and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses. We also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers' reluctance to replenish inventories. The overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict, and our business could be materially adversely impacted.
In addition, conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizer significantly influence our operating results. The international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the U.S. dollar and its impact on the importation of fertilizers, foreign agricultural policies, the existence of, or changes in, import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and other regulatory policies of foreign governments, as well as the laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade and investment.
We have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness, or need to refinance existing indebtedness, in the future, which may adversely affect our operations.
As of December31, 2011, we had approximately $1.6billion of total indebtedness, consisting primarily of $800million of our senior notes due in 2018 and $800million of our senior notes due in 2020. We had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing revolving credit facility of approximately $491million. The terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future. Our existing indebtedness and any additional debt we may incur in the future could have important consequences on our business in adversely affecting our operations and liquidity. In addition, the terms of our revolving credit facility include covenants restricting our ability to engage in other business activities, including, among other things, making investments, making restricted payments and disposing of assets.
From time to time we consider our options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to obtain any financing, whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise, and the terms of any such financing are dependent on, among other things, our financial condition, financial market conditions within our industry and generally, credit ratings and numerous other factors. Consequently, in the event we need to access the credit markets, including to refinance our debt, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time, if at all. If we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us it could, in addition to other negative effects, have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.
The loss of key members of our management and professional staff may adversely affect our business.
We believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our senior management and professional staff. The loss of one or more key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, if we are unable to find, hire and retain needed key personnel in the future, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Environmental Clean Air Act Investigation On March19, 2007, the Company received a letter from the EPA under Section114 of the Federal Clean Air Act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with New Source Review, New Source Performance Standards, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants at the Plant City facility. The Company provided the requested information to the EPA in late 2007. The EPA initiated this same process in relation to numerous other sulfuric acid plants and phosphoric acid plants throughout the nation, including other facilities in Florida.
The Company received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA by letter dated June16, 2010. The NOV alleges the Company violated the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Clean Air Act regulations relating to certain projects undertaken at the Plant City facility's sulfuric acid plants. This NOV further alleges that the actions that are the basis for the alleged PSD violations also resulted in violations of Title V air operating permit regulations. Finally, the NOV alleges that the Company failed to comply with certain compliance dates established by hazardous air pollutant regulations for phosphoric acid manufacturing plants and phosphate fertilizer production plants. The Company had an initial meeting with the EPA to discuss these alleged violations. This matter has been referred to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). The Company does not know at this time if it will settle this matter prior to initiation of formal legal action.
We cannot estimate the potential penalties, fines or other expenditures, if any, that may result from the Clean Air Act NOV and, therefore, we cannot determine if the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
EPCRA/CERCLA Investigation Pursuant to a letter from the DOJ dated July28, 2008 that was sent to representatives of the major U.S. phosphoric acid manufacturers, including CFIndustries, the DOJ stated that it and the EPA 33 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
believe that apparent violations of Section313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires annual reports to be submitted with respect to the use of certain toxic chemicals, have occurred at all of the phosphoric acid facilities operated by these manufacturers. The letter also states that the DOJ and the EPA believe that most of these facilities have violated Section304 of EPCRA and Section103 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) by failing to provide required notifications relating to the release of hydrogen fluoride from these facilities. The letter did not specifically identify alleged violations at our Plant City, Florida complex or assert a claim for a specific amount of penalties. The EPA submitted an information request to the Company on February11, 2009, as a follow-up to the July 2008 letter. The Company provided information in response to the agency's inquiry on May14 and May29, 2009.
By letter dated July6, 2010, the EPA issued a NOV to the Company alleging violations of EPCRA and CERCLA. The Company had an initial meeting with the EPA to discuss these alleged violations. The Company does not know at this time if it will settle this matter prior to initiation of formal legal action.
We do not expect that penalties or fines, if any, that may arise out of the EPCRA/CERCLA matter will have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

All references to "CFHoldings," "we," "us" and "our" refer to CFIndustries Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including CFIndustries, Inc. except where the context makes clear that the reference is only to CFHoldings itself and not its subsidiaries. Footnotes referenced in this discussion and analysis refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements that are found in the following section: Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is an outline of the discussion and analysis included herein:  Overview of CFIndustries Holdings, Inc.
Our Company  Financial Executive Summary  Company History  Key Industry Factors  Factors Affecting Our Results  Results of Consolidated Operations  Operating Results by Business Segment  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  Discussion of Seasonality Impacts on Operations Overview of CFIndustries Holdings, Inc.
Our Company We are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products in the world. Our operations are organized into two business segmentsthe nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment. Our principal products in the nitrogen segment are ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution, or UAN, and ammonium nitrate, or AN. Our other nitrogen products include urea liquor, diesel exhaust fluid, or DEF, and aqua ammonia, which are sold primarily to our industrial customers. Our principal products in the phosphate segment are diammonium phosphate, or DAP, and monoammonium phosphate, or MAP.
Our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern United States and other major agricultural areas of the U.S. and Canada. We also export nitrogen fertilizer products from our Donaldsonville, Louisiana manufacturing facilities and phosphate fertilizer products from our Florida phosphate operations.
The principal customers for both our nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors.
Our principal assets include:  five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in Donaldsonville, Louisiana (the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in North America), Port Neal, Iowa, Courtright, Ontario, Yazoo City, Mississippi, and Woodward, Oklahoma; 38 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
a 75.3% interest in Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP), a publicly traded limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and the majority limited partner and which, through its subsidiary Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP), operates a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma;  a 66% economic interest in the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada (which we operate in Medicine Hat, Alberta through Canadian Fertilizers Limited (CFL), a consolidated variable interest entity);  one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer complexes in the United States in Plant City, Florida;  the most-recently constructed phosphate rock mine and associated beneficiation plant in the United States in Hardee County, Florida;  an extensive system of terminals and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States; and  joint venture investments that we account for under the equity method, which consist of:  a 50% interest in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited (PLNL), an ammonia production joint venture located in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago;  a 50% interest in GrowHow UK Limited (GrowHow), a nitrogen products production joint venture located in the United Kingdom and serving the British agricultural and industrial markets; and  a 50% interest in KEYTRADE AG (Keytrade), a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near Zurich, Switzerland.
In April 2010, we completed the acquisition of Terra Industries Inc. (Terra), a leading North American producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products, for a purchase price of $4.6billion. Terra's financial results have been included in our consolidated financial results and in the nitrogen segment results since the acquisition date of April5, 2010. Therefore, Terra's financial results are not included in the consolidated financial results for the first quarter of 2010. Further information regarding the acquisition of Terra, including the related issuance of long-term debt and the public offering of common shares of CFHoldings can be found in Notes14 and 29 to our consolidated financial statements included in PartII of this report and in the section titled "Acquisition of Terra" later in this discussion and analysis.
Financial Executive Summary  We reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $1.5billion in 2011 compared to $349.2million in 2010. Our results for 2011 included:  a net $77.3million pre-tax unrealized mark-to-market loss ($48.0million after tax) on natural gas derivatives;  a $34.8million pre-tax ($21.6million after tax) non-cash impairment charge related to our Woodward, Oklahoma methanol plant;  a $32.5million ($20.0million after tax) gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses;  $19.9million ($12.3million after tax) of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs recognized upon repayment of the remaining balance of the senior secured term loan in the first quarter of 2011; 39 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
$4.4million ($2.7million after tax) of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Terra;  a $2.0million ($1.3million after tax) gain on the sale of a non-core transportation business; and  $1.2million (no tax impact) of Peru project development costs.
Net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $349.2million in 2010 included $219.8million ($136.1million after tax) of net interest expense, including $85.9million ($53.1million after tax) of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs recognized upon repayment of the senior secured bridge loan and partial repayment of the senior secured term loan, $150.4million ($148.8million after tax) of business combination related expenses and Peru project development costs, a $28.3million ($17.5million after tax) gain on the sale of 5.0million shares of Terra Industries Inc. common stock, $21.6million ($13.4million after tax) of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Terra, a $19.4million ($12.0million after tax) non-cash charge in cost of sales recognized upon the sale of Terra's product inventory due to revaluing it to fair value under purchase accounting, a loss of $17.0million ($10.5million after tax) on the early retirement of Terra's senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and a net $9.6million pre-tax unrealized mark-to-market gain ($5.9million after tax) on natural gas derivatives.
Our gross margin increased $1.7billion, or 146%, to $2.9billion in 2011 from $1.2billion in 2010. The $1.7billion increase is due to higher average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices and sales volumes, the acquisition of Terra and lower realized natural gas costs, partially offset by higher phosphate fertilizer raw material costs and unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives in the current year compared to unrealized gains in the prior year.
Our net sales increased $2.1billion, or 54%, to $6.1billion in 2011 from $4.0billion in 2010. The increase in net sales was due to higher nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer average selling prices and sales volumes, including the impact of the Terra acquisition. Total sales volume increased 1.6million tons, or 12%, in 2011 to 14.9million tons as compared to 2010, as higher UAN, AN and phosphate fertilizer sales volumes were partially offset by lower ammonia sales volume.
Cash flow from operations increased $884.5million to $2.1billion in 2011, due primarily to increased profitability partially offset by lower customer advances and an increase in cash invested in inventory and accounts receivable.
As of December31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.2billion, $70.9million of illiquid investments in auction rate securities, and a $257.2million current liability attributable to customer advances related to cash deposits received under forward sales contracts. As of December31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $797.7million, short-term investments of $3.1million, illiquid investments in auction rate securities of $102.8million, and customer advances of $431.5million.
We paid cash dividends of $68.7million and $46.2million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in cash dividends was due primarily to an increase in the dividends paid per share in the second half of 2011.
40 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Company History We were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives. During the 1960s, we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities. During the 1970s and again during the 1990s, we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly, spending approximately $1billion in each of these decades.
We operated as a traditional supply cooperative until 2002, when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective, rather than assured supply to our owners. A critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace.
In August 2005, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In connection with the IPO, we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our pre-IPO owners' equity interests in CFIndustries, Inc., now our wholly-owned subsidiary, were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock.
In April 2010, we acquired Terra for a purchase price of $4.6billion, which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock. As a result of the Terra acquisition, we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities, our 75.3% interest in TNCLP and certain joint venture interests.
Significant Items 2011 In 2011, average selling prices increased due primarily to higher demand for fertilizer for the following reasons: higher planted acres in the spring season due to strong demand for corn and other grains which supported favorable farm economics; global fertilizer supply constraints resulting from both export restrictions and production curtailments affecting certain foreign fertilizer producers; and an expected high level of planted acres and fertilizer usage in the 2012 growing season. Higher average selling prices and sales volumes due to increased demand led to robust operating results in 2011. Consolidated net sales in 2011 increased by $2.1billion, or 54%, to $6.1billion, with increases due primarily to higher average selling prices in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments and higher unit volume due primarily to the impact of the Terra acquisition. In 2011, average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices increased by 38% and 36%, respectively. Gross margin increased by $1.7billion, or 146%, to $2.9billion in 2011 from $1.2billion in 2010. The 2011 results include a $77.3million ($48.0million after tax) unrealized mark to market loss on natural gas derivatives. Results in 2011 also include $145.5million of net interest expense ($90.2million after tax), a $34.8million pre-tax ($21.6million after tax) non-cash impairment charge related to our Woodward, Oklahoma methanol plant and a $32.5million ($20.0million after tax) gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses.
2010 In April 2010, we completed the $4.6billion acquisition of Terra and it became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CFHoldings. This acquisition made us a global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer industry, diversified our asset base and increased our geographic reach and operational efficiency, as well as significantly increased our scale and capital market presence. The financial results of the Terra business are included in the consolidated results subsequent to the acquisition date. Consolidated net sales in 2010 were $4.0billion, up 52%, as compared to $2.6billion in 2009 due to the impact of the Terra acquisition, optimal weather conditions during both fertilizer application seasons, and a favorable fertilizer environment due to strong farm economics. While average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices 41 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
declined by 11% in 2010, average phosphate fertilizer prices increased by 28%. Gross margin increased by $340.1million, or 41%, in 2010 to $1,179.5million. The 2010 results include a $9.6million ($5.9million after tax) unrealized mark to market gain on natural gas derivatives. Results in 2010 also include $219.8million of net interest expense ($136.1million after tax), $150.4million ($148.8million after tax) of business combination expenses and Peru project costs, a $28.3million gain ($17.5million after tax) on the sale of Terra common stock acquired during 2009, and $21.6million ($13.4million after tax) of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Terra.
2009 Market conditions in 2009 were weak as lower demand for our products resulted from high industry-wide inventories entering the year, poor weather conditions and our customers' hesitancy to restock due to an uncertain pricing environment. Pricing levels and raw material costs both declined in 2009. By late 2009, conditions had improved with expectations of a strong spring 2010 planting season and a tightening of the international supply/demand balance. Consolidated net sales in 2009 decreased by $1.3billion, or 33%, to $2.6billion, with decreases due primarily to lower average selling prices in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments. This decrease was partially offset by potash sales and higher UAN and phosphate export sales that we made in response to reduced domestic demand. Gross margin decreased by $383.3million to $839.4million in 2009 as the impact of lower average selling prices was partially mitigated by lower raw material costs and $87.5million ($54.0million after tax) of unrealized mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives. Results in 2009 include $53.4million ($44.9million after tax) of business combination expenses, $35.9million (no tax impact) of Peru project costs and an $11.9million gain ($7.4million after tax) on the sale of Terra common stock acquired during 2009.
Key Industry Factors We operate in a highly competitive, global industry. Our agricultural products are globally-traded commodities and, as a result, we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality. Moreover, our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors, including those outlined below.
Global Supply& Demand Historically, global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth, changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates, among other things. We expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on long-term fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. Short-term fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions, weather patterns, the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption, federal regulations, including requirements mandating increased use of bio-fuels and farm sector income. Other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buying/selling patterns of key consuming/exporting countries such as China, India or Brazil often play a major role in shaping near-term market fundamentals. The economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity. Supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs, availability of raw materials, government policies and global trade.
Natural Gas Prices Natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, urea, UAN and AN. Because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Canada, the price of 42 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
natural gas in North America directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses. Expenditures on natural gas comprised approximately 45% of the total cost of sales for our nitrogen fertilizer in 2011 and a higher percentage of cash production costs (total production costs less depreciation and amortization).
Farmers' Economics The demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted.
Global Trade in Fertilizer In addition to the relationship between global supply and demand, profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supply/demand balance within that region. Regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions. Some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product, relative currency values, the availability of credit and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters. The development of natural gas reserves in North America over the last few years has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world, making North American nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive. Changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world.
Imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in North America. Producers of nitrogen based fertilizers located in the Middle East, the former Soviet Union, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, North Africa and China are major exporters to North America.
The domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the world's largest exporter of DAP/MAP. Consequently, phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for U.S. DAP/MAP are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market, including fertilizer and trade policies of foreign governments, changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations.
Political and Social Government Policies The political and social policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports and exports, the subsidization of natural gas, the subsidization of domestic producers and the subsidization of exports. Due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production, the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives.
Factors Affecting Our Results Net Sales.
Our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize. The volumes, mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors. Net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers. Sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales.
43 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Cost of Sales.
Our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, purchased product costs, and distribution costs. Manufacturing costs, the most significant element of cost of sales, consist primarily of raw materials, realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments, maintenance, direct labor, depreciation and other plant overhead expenses. Purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities. Distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers.
We offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis including under our Forward Pricing Program (FPP) at prices and on delivery dates we propose. As our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us, we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas, the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost, using natural gas derivative instruments. We report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur. See "Forward Sales" later in this discussion and analysis. As a result of fixing the selling prices of our products, often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment. Volatility in quarterly reported earnings may arise from the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments in the value of derivatives.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payroll-related costs for our executive, administrative, legal, financial and marketing functions, as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees.
Restructuring and Integration Costs.
Restructuring and integration costs consist of expenses associated with the integration of the operations of Terra and CFIndustries. A summary of our restructuring actions and associated charges is included in Note15 to our consolidated financial statements.
Equity in Earnings of Operating Affiliates.
We have investments accounted for under the equity method for which the results are included in our operating earnings. These consist of the following: (1)50% ownership interest in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited (PLNL), which operates an ammonia production facility in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, and (2)50% interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in Houston, Texas. We include our share of the net earnings from these investments as an element of earnings from operations because these investments provide additional production and storage capacity to our operations and are integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities in the nitrogen segment. Our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition.
Other OperatingNet.
Other operatingnet includes the costs associated with our closed Bartow phosphate facility and other costs that do not relate directly to our central operations. Costs included in "other costs" include amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business, litigation expenses, and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets. In 2010, net other operating expense also included business combination related expenses and Peru project development costs. The business combination related expenses were associated with our acquisition of Terra and costs associated with responding to Agrium's proposed acquisition of CFHoldings. See Note14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on activity related to our acquisition of Terra.
44 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Interest Expense.
Our interest expense includes the interest on our long-term debt and notes payable, amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements and annual fees on our senior secured revolving credit facility. It excludes capitalized interest relating to the construction of major projects.
Interest Income.
Our interest income represents amounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents, investments and advances to unconsolidated affiliates.
Other Non-OperatingNet.
Other non-operating net includes gains and losses recognized on the sale of securities as well as dividends earned.
Income Taxes.
Our income tax provision includes all currently payable and deferred United States and foreign income tax expense applicable to our ongoing operations.
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income, of an appropriate character, in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.
In connection with our IPO in August 2005, CFIndustries, Inc. (CFI) ceased to be a non-exempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes, and we entered into a net operating loss agreement (NOL Agreement) with CFI's pre-IPO owners relating to the future utilization of the pre-IPO net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally determined that the NOLs can be utilized to offset applicable post-IPO taxable income, we will pay the pre-IPO owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved.
CFL, a Canadian consolidated variable interest entity, operates as a cooperative for Canadian income tax purposes and distributes all of its earnings as patronage dividends to its customers, including CFI. For Canadian income tax purposes, CFL is permitted to deduct an amount equal to the patronage dividends it distributes to its customers, provided that certain requirements are met. As a result, CFL records no income tax provision.
Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Non-Operating AffiliatesNet of Taxes.
Equity in earnings (loss) of non-operating affiliatesnet of taxes represents our share of the net earnings of the entities in which we have an ownership interest and exert significant operational and financial influence. Income taxes related to these investments, if any, are reflected in this line. The amounts recorded as equity in earnings (loss) of non-operating affiliatesnet of taxes relate to our investments in GrowHow and Keytrade. Our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition. We account for these investments as non-operating equity method investments, and exclude the net earnings of these investments in earnings from operations since these operations do not provide additional production capacity to us, nor are these operations integrated within our supply chain.
Net Earnings Attributable to the Noncontrolling Interest.
Amounts reported as net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest represent the 34% interest in the net operating results of CFL and the 24.7% interest in the net operating results of TNCLP, a master limited partnership that owns the nitrogen manufacturing facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma.
We own 49% of the voting common stock of CFL and 66% of CFL's non-voting preferred stock. Viterra Inc. (Viterra) owns 34% of the voting common stock and non-voting preferred stock of CFL.
45 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
The remaining 17% of the voting common stock of CFL is owned by GROWMARK, Inc. (GROWMARK) and La Coop fdre. We operate CFL's Medicine Hat facility and purchase approximately 66% of the facility's ammonia and urea production, pursuant to a management agreement and a product purchase agreement. Both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either us or CFL upon a twelve-month notice. Viterra has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the remaining 34% of the facility's ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement. To the extent that Viterra does not purchase its 34% of the facility's production, we are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts. Since 1995, however, Viterra or its predecessor has purchased at least 34% of the facility's production each year. The product purchase agreement also provides that CFL will distribute its net earnings to us and Viterra annually based on the respective quantities of product purchased from CFL. See Note4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on CFL.
Through the acquisition of Terra in April 2010, we own an aggregate 75.3% of TNCLP and outside investors own the remaining 24.7%. The TNCLP Agreement of Limited Partnership allows the General Partner to receive Incentive Distribution Rights (IDRs) once a minimum threshold has been met. Partnership interests in TNCLP are traded on the NYSE and TNCLP is separately registered with the SEC.

Year Ended December31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2010 Consolidated Operating Results Our total gross margin increased $1.7billion, or 146%, to $2.9billion for the year ended December31, 2011 from $1.2billion in 2010 due to increases in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments. In the nitrogen segment, the gross margin increased by $1.6billion to $2.6billion for 2011 compared to $1.0billion in 2010 due primarily to higher average selling prices, the acquisition of Terra, the results of which were included for four quarters in 2011 and three quarters in 2010, and lower realized natural gas costs. These results were partially offset by unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives in the current year compared to unrealized gains in the prior year. In the phosphate segment, gross margin increased by $179.6million to $332.4million for 2011 compared to $152.8million for 2010, due primarily to higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs, namely sulfur and ammonia.
The net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $1.5billion for 2011 included a net $77.3million pre-tax unrealized mark-to-market loss ($48.0million after tax) on natural gas derivatives, a $34.8million pre-tax ($21.6million after tax) non-cash impairment charge related to our Woodward, Oklahoma methanol plant, a $32.5million ($20.0million after tax) gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses, $19.9million ($12.3million after tax) of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs recognized upon repayment of the remaining balance of the senior secured term loan in the first quarter of 2011, $4.4million ($2.7million after tax) of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Terra, a $2.0million ($1.3million after tax) gain on the sale of a non-core transportation business, and $1.2million (no tax impact) of Peru project development costs.
The 2010 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $349.2million included $219.8million ($136.1million after tax) of net interest expense including $85.9million ($53.1million after tax) of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount recognized upon repayment of the senior secured bridge loan and partial repayment of the senior secured term loan, $150.4million ($148.8million after tax) of business combination related expenses and Peru project development costs, a $28.3million ($17.5million after tax) gain on the sale of 5.0million shares of Terra Industries Inc. common stock, $21.6million ($13.4million after tax) of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Terra, a $19.4million ($12.0million after tax) non-cash charge in cost of sales recognized upon the sale of Terra's product inventory due to revaluing it to fair value under purchase accounting, a loss of $17.0million ($10.5million after tax) on the early retirement of Terra's 2019 Notes, and a net $9.6million pre-tax unrealized mark-to-market gain ($5.9million after tax) on natural gas derivatives.
Net Sales Our net sales increased 54% to $6.1billion in the year ended December31, 2011 from $4.0billion in 2010. This $2.1billion increase was due to higher nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer average selling prices and sales volumes, including the impact of the Terra acquisition. Average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices increased by 38% and 36%, respectively. Average selling prices increased due primarily to higher demand for fertilizer for the following reasons: higher planted acres in the spring season due to strong demand for corn and other grains which supported favorable farm economics; global fertilizer supply constraints resulting from both export restrictions and production curtailments at certain foreign fertilizer producers; and expected high planted acres and fertilizer usage in the 2012 growing season. Total sales volume increased 1.6million tons, or 12%, in 2011 to 14.9million tons as compared to 13.3million tons in 2010, as higher UAN and AN sales volumes due to the impact of the 48 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Terra acquisition and phosphate fertilizer sales volumes were partially offset by lower ammonia sales volume.
Cost of Sales Average cost of sales in our nitrogen segment of $188 per ton in 2011 approximated 2010 as lower realized natural gas costs in 2011 were offset by unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives. Phosphate segment cost of sales averaged $392 per ton in 2011 compared to $335 per ton in the prior year, an increase of 17%, due primarily to higher sulfur and ammonia costs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $23.9million to $130.0million in 2011 from $106.1million in 2010 due primarily to higher professional service fees, costs associated with the design and implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system and higher performance-based incentive compensation.
Restructuring and Integration Costs Restructuring and integration costs decreased $17.2million to $4.4million in 2011 from $21.6million in 2010, as integration activities associated with the acquisition of Terra have declined substantially and these costs ceased by the end of 2011.
Other OperatingNet Net other operating expenses decreased $145.8million to $20.9million in 2011 compared to $166.7million in 2010. The $20.9million of expense recorded in 2011 consists primarily of the following items: a $34.8million impairment charge related to our Woodward, Oklahoma methanol plant, a $32.5million gain that was recognized on the sale of four dry-product warehouses, $8.1million of costs associated with our closed Bartow phosphate facility, losses of $7.2million on the disposal of fixed assets and a $2.0million gain on the sale of a non-core transportation business.
The Woodward, Oklahoma methanol plant was part of a nitrogen complex that was acquired with the Terra acquisition. The Woodward complex could produce both nitrogen based fertilizers and methanol. Based on a strategic review that was completed in the third quarter of 2011, the Woodward complex will focus on fertilizer production. As a result, management approved the permanent shutdown, removed the methanol plant, and recognized the impairment charge.
The expense in 2010 is primarily business combination costs associated with our acquisition of Terra, including a $123.0million termination fee paid to Yara International ASA in the first quarter of 2010, and project development costs.
Equity in Earnings of Operating Affiliates Equity in earnings of operating affiliates in 2011 and 2010 consists of our 50% share of the operating results of PLNL and our 50% interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in Houston, Texas. The $39.6million increase in 2011 compared to 2010 is due to improved PLNL operating results due primarily to higher ammonia prices caused by a strong international market.
InterestNet Net interest expense was $145.5million in 2011 compared to $219.8million in 2010. The financing costs of the Terra acquisition, including the accelerated amortization of debt fees, impacted both 2010 49 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
and 2011. In the second quarter of 2010, we financed the Terra acquisition with a senior secured bridge loan, a senior secured term loan and senior notes. The senior secured bridge loan and a portion of the senior secured term loan were repaid over the last three quarters of 2010 and accelerated loan fee amortization of $85.9 was recognized in 2010. In the first quarter of 2011, the remaining balance of the senior secured term loan was repaid in full and accelerated loan fee amortization of $19.9million was recognized.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt Loss on extinguishment of debt in 2010 consisted of the $17.0million loss on the early retirement of Terra's 2019 Notes. This amount represents the difference between the amount paid to settle the debt of $744.5million and the fair value of the notes on April5, 2010 of $727.5million as the notes were recognized at fair value under purchase accounting.
Other Non-OperatingNet Net other non-operating income was $0.6million in 2011 compared to $28.8million in 2010. The income in 2010 includes a $28.3million gain on the sale of 5.0million shares of Terra's common stock.
Income Taxes Our income tax provision for the year ended December31, 2011 was $926.5million compared to $273.7million for 2010. The effective tax rate for 2011 based on the reported tax provision of $926.5million and reported pre-tax income of $2.6billion was 35.0%. This compares to 39.8% in the prior year. The effective tax rate for 2011 based on pre-tax income exclusive of the noncontrolling interest was 38.2%. This compares to 45.9% in the prior year. The decrease in the effective tax rate based on pre-tax income exclusive of noncontrolling interest resulted primarily from a decrease in non-deductible costs associated with our acquisition of Terra and Peru project development activities, partially offset by higher U.S. taxes related to foreign operations. The effective tax rate based on pretax income differs from our effective tax rate based on pre-tax income exclusive of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, as our consolidated income tax provision does not include tax provisions on the earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in TNCLP and CFL, which record no income tax provisions. See Note13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes.
Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Non-Operating AffiliatesNet of Taxes Equity in earnings (loss) of non-operating affiliatesnet of taxes for 2011 and 2010 consists of our share of the operating results of unconsolidated joint venture interests in GrowHow and Keytrade. The $15.2million increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was due primarily to higher GrowHow earnings resulting from a strong U.K. nitrogen fertilizer market.
Net Earnings Attributable to the Noncontrolling Interest Amounts reported as net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests include the interest of the 34% holder of CFL's common and preferred shares and the net earnings attributable to the 24.7% interest of the publicly held common units of TNCLP. During all four quarters of 2011 and the last three quarters of 2010, the TNCLP minimum quarterly distribution was exceeded, which entitled us to receive increased distributions on our general partner interests as provided for in the TNCLP Agreement of Limited Partnership. For additional information, see Note4 to our consolidated financial statements.

Diluted Net Earnings Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders Diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders increased to $21.98 per share in 2011 from $5.34 per share in 2010 due primarily to the increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders, partially offset by an increase in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding. In April 2010, we issued 9.5million shares of our common stock in connection with the Terra acquisition and 12.9million shares in the subsequent public offering. During the last half of 2011, we repurchased 6.5million shares.
Year Ended December31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2009 Consolidated Operating Results Our total gross margin increased $340.1million, or 41%, to $1,179.5million for the year ended December31, 2010 from $839.4million for 2009 due to increased gross margin in the nitrogen and phosphate segments. In the nitrogen segment, the gross margin increased by $242.5million to $1,026.7million for 2010 compared to $784.2million in 2009 due to the $358.3million contributed by the Terra acquisition. The positive impacts of Terra, lower realized natural gas costs, and higher nitrogen fertilizer sales volumes were partially offset by lower average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices, and lower unrealized mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2010 compared to the prior year. In the phosphate segment, gross margin increased by $97.6million to $152.8million for 2010 compared to $55.2million for 2009, due primarily to higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices in 2010 and losses on the sale of potash in 2009, partially offset by higher raw material and purchased product costs in 2010.
The net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $349.2million for 2010 included $219.8million ($136.1million after tax) of net interest expense including $85.9million ($53.1million after tax) of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount recognized upon repayment of the senior secured bridge loan and partial repayment of the senior secured term loan, $150.4million ($148.8million after tax) of business combination related expenses and Peru project development costs, a $28.3million ($17.5million after tax) gain on the sale of 5.0million shares of Terra Industries Inc. common stock, $21.6million ($13.4million after tax) of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Terra, a $19.4million ($12.0million after tax) non-cash charge in cost of sales recognized upon the sale of Terra's product inventory due to revaluing it to fair value under purchase accounting, a loss of $17.0million ($10.5million after tax) on the early retirement of Terra's 2019 Notes, and a net $9.6million pre-tax unrealized mark-to-market gain ($5.9million after tax) on natural gas derivatives.
The 2009 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $365.6million included $53.4million ($44.9million after tax) of costs associated with our acquisition of Terra and the cost of responding to Agrium's proposed acquisition of CFHoldings, $35.9million (no tax impact) of Peru project development costs, a net pre-tax unrealized mark-to-market gain of $87.5million ($54.0million after tax) on natural gas derivatives and an $11.9million ($7.4million after tax) gain on the sale of Terra common stock.
Net Sales Our net sales increased 52% to $4.0billion in 2010 from $2.6billion in 2009. This $1.4billion increase was due primarily to the inclusion of net sales of $1.4billion related to our acquisition of Terra. Higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices and higher nitrogen fertilizer sales volume were offset by lower average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices and lower phosphate segment sales volumes. Total sales volume increased 5.2million tons, or 65%, in 2010 to 13.3million tons as compared to 51 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
8.1million tons in 2009 due to the Terra acquisition. The Terra acquisition, increased demand resulting from strong spring and fall application seasons due to favorable weather conditions and expectations of higher planted acres in 2011, and tight international supplies favorably impacted net sales in 2010.
Cost of Sales Total cost of sales in our nitrogen segment averaged approximately $189 per ton in 2010 compared to $180 per ton in 2009. This 5% increase was due primarily to lower unrealized mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2010 compared to 2009 and higher depreciation and amortization associated with revaluing acquired assets, partially offset by lower realized natural gas costs. Phosphate segment cost of sales averaged $335 per ton in 2010 compared to $317 per ton in the prior year, an increase of 6%, due primarily to higher raw material and purchased product costs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $43.2million to $106.1million in 2010 from $62.9million in 2009 due primarily to the acquisition of Terra.
Restructuring and Integration Costs Restructuring and integration costs consist of $21.6million incurred during the last three quarters of 2010 to integrate the operations of Terra and CFIndustries. A summary of our restructuring actions and associated charges is included in Note15 to our consolidated financial statements.
Equity in Earnings of Operating Affiliates Equity in earnings of operating affiliates in 2010 consists of our 50% share of the operating results of PLNL and our 50% interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in Houston, Texas, both of which were acquired as part of the Terra acquisition.
Other OperatingNet Net other operating expenses increased $70.0million to $166.7million in 2010 compared to $96.7million in 2009. This increase was due primarily to $150.4million of costs associated with our acquisition of Terra, including a $123.0million termination fee paid to Yara International ASA, the cost of responding to Agrium's proposed acquisition of CFHoldings, and Peru project development costs.
InterestNet Net interest expense was $219.8million in 2010 compared to $3.0million of net interest income in 2009. The change was due primarily to interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior secured bridge facility, senior secured term facility and senior notes. Interest expense includes $85.9million of accelerated amortization of debt fees recognized upon repayment of the senior secured bridge loan and partial repayment of the senior secured term loan.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt Loss on extinguishment of debt consists of the $17.0million loss on the early retirement of Terra's 2019 Notes. This amount represents the difference between the amount paid to settle the debt of $744.5million and the fair value of the notes on April5, 2010 of $727.5million as the notes were recognized at fair value under purchase accounting.

Income Taxes Our income tax provision for the year ended December31, 2010 was $273.7million compared to $246.0million for 2009. The effective tax rate for 2010 based on the reported tax provision of $273.7million and reported pre-tax income of $687.7million was 39.8%. This compares to 35.4% in the prior year. The effective tax rate for 2010 based on pre-tax income exclusive of the noncontrolling interest was 45.9%. This compares to 40.2% in the prior year. The increase in the effective tax rate based on pre-tax income exclusive of noncontrolling interest resulted primarily from an increase in non-deductible costs associated with our acquisition of Terra and Peru project development activities. See Note13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes.
Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Non-Operating AffiliatesNet of Taxes Equity in earnings (loss) of non-operating affiliatesnet of taxes for 2010 consists of our share of the operating results of unconsolidated joint venture interests in Keytrade and GrowHow, which was acquired as part of the Terra acquisition.
Net Earnings Attributable to the Noncontrolling Interest Amounts reported as net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests include the interest of the 34% holder of CFL's common and preferred shares and the net earnings attributable to the 24.7% interest of the publicly held common units of TNCLP. During the last three quarters of 2010, the TNCLP minimum quarterly distribution was met which entitled us to receive increased distributions on our general partner interests as provided for in the TNCLP Agreement of Limited Partnership. For additional information, see Note4 to our consolidated financial statements.
Diluted Net Earnings Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders Diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders declined to $5.34 per share in 2010 from $7.42 per share in 2009 due primarily to the increase in diluted weighted average shares outstanding. In April 2010, we issued 9.5million shares of our common stock in conjunction with the Terra acquisition and 12.9million shares in the subsequent public offering.
Operating Results by Business Segment Our business is organized and managed internally based on two segments, the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment, which are differentiated primarily by their products, the markets they serve and the regulatory environments in which they operate.

Year Ended December31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2010 Net Sales.
Nitrogen segment net sales increased $1.8billion, or 57%, to $5.0billion in 2011 compared to $3.2billion in 2010 due primarily to higher average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices and UAN and AN sales volume, partially offset by lower ammonia sales volume. Average nitrogen fertilizer 54 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
selling prices increased to $385 per ton in 2011 from $278 per ton in 2010, with increases across all products. Strong demand for the spring application season due to an increase in planted acres, depleted supplies available at both the producer and customer level due to strong demand, global supply constraints and expectations that 2012 planted acres will remain at historically high levels resulted in higher average selling prices. Nitrogen fertilizer sales volume in 2011 increased 1.5million tons from 2010 due primarily to higher UAN and AN sales volumes, partially offset by lower ammonia sales volume. UAN sales volume increased significantly during 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to the acquisition of Terra and the increased supply available from the Woodward, Oklahoma UAN plant expansion. The increased UAN production capacity allowed us to meet increased demand for UAN resulting from favorable spring application conditions and customers replenishing depleted downstream inventories after the strong spring application season. The increase in AN sales in 2011 from the prior year is due to the inclusion of a full year of AN sales in 2011 as the production capacity for this product was obtained in the Terra acquisition. The 2011 decrease in ammonia sales is due primarily to the additional ammonia required to support the production from the UAN plant expansion at Woodward.
Cost of Sales.
Total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged approximately $188 per ton in 2011 compared to $189 per ton in 2010. Lower realized natural gas costs in 2011 were offset by unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives. We recognized a $77.3million unrealized mark-to-market loss in 2011 compared to a net $9.6million unrealized mark-to-market gain in 2010.
Year Ended December31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2009 Net Sales.
Nitrogen segment net sales increased $1.3billion, or 73%, to $3.2billion in 2010 compared to $1.8billion in 2009 due primarily to the acquisition of Terra and increased ammonia sales volume, which was partially offset by lower average selling prices across nitrogen products. Nitrogen fertilizer sales volume in 2010 increased 5.6million tons from 2009 due primarily to the acquisition of Terra. Ammonia sales volume increased significantly during 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to the Terra acquisition, plus strong spring and fall application seasons due to favorable weather conditions and increased fourth quarter demand due to expectations of strong planted acres in 2011. Urea and UAN sales volume increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 due primarily to the acquisition of Terra. During 2009, we benefited from substantial forward sales volume that had been contracted at earlier dates and higher prices.
Cost of Sales.
Total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged approximately $189 per ton in 2010 compared to $180 per ton in 2009. The 5% increase was due primarily to lower unrealized mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives in 2010 compared to the prior year period, higher depreciation and amortization expense due to the Terra acquisition and a greater percentage of sales volume in the form of ammonia, partially offset by lower realized natural gas costs. We recognized a $9.6million unrealized mark-to-market gain in 2010 compared to a net $87.5million unrealized mark-to-market gain in 2009.

Phosphate segment net sales increased $308.3million to $1.1billion in 2011 from $777.5million in 2010 due to higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices and sales volume. Average phosphate fertilizer selling prices for 2011 increased by 36% compared to the prior year, resulting from supply constraints in the international market and strong domestic demand for the spring application season. Our total volume of phosphate fertilizer sales increased 3% to 1.9million tons in 2011 due primarily to increased planted corn acres, favorable farm-level economics during the spring application season and increased export sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 in response to weakness in the domestic market.
56 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Cost of Sales.
Phosphate fertilizers cost of sales averaged $392 per ton in 2011 compared to $335 per ton in the prior year. The 17% increase was due primarily to higher raw material costs for sulfur and ammonia.
Year Ended December31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2009 Net Sales.
Phosphate segment net sales increased $8.4million to $777.5million in 2010 from $769.1million in 2009 due to higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices, partially offset by lower phosphate segment sales volume. Average phosphate fertilizer selling prices for 2010 increased by 28% compared to the prior year, resulting from increased demand and tight international supplies. Our total volume of phosphate fertilizer sales of 1.9million tons in 2010 was 10% lower than in 2009 due primarily to lower export sales and lower phosphate inventories available for sale. The phosphate segment net sales included 164,000tons of potash in 2009. There were no potash sales in 2010.
Cost of Sales.
Phosphate fertilizers cost of sales averaged $335 per ton in 2010 compared to $283 per ton in the prior year. The 18% increase was due primarily to higher raw material costs for sulfur, ammonia and phosphate rock produced at our mine.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Generally, our primary source of cash is cash from operations, which includes customer advances. Our primary uses of cash are generally for operating costs, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, investments and dividends. Our working capital requirements are affected by several factors, including demand for our products, selling prices for our products, raw material costs, freight costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business.
Under our short-term investment policy, we may invest our excess cash balances in several types of securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations, and money market funds. Securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the U.S. and Canadian governments; those issued by state, local or other governmental entities; and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities.
Cash Balances As of December31, 2011 and 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.2billion and $797.7million, respectively. We also had short-term investments of $3.1million as of December31, 2010. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, we had a current liability attributable to customer advances of $257.2million and $431.5million, respectively, associated with forward sales commitments.
Share Repurchase Program On August4, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase our common stock for a total expenditure of up to $1.5billion plus program expenses. Repurchases under this program were authorized to be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise through December31, 2013. We repurchased approximately 6.5million shares under this program at an aggregate cost of $1.0billion.
Investments in Auction Rate Securities As of December31, 2011, our investments in auction rate securities were reported at their fair value of $70.9million, after reflecting a $4.7million unrealized holding loss against a par value of 57 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
$75.6million. At December31, 2010, our investments in auction rate securities totaled $102.8million, after reflecting a $7.6million unrealized holding loss against a par value of $110.4million.
Because the traditional auction process for auction rate securities generally has failed since early 2008, we do not consider our auction rate securities to be liquid investments. We are not able to access these funds until such time as auctions for the securities succeed once again, buyers are found outside the auction process, or the securities are redeemed by the issuers. During 2011, $34.8million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par value. In accordance with our policies, we review the underlying securities and assess the creditworthiness of these securities as part of our investment process.
We determined the fair value of these investments at December31, 2011 using a mark-to-model approach that relies on discounted cash flows, market data and inputs derived from similar instruments. The unrealized holding loss has been reported in other comprehensive income as the impairment is deemed to be temporary based on the requirements set forth in ASC Topic 320 InvestmentsDebt and Equity Securities . See Note5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our investments in auction rate securities.
The model we use to value our auction rate securities uses discounted cash flow calculations as one of the significant inputs to the ultimate determination of fair value. The base interest rates assumed for the required rates of return are key components of the calculation of discounted cash flows. If the required rate of return we used in the calculation model was 100 basis points higher, the resulting holding loss would have been approximately $4.2million greater. We may need to recognize either additional holding gains or losses in other comprehensive income or holding losses in net earnings should changes occur in either the conditions in the credit markets, the credit worthiness of the issuers, or in the variables considered in our valuation model.
We believe ultimately we will recover the historical cost for these instruments as we presently intend to hold these securities until market liquidity returns either through resumption of auctions or otherwise. We do not believe the ongoing market liquidity issues regarding these securities present any operating liquidity issues for us. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, operating cash flow, and credit available under our credit facility are adequate to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
Debt As of December31, 2011, we had $1.6billion of outstanding senior notes and $13.0million of Terra 7% senior notes due 2017 (2017 Notes). As of December31, 2010, we had $346.0million of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured term loan facility (term loan facility), $1.6billion of outstanding senior notes, and $13.0million of 2017 Notes. During the first quarter of 2011, we repaid the remaining $346.0million outstanding under the term loan facility using cash generated from operations. Our senior notes were issued in two series of $800million each. The first series carries an interest rate of 6.875% and is due in the aggregate in 2018. The second series carries an interest rate of 7.125% and is due in the aggregate in 2020.
Notes payable, representing amounts owed by CFL to its noncontrolling interest holder with respect to advances, were $4.8million as of December31, 2011 compared to $4.9million as of December31, 2010. During 2011, the notes payable outstanding at December31, 2010 were cancelled and reissued with a maturity date of December31, 2013.
We have a senior secured revolving credit facility, which provides for $500million of borrowings outstanding at any time for working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes. As of December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, $491.2million and $482.9million, respectively, was 58 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility, reflecting $8.8million and $17.1million, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings thereunder.
The credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility includes representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including requirements that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as well as other customary covenants. Our senior notes indentures also include certain covenants and events of default. As of December31, 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement and the senior notes indentures.
See Note25 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our outstanding indebtedness.
Acquisition of Terra Industries Inc.
In April of 2010, we completed the acquisition of Terra through the merger of Composite Merger Corporation, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary (Composite), with and into Terra pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March12, 2010 among CFHoldings, Composite and Terra (the Merger Agreement). As a result of the merger, Terra became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the CFHoldings. The acquisition of Terra has made us a global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer industry, diversified our asset base and increased our geographic reach and operational efficiency, and significantly increased our scale and capital market presence.
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Terra common stock was converted into the right to receive $37.15 in cash and 0.0953 of a share of CFHoldings common stock pursuant to an exchange offer and second-step merger (the Merger). CFHoldings issued an aggregate of 9.5million shares of its common stock with a fair value of $882.0million and paid an aggregate of $3.2billion in cash, net of $0.5billion cash acquired, for 100% of Terra's common stock.
We funded the cash requirements of the acquisition with cash on hand, $1.75billion of borrowings under a senior secured bridge facility and approximately $1.9billion of borrowings under a senior secured term loan facility that provided for up to $2.0billion of borrowings. On April21, 2010, CFHoldings completed a public offering of approximately 12.9million shares of common stock at $89.00 per share. The proceeds of $1.1billion, net of underwriting discounts and customary fees, were used to repay a portion of the senior secured bridge facility. On April23, 2010, CFIndustries completed a public offering of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1.6billion. Approximately $645.2million of the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay in full the remaining outstanding borrowings under the senior secured bridge facility. We used the remaining proceeds from the offering to repay approximately $864.2million of the senior secured term loan facility. In May 2010, we redeemed Terra's 7.75% senior notes due 2019 for $744.5million and recognized a $17.0million loss on the early extinguishment of that debt. See Note25Financing Agreements, for further information regarding these financing arrangements.
Capital Spending Capital expenditures of $247.2million in 2011 were made to sustain our asset base, to increase our capacity, to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental, health and safety requirements. The $10.9million decrease in capital expenditures in 2011 as compared to 2010 is due primarily to the absence of spending in 2011 on the Woodward, Oklahoma UAN plant expansion, offset partially by an increase in routine capital projects. We expect to spend approximately $400.0million on capital expenditures in 2012. The anticipated increase is due primarily to an increase in scheduled 59 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
turnarounds in 2012, higher spending on environmental, health and safety projects and the announced project to increase production and efficiency at our Donaldsonville nitrogen complex.
Planned capital expenditures for 2012 are subject to change due to unanticipated increases in the cost, scope and completion time. For example, we may experience increases in labor and equipment costs necessary to comply with government regulations or to complete projects that sustain or improve the profitability of our operations.
Forward Sales We offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis including under our Forward Pricing Program (FPP) at prices and on delivery dates we propose. As our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us, we generally lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these future sales mainly by using natural gas derivative instruments and fixed price purchase contracts to hedge against price changes for natural gas that will be purchased in the future. Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based fertilizers. As a result of using derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas, volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments in the value of the derivatives and our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment. Unlike nitrogen fertilizer products sold under forward sales contracts for which we effectively fix the cost of natural gas, we typically are unable to fix the cost of phosphate raw materials, principally sulfur and ammonia, which are among the largest components of our phosphate manufacturing costs. As a result, we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis.
Customer advances, which typically represent a portion of the contract's sales value, are received shortly after the contract is executed, with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped, thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales. Any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped, which may be several months after the order is placed. As is the case for all of our sale transactions, revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers. As of December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, we had approximately $257.2million and $431.5million, respectively, in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets.
While customer advances were a significant source of liquidity in both 2011 and 2010, the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers' outlook of future market fundamentals. The level of forward orders as of December31, 2011 may reflect our customers' views of the current fertilizer pricing environment and expectations regarding future pricing and availability of supply.
Under the FPP, a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors. These delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us. Such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of an FPP contract due to a customer's inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales. We may also be subject to storage charges under these arrangements should we be unable to deliver product at the specified time. If the level of sales under the FPP were to decrease in the future, our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase. Also, borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility could become necessary. Due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations, we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity.
60 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Natural Gas Derivatives We use natural gas derivative instruments primarily to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on forward sales contracts. Our natural gas acquisition policy also allows us to establish derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our FPP.
Natural gas derivatives involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts. The counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions. Cash collateral is deposited with or received from counterparties when predetermined unrealized loss or gain thresholds are exceeded. For derivatives that are in net asset positions, we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties. We control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties, individual credit limits, monitoring procedures, cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements.
The master netting arrangements to our derivative instruments also contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require us to maintain minimum net worth levels and certain financial ratios. If we fail to meet these minimum requirements, the counterparties to derivative instruments for which we are in net liability positions could require daily cash settlement of unrealized losses or some other form of credit support.
As of December31, 2011, the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position was $74.7million. We had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts as of December31, 2011.
Financial Assurance Requirements In addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate segment, we are subject to financial assurance requirements. Pursuant to the Florida regulations governing financial assurance related to the closure and maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems, we established an escrow account to meet such future obligations. Contributions to this escrow account, by rule, are earmarked to cover the closure, long-term maintenance, and monitoring costs for our phosphogypsum stacks, as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack systems upon closure.
In 2010, we entered into a consent decree (the Plant City Consent Decree) with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) with respect to our Plant City, Florida phosphate fertilizer complex and its compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). In addition to requirements to modify certain operating practices and undertake certain capital improvement projects, the Plant City Consent Decree requires us to provide financial assurance with respect to our ability to fund the closure, long-term maintenance, and monitoring costs for the Plant City phosphogypsum stack, as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure. In 2010, we established a trust for the benefit of the EPA and the FDEP and we deposited approximately $54.8million into the trust. We also transferred approximately $26.9million from our previously established escrow account described above. In 2011, we made an additional contribution of $50.4million, and we expect to deposit approximately the same amount in 2012, at which point the trust will be fully funded. Additional funding may be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed investment earnings in the trust. At December31, 2011 the balance in the trust was $132.2million.
Prior to the Plant City Consent Decree, our financial assurance requirements for the closure, long-term maintenance, and monitoring costs for the Plant City phosphogypsum stack system were determined solely by Florida regulations which would have required funding of the escrow account over a period of years. The Plant City Consent Decree described above effectively requires us to fund the greater of the requirements under the Plant City Consent Decree or Florida law, which may differ over 61 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
time. We are still required under Florida law to maintain the existing Florida escrow account for the closure, long-term maintenance, monitoring, and water management costs for the phosphogypsum stack system at our closed Bartow, Florida phosphate fertilizer complex. We made annual contributions of $3.7million and $7.5million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, to this escrow account. No contribution was necessary in 2011. At December31, 2011, the balance in this escrow account was $13.2million.
The amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in Note12 to our consolidated financial statements. These expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the trust and escrow accounts, which are based on the guidelines set forth in the Plant City Consent Decree and Florida regulations. Ultimately, the funds in these accounts will be used to fund the closure and maintenance of the phosphogypsum stack systems.
Florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation, wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities. We will also be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation and for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures, if and when we are able to expand our Hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted. The demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in Florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a trust fund agreement or escrow account. Based on these current regulations, we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in Florida utilizing any of these methods.
Repatriation of Foreign Earnings and Income Taxes We have operations in Canada and interests in corporate joint ventures in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. The estimated additional U.S. and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the U.S. are recognized as the amounts are earned, unless the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested based upon our current plans. However, the payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurs at the time of the repatriation. As a result, the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings, as applicable, and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings can occur in different periods. As of December31, 2011, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $22.0million, which reflects the additional U.S. and foreign income taxes that would be due upon the repatriation of approximately $500.0million of earnings by our non-U.S. subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures, which is considered not to be permanently reinvested at that date. The funding of these tax payments will be made with the cash repatriated from the foreign operations.
Other Liquidity Requirements We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning surface and underground waters. Such regulations evolve through various stages of proposal or development and the ultimate outcome of such rulemaking activities often cannot be predicted prior to enactment. At the present time, proposed regulations in the State of Florida are being considered to limit nutrient content in water discharges, including certain specific regulations pertaining to water bodies near our Florida operations. We are monitoring the evolution of these proposed regulations. Potential costs associated with compliance cannot be determined currently and we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
We contributed approximately $23.8million to our pension plans in the year ended December31, 2011. We expect to contribute approximately $19.8million to our pension plans in 2012.

Cash Flows Operating Activities Year Ended December31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2010 Net cash generated from operating activities in 2011 was $2.1billion as compared to $1.2billion in 2010. The $884.5million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to improved net earnings in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments, partially offset by lower customer advances and an increase in cash invested in inventory and accounts receivable in 2011 compared to 2010.
Year Ended December31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2009 Net cash generated from operating activities in 2010 was $1,194.4million as compared to $681.8million in 2009. The $512.6million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the impact of the Terra acquisition, improved financial performance in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments and favorable working capital changes in the business in 2010 versus 2009. Although the net earnings declined marginally between 2009 and 2010, that decline was more than explained by higher depreciation and amortization and an unfavorable change in the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on our natural gas derivatives, neither of which had any cash impact. During 2010, depreciation, depletion and amortization increased by $293.8million due primarily to the acquisition and step-up in value of the acquired Terra assets, and unrealized mark-to-market gains in 2009 were not repeated in 2010 which reduced pretax earnings by $78.1million as compared to 2009. The year-over-year favorable impact on cash flow from operations due to working capital changes was primarily attributable to an increase in customer deposits in 2010 versus a decline in 2009.
Investing Activities Years Ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 Net cash used in investing activities was $173.8million in 2011 compared to $3.1billion used in 2010. The cash used in investing activities in 2011 was primarily for capital expenditures, partially offset by $54.7million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and $37.9million in sales and maturities of short term and auction rate securities. The proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment primarily relate to the sale of four dry product warehouses and a non-core transportation business. The $3.1billion in cash used in investing activities in 2010 was due primarily to the net cash consideration of $3.2billion for the acquisition of Terra, partially offset by $209.6million of cash provided by net sales of short-term investments and redemptions of auction rate securities, and proceeds of $167.1million from the sale of Terra Industries Inc. common stock prior to the acquisition of Terra, compared to $179.2million of net purchases of Terra Industries Inc. common stock in 2009. Additions to property, plant and equipment accounted for $247.2million, $258.1million, and $235.7million of cash used in investing activities in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. We made contributions of $50.4million, $58.5million, and $7.5million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to our asset retirement obligation trust and escrow accounts. The balance in these accounts is reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets.
Financing Activities Years Ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 Net cash used in financing activities was $1.5billion in 2011 compared to net cash generated from financing activities of $2.0billion in 2010. In 2011, $1.0billion was used to repurchase our common stock and $346.0million was used for the repayment of long-term debt. The $2.1billion increase in 63 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
cash provided by financing activities in 2010 was due primarily to $5.2billion of proceeds from the issuance of debt and $1.2billion from the issuance of common stock in a public offering associated with our acquisition of Terra, partially offset by $4.0billion of prepayments on our debt and $0.2billion of financing fees. See the "Acquisition of Terra Industries Inc." section of this discussion and analysis for additional information. We paid distributions to our noncontrolling interests of $145.7million, $117.0million and $112.3million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Dividends paid on common stock were $68.7million, $26.2million, and $19.4million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2010, we also paid $20.0million of dividends declared by Terra prior to the acquisition date.

(2) Represents notes payable to the CFL noncontrolling interest holder. While the entire principal amount is due December31, 2013, CFL may prepay all or a portion of the principal at its sole option.
(3) Includes anticipated expenditures under certain contracts to transport raw materials and finished product between our facilities. The majority of these arrangements allow for reductions in usage based on our actual operating rates. Amounts set forth above are based on projected normal operating rates and contracted or current spot prices, where applicable, as of December31, 2011 and actual operating rates and prices may differ.
(4) Includes minimum commitments to purchase natural gas valued based on prevailing market-based forward prices at December31, 2011.
64 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
(5) Includes a commitment to purchase ammonia from PLNL at market-based prices under an agreement that expires in 2018. The annual commitment based on market prices at December31, 2011 is $159.0million with a total remaining commitment of $1.1billion. Purchase obligations do not include any amounts related to our financial hedges (i.e.,swaps) associated with natural gas purchases.
(6) Represents the contributions we expect to make to our pension plans during 2012. Our pension funding policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum legal funding requirements plus discretionary amounts that we may deem to be appropriate.
(7) Excludes $75.3million of unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty in the timing of payments, if any, on these items. See Note13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these unrecognized tax benefits.
Other Long-Term Obligations As of December31, 2011, our other liabilities included balances related to asset retirement obligations (AROs) and environmental remediation liabilities. The estimated timing and amount of cash outflows associated with these liabilities are as follows: Payments Due by Period 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After 2016 Total (in millions) Other Long-Term Obligations Asset retirement obligations (1)(2) $ 13.4 $ 10.3 $ 9.3 $ 8.0 $ 10.1 $ 636.4 $ 687.5 Environmental remediation liabilities 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 4.2 6.7 Total $ 13.9 $ 10.8 $ 9.8 $ 8.5 $ 10.6 $ 640.6 $ 694.2 (1) Represents the undiscounted, inflation-adjusted estimated cash outflows required to settle the recorded AROs. The corresponding present value of these future expenditures is $131.6million as of December31, 2011. Excludes any amounts we may be required to deposit into our escrow or trust accounts to meet our financial assurance funding requirements. See the discussion of our financial assurance requirements earlier in this section.
We also have unrecorded AROs at our nitrogen manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations. These AROs include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals, waste materials, structures, equipment, vessels, piping and storage tanks. Also included is reclamation of land and closure of effluent ponds. The most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these AROs expressed in 2011 dollars is approximately $47.0million. We do not believe that there is a reasonable basis for currently estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities. Therefore, the table above does not contain any payments for these AROs. See Note12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our AROs. As described in "Financial Assurance Requirements," we intend to set aside cash on an annual basis in escrow and trust accounts established to cover costs associated with closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems if necessary. These accounts will be the source of a significant portion of the cash required to settle the AROs pertaining to the phosphogypsum stack systems.
(2) Cash flows occurring after 2016 are detailed in the following table.
65 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
The following table details the undiscounted, inflation-adjusted estimated payments after 2016 required to settle the recorded AROs, as discussed above.
Payments Due by Period 2017 - 19 2020 - 29 2030 - 39 2040 - 49 2050 - 59 After 2059 Total (in millions) Asset retirement obligations $ 17.9 $ 59.1 $ 224.6 $ 71.7 $ 57.8 $ 205.3 $ 636.4 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements, the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of fertilizer, and terminal leases. The rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to ten years and the barge charter commitments currently have terms ranging from one to four years. We also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements at several of our distribution locations, some of which contain minimum throughput requirements. The storage agreements contain minimum terms ranging from one to three years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party.
Our operating lease agreements do not contain significant contingent rents, leasehold incentives, rent holidays, scheduled rent increases, concessions or unusual provisions. See Note26 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning leases.
We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. GAAP requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts, and the most recent information available to us. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate. The following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates.
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer, which can be at the plant gate, a distribution facility, a supplier location or a customer destination. In some cases, application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue, discounts and allowances, rebates, or creditworthiness of some of our customers. We base our estimates on historical experience, and the most recent information available to us, which can change as market conditions change. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations.
66 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation is computed using either the straight-line method or the units-of-production (UOP) method over the lives of the assets. The lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us. Estimated lives are based on historical experience, manufacturers' or engineering estimates, valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans. We review the depreciable lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment on a periodic basis, and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews.
Scheduled inspections, replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities are referred to as plant turnarounds. We account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method, as opposed to the direct expense or built-in overhaul methods. Under the deferral method, expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property, plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straight-line basis over the period benefited, which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5years. Should the estimated period between turnarounds change, we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher production costs. If we used the direct expense method, turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred. Scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling, repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping, valves, motors, turbines, pumps, compressors, heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs. Scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers, pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications. Capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented. Internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized. Turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the line entitled, "Additions to property, plant and equipment." Inventory Valuation We review our inventory balances at least quarterly, and more frequently if required by market conditions, to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value. This review process incorporates current industry and customer-specific trends, current operating plans, historical price activity, and selling prices expected to be realized. If the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value, we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly. Upon inventory liquidation, if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our most recent estimate of net realizable value, additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation.
Fixed Cost Write-Off Fixed costs are considered a part of normal product manufacturing costs and included in inventory value, provided that production from a specific plant is greater than 60% of that plant's total capacity. If production volumes fall below 60% of capacity during the month, the related overhead and other fixed costs are expensed in the period as incurred.
67 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) and Environmental Remediation Liabilities AROs are legal obligations associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the Bartow and Plant City, Florida phosphate fertilizer complexes, land reclamation activities at our Hardee, Florida phosphate rock mine and the cessation of operations at all of our facilities. If the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated, AROs are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service. We are required to recognize an ARO for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed, even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain. The obligations at active facilities related to closure, reclamation and cessation of operations are capitalized at their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded. The liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense. Accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time. The asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over the estimated useful life. In the case of reclamation, the asset is depreciated over the period the mining occurs, which in some cases, may be after initial recognition of the liability. The aggregate carrying value of all of our AROs was $131.6million as of December31, 2011 and $119.8million as of December31, 2010. The increase in the aggregate carrying value of these AROs is due to normal accretion expense and recognizing changes in estimates, offset by cash expenditures on AROs.
Environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts, existing technology, site-specific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations. In reporting environmental liabilities, no offset is made for potential recoveries. All liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur. In accordance with GAAP, environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits. Changes in laws, regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements. The amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled $6.7million as of December31, 2011 and $9.1million as of December31, 2010.
The actual amounts to be spent on AROs and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities, refinements in scope, technological developments and cost inflation, as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations. The estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes. We are also required to select discount rates to calculate the present value of AROs. Changes in these estimates or the selection of a different discount rate could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
We have unrecorded AROs at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations. These AROs include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals, waste materials, structures, equipment, vessels, piping and storage tanks. Also included is reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds. The most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these AROs expressed in 2011 dollars is $47.0million. We have not recorded a liability for these conditional AROs at December31, 2011 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities, which is necessary in order to estimate fair value. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance, asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment, which if conducted as in the past, can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities indefinitely. We also considered the possibility of changes in technology, risk of obsolescence, and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion.
68 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries We review the carrying values of our property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP in order to assess recoverability. Factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume, selling prices, raw material costs, operating expenses, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. Significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors, which include inherent uncertainties. The factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process. The recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill, long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed. Certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business. Adverse changes in demand for our products and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review.
The recoverability and impairment tests of long-lived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For goodwill, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. We review the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries annually to determine if there is a loss in value of the investment. We determine the fair value of the investment using an income approach valuation method. If the sum of the expected future discounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized immediately.
Goodwill is evaluated in the fourth quarter for impairment at the reporting unit level, in our case the nitrogen and phosphate segments. There is a two step impairment test. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. The second step of the goodwill impairment test, if needed, compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. We use an income based valuation method, determining the present value of future cash flows, to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. No goodwill impairment was identified in our 2011 or 2010 reviews. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, we had $2.1billion of goodwill, resulting mainly from the Terra acquisition.
Fair Value Measurements We have classified our investments in auction rate securities as those measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level3 securities) under the provisions of the current rules for assessing fair value. See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this discussion and analysis for detailed information concerning the critical accounting estimates involved in valuing and classifying these investments. No other assets or liabilities are classified as Level3 items on our consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2011. See Note5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning fair value measurements.
Income Taxes We recognize expenses, assets and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions. U.S. income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The judgments made at any point in 69 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, tax laws and regulations. We adjust income tax expense in the period when these changes occur.
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.
A deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which is considered to not be permanently reinvested. No deferred income taxes have been recorded for the remainder of our investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which we believe to be indefinitely reinvested.
As a large commercial enterprise with international operations, our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors. The most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation, changes in the geographic mix of earnings, the tax characteristics of our income, the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses, and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable. It is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense, net income and liquidity in future periods.
In connection with our initial public offering (IPO) in August 2005, CFIndustries, Inc. (CFI) ceased to be non-exempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes, and we entered into a net operating loss agreement (NOL Agreement) with CFI's pre-IPO owners relating to the future utilization of the pre-IPO net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally determined that the NOLs can be utilized to offset applicable post-IPO taxable income, we will pay the pre-IPO owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved. See Note13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the utilization of NOLs.
Pension Assets and Liabilities Pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, plan design, actuarial estimates and discount rates. Actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Our projected benefit obligation (PBO) related to our qualified pension plans was $763.3million at December31, 2011, which was $109.9million higher than pension plan assets. The December31, 2011 PBO was computed based on a weighted average discount rate of 4.6%, which was based on yields for high-quality (Aa rated or better) fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of December31. Declines in comparable bond yields would increase our PBO. If the discount rate used to compute the PBO was lower or higher by 50 basis points, our PBO would have been $52.5million higher or $47.2million lower, respectively, than the amount previously discussed. The weighted average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2011 was 5.4%. If the discount rate used to compute 2011 pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points, the expense would have been approximately $2.6million higher or $2.0million lower, 70 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
respectively, than the amount calculated. Our net benefit obligation, after deduction of plan assets, could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate. The 6.1% weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and non-equity investments, both separately and in combination over historical holding periods. If the expected long-term rate of return on assets was higher or lower by 50 basis points, pension expense for 2011 would have been $2.8million lower or higher, respectively. See Note7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our pension plans.
Retiree Medical Benefits Retiree medical benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions, including discount rates used to compute the present value of the future obligations and expected increases in health care costs. Changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs affect the recorded amount of retiree medical benefits expense.
Stock-Based Compensation Costs associated with stock-based compensation are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations at the grant date fair value of all stock-based awards over the service period. The fair value of nonqualified stock options granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model include expected volatility and expected term. The weighted-average expected volatility used to value the stock options granted in 2011 was 53%. If the expected volatility was 2% higher or lower, the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 3% higher or lower, respectively. The expected term of the stock options granted in 2011 was five years. If the expected term was six months longer or shorter, the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 4% higher or lower, respectively.
We accrue the cost of stock-based awards on the straight-line method over the applicable vesting period. As a result, total compensation cost recognized for 2011 on a pre-tax basis was $9.9million. As of December31, 2011, on a pre-tax basis there was approximately $10.8million and $5.9million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonqualified options and restricted stock which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 and 2.0years, respectively. See Note30 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of stock-based compensation.
Consolidation We consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest as well as variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Our judgment in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes: assessing our level of involvement in setting up the entity; determining whether the activities of the entity are substantially conducted on our behalf; determining whether we provide more than half the subordinated financial support to the entity; and determining whether we direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and absorb the majority of the entity's expected losses or returns.
We use the equity method to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. Our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies plus the amortization expense of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of purchase accounting. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy decisions and material intercompany transactions. We regularly review our variable interest entities for potential changes in consolidation status.

Discussion of Seasonality Impacts on Operations Our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature. The strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.
ITEM7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
We are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices, the valuation of our investments, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Commodity Prices Our net sales, cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to fertilizer sales are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged. A $1.00 per MMBtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia, urea and UAN (32%) by approximately $33, $22 and $13, respectively.
We use natural gas in the manufacture of our nitrogen products. Natural gas prices are volatile. We manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments covering periods not exceeding three years.
The derivative instruments that we use currently are natural gas swap contracts. These contracts settle using NYMEX futures price indexes, which represent fair value at any given time. The contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods.
We account for derivatives under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging . Under this section, derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and changes in their fair value are recognized immediately in earnings, unless the normal purchase and sale exemption applies. We use natural gas derivatives primarily as an economic hedge of gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting under ASC 815. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur. Cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities.
As of December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, we had open derivative contracts for 156.3million MMBtus and 51.8million MMBtus, respectively, of natural gas. For the year ended December31, 2011, we used derivatives to cover approximately 66% of our natural gas consumption. An overall $1.00 per MMBtu change in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change the pre-tax unrealized mark-to-market gain/loss on these derivative positions by $156.3million.

We purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of DAP and MAP. There can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered through increases in selling prices. We enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and sulfur at market prices. A $10 per ton change in the related cost of a ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change DAP production cost by $2.10 per ton and $3.80 per ton, respectively. We also may, from time to time, purchase ammonia, urea, UAN, DAP and MAP to augment or replace production at our facilities.
Investments in Auction Rate Securities As of December31, 2011, we had $70.9million of investments in auction rate securities consisting of available-for-sale tax exempt auction rate securities that were all supported by student loans that were originated primarily under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Due to the illiquidity in the credit markets, auctions for these securities have generally failed. As a result, we do not consider these investments to be liquid investments and we will not be able to access these funds until such time as auctions for these securities are successful, buyers are found outside of the auction process, or the securities are redeemed by the issuer. Further details regarding these securities are included in Note5 to the consolidated financial statements and in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources, both in this Form10-K.
The valuation of these securities utilizes a mark-to-model approach that relies on discounted cash flows, market data and inputs that are derived from similar instruments. Based on this valuation, the unrealized holding loss against the cost basis in the investments at December31, 2011 was $4.7million. The unrealized holding loss has been reported in other comprehensive income and the impact of the unrealized holding loss is recorded in the net $70.9million investment balance in auction rate securities. If the required rate of return we used in the calculation model was 100 basis points higher, the resulting holding loss would have been approximately $4.2million higher. We may need to recognize either additional holding gains or losses in other comprehensive income or holding losses in net earnings should changes occur in either the conditions in the credit markets, the credit quality of the issuers, or in the variables considered in our valuation model.
Upon a failed auction, the instrument carries an interest rate based upon certain predefined formulas. A 100 basis point change in the average rate of interest earned on these investments would result in a $0.8million change in pre-tax income on an annual basis.
Interest Rate Fluctuations As of December31, 2011, we had $800.0million of senior notes outstanding with an original maturity date of May1, 2018 and $800.0million of senior notes outstanding with an original maturity date of May1, 2020. The senior notes have fixed interest rates. In addition, we had $13.0million of the Terra 7% senior notes due 2017 outstanding. The fair value of our long-term debt at December31, 2011 was approximately $1.9billion. Our senior secured revolving credit facility bears a current market rate of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on borrowings under the facility. However, as of December31, 2011, there were no borrowings under the facility.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We are directly exposed to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar, the British pound and the Swiss franc. At the present time, we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to foreign currencies.

Our other nitrogen products include urea liquor, diesel exhaust fluid, or DEF, and aqua ammonia, which are sold primarily to our industrial customers. Our principal products in the phosphate segment are diammonium phosphate, or DAP, and monoammonium phosphate, or MAP.
Our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern United States and other major agricultural areas of the U.S. and Canada. We also export nitrogen fertilizer products from our Donaldsonville, Louisiana manufacturing facilities and phosphate fertilizer products from our Florida phosphate operations through our Tampa port facility, as well as from our joint-venture production facilities in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and the United Kingdom.
The principal customers for both our nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors.
Our principal assets include:  five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in Donaldsonville, Louisiana (the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in North America), Port Neal, Iowa, Courtright, Ontario, Yazoo City, Mississippi and Woodward, Oklahoma;  a 75.3% interest in Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation and Noncontrolling Interest The consolidated financial statements of CFHoldings include the accounts of CF, all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities in which CFHoldings or a subsidiary is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
CFL is a variable interest entity that is consolidated in the financial statements of CFHoldings. CFL owns a nitrogen fertilizer complex in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada and supplies fertilizer products to CF and Viterra Inc. (Viterra). CFIndustries, Inc. owns 49% of CFL's voting common shares and 66% of CFL's nonvoting preferred shares. Viterra owns 34% of the voting common stock and non-voting preferred stock of CFL. The remaining 17% of the voting common stock is owned by GROWMARK, Inc. and La Coop fdre. Viterra's 34% interest in the distributed and undistributed earnings of CFL is included in noncontrolling interest reported in the consolidated statement of operations. The interests of Viterra and the holders of 17% of CFL's common shares are included in noncontrolling interest reported on the consolidated balance sheet.
TNCLP is a master limited partnership that is consolidated in the financial statements of CFHoldings. TNCLP owns the nitrogen manufacturing facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma. Through the acquisition of Terra in April 2010, we own an aggregate 75.3% of TNCLP and outside investors own the remaining 24.7%. Partnership interests in TNCLP are traded on the NYSE. As a result, TNCLP files separate financial reports with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). The outside investors' limited partnership interests in the partnership are included in noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements. This noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling unitholders' interest in the partners' capital of TNCLP.
Revenue Recognition The basic criteria necessary for revenue recognition are: 1)evidence that a sales arrangement exists, 2)delivery of goods has occurred, 3)the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and 4)collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue when these criteria have been met and when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer, which can be at the plant gate, a distribution facility, a supplier location or a customer destination. Revenue from forward sales programs is recognized on the same basis as other sales (when title transfers to the customer) regardless of when the customer advances are received.
The Company offers certain incentives that typically involve rebates if a customer reaches a specified level of purchases. Incentives are accrued monthly and reported as a reduction of net sales. This process is intended to report sales at the ultimate net realized price and requires the use of estimates.
Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are reported in revenue. Shipping and handling costs incurred by us are included in cost of sales. Fees billed to third parties for ancillary throughput and storage services at distribution facilities are reported as a reduction of cost of sales.

Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.
Investments Short-term and noncurrent investments are accounted for primarily as available-for-sale securities reported at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income unless fair value is below amortized cost (i.e.,the investment is impaired) and the impairment is deemed other-than-temporary, in which case, some or all of the decline in value would be charged to earnings. The carrying values of short-term investments approximate fair values because of the short maturities and the highly liquid nature of these investments.
We also hold auction rate securities (ARS), which are primarily debt instruments with long-term maturities for which interest rates are expected to be reset periodically through an auction process. Because the traditional auction process has failed since early 2008, these securities are illiquid and we are not able to access the funds until such time as an auction for these securities is successful, buyers are found outside the auction process, or the securities are redeemed by the issuer. As a result of continuing market illiquidity and our judgment regarding the period of time that may elapse until the traditional auction process resumes or other effective market trading mechanisms develop, we classify our ARS as noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We intend to hold our ARS until a market recovery occurs and, based on our current liquidity position, we do not believe it is likely that these securities will need to be sold prior to their recovery in value. Therefore, we expect to recover our cost basis in the investments. As a result, the unrealized holding loss on the ARS is classified as a temporary impairment and is reported in other comprehensive income.
Also included in our investments are a trust fund and an escrow account that we utilize as a means of complying with regulations and a consent decree pertaining to financial assurance requirements for certain asset retirement obligations (AROs) in Florida. These ARO funds are carried at fair value as noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Contributions to the ARO funds are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flow as investing activities.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are recorded at face amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is an estimate based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions, and a review of the current status of each customer's trade accounts receivable. A receivable is past due if payments have not been received within the agreed upon invoice terms. Account balances are charged-off against the allowance when management determines that it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered.
Accounts receivable includes trade receivables and non-trade receivables such as miscellaneous non-product related billings.
Inventories Fertilizer inventories are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out or average cost basis. Inventory includes the cost of materials, production labor and production overhead. Inventory at warehouses and terminals also includes distribution costs. Net realizable value is reviewed monthly. Fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales.

Investments in and Advances to Unconsolidated Affiliates The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates that we do not consolidate, but over which we exercise significant influence. Profits resulting from sales or purchases with equity method investees are eliminated until realized by the investee or investor, respectively. Losses in the value of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate, which are other than temporary, are recognized when the current fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is reported net of our income tax expense. Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates is included in the Other segment in our segment disclosures.
Our equity method investments for which the results are included in operating earnings consist of: (1)50% ownership interest in PLNL, which operates an ammonia production facility in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and (2)50% interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in Houston, Texas. Our share of the net earnings from these investments is reported as an element of earnings from operations because these operations provide additional production and storage capacity to our operations and are integrated with our supply chain and sales activities in the nitrogen segment.
Our non-operating equity method investments consist of: (1)50% ownership in Keytrade, a fertilizer trading company headquartered near Zurich, Switzerland and (2)a 50% ownership in GrowHow, which operates nitrogen production facilities in the United Kingdom. Our share of the net earnings of these investments is not reported in earnings from operations since these operations do not provide us with additional capacity, nor are these operations integrated within our supply chain. Advances to unconsolidated affiliates are loans made to Keytrade and are classified as held-to-maturity debt securities and are reported at amortized cost.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation, depletion and amortization are computed using the units-of-production method or the straight-line method. Depreciable lives are as follows: Years Mobile and office equipment 4 to 12 Production facilities and related assets 10 to 25 Distribution facilities 10 Mining assets and phosphogypsum stacks 20 Land improvements 10to20 Buildings 10 to 45 We periodically review the depreciable lives assigned to production facilities and related assets, as well as estimated production capacities used to develop units-of-production (UOP) depreciation expense, and we change the estimates to reflect the results of those reviews.
Scheduled inspections, replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at the Company's continuous process manufacturing facilities are referred to as plant turnarounds. Plant turnarounds are accounted for under the deferral method, as opposed to the direct expense or built-in overhaul methods. Under the deferral method, expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property, plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straight-line basis over the period benefited, which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5years. If the direct expense method were used, all turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred. Internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized. Turnaround 83 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. For additional information, see Note20Property, Plant and EquipmentNet.
Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets in order to assess recoverability based on expected future undiscounted cash flows whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment conditions arise. The Company performs its goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year. After analysis, goodwill that is deemed impaired is written down to fair value.
We estimate the fair value for impairment purposes using a discounted cash flow model, multiples of earnings and other factors. Such analysis requires the use of future market assumptions and discount factors which are subjective in nature. Estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the Company's control such as business and economic trends, government regulation and technological changes. We believe that the assumptions used to estimate fair value are appropriate and reasonable.
Intangible assets identified with our acquisition of Terra consist of customer relationships and trademarks, which are being amortized over amortization periods of 18years and 10years, respectively. Our intangible assets are presented in noncurrent other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
Leases Leases are classified as either operating leases or capital leases. Assets acquired under capital leases are depreciated on the same basis as property, plant and equipment. We currently do not have any capital leases. Rental payments, including rent holidays, leasehold incentives, and scheduled rent increases are expensed on a straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the depreciable lives of the corresponding fixed assets or the lease term including any applicable renewals.
Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.
A deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which is considered to not be permanently reinvested. No deferred income taxes have been recorded for the remainder of our investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which we believe to be indefinitely reinvested.

Derivative Financial Instruments Natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, urea and UAN. In accordance with the Natural Gas Acquisition Policy, we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments. The derivative instruments currently used are swaps. These contracts reference primarily NYMEX futures contract prices, which represent fair value at any given time. The contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
Derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings immediately in cost of sales, as we do not apply hedge accounting. The fair values of derivative instruments and related cash collateral are reported on a gross basis rather than on a net basis. For additional information, see Note28Derivative Financial Instruments.
Asset Retirement Obligations Asset Retirement Obligations (AROs) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets. AROs are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value. When initially recognized, the fair value based on discounted future cash flows is recorded both as a liability and an increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. In subsequent periods, depreciation of the asset and accretion of the liability are recorded. For additional information, see Note12Asset Retirement Obligations.
Our most significant AROs are driven by regulations in Florida governing the construction, operation, closure and long-term maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems and site reclamation for the phosphate rock mine in Hardee County, Florida. Other AROs consist of conditional AROs for the Plant City, Bartow and Hardee facilities for which a reasonable basis exists for estimating a settlement date. These AROs relate to cessation of operations, and generally include the removal and disposition of certain chemicals, waste materials, asbestos, equipment, vessels, piping, and storage tanks.
We also have unrecorded AROs at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing complexes and at our distribution and storage facilities, that are conditional upon cessation of operations. These AROs include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals, waste materials, structures, equipment, vessels, piping and storage tanks. Also included are reclamation of land and closure of effluent ponds. A liability has not been recorded for these conditional AROs because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities, which is necessary in order to estimate fair value.
Environmental Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that increase the capacity or extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety or efficiency of the operations, or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized. Liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental liabilities are not discounted.
85 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Stock-based Compensation We grant stock-based compensation awards under the CFIndustries Holdings, Inc. 2009 Equity and Incentive Plan. The awards that have been granted to date are nonqualified stock options and restricted stock. The cost of employee services received in exchange for the awards is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to provide the services. For additional information, see Note30Stock-Based Compensation.
Litigation From time to time, the Company is subject to ordinary, routine legal proceedings related to the usual conduct of its business. The Company also is involved in proceedings regarding public utility and transportation rates, environmental matters, taxes and permits relating to the operations of its various plants and facilities. Accruals for such contingencies are recorded to the extent management concludes their occurrence is probable and the financial impact of an adverse outcome is reasonably estimable. Legal fees are recognized as incurred and are not included in accruals for contingencies. Disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided if the likelihood of occurrence is at least reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, many factors are considered. These factors include, but are not limited to, past history, scientific and other evidence, and the specifics and status of each matter. If the assessment of various factors changes, the estimates may change. Predicting the outcome of claims and litigation, and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals.
Foreign Currency Translation Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates. Translation adjustments resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity. Results of operations of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, the amounts of which are not material, are included in net income. Gains and losses resulting from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in other comprehensive income.
Debt Issuance Costs Costs associated with the issuance of debt are included in other noncurrent assets and are amortized over the term of the related debt. Debt issuance discounts are netted against the related debt and are amortized over the term of the debt using the effective interest method.
3.New Accounting Standards Following are summaries of accounting pronouncements that either were adopted recently or may become applicable to our consolidated financial statements. It should be noted that the accounting standards references provided below reflect the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and related Accounting Standards Updates (ASU).
86 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Recently Adopted Pronouncements In January 2010, the FASB issued a standard pertaining to fair value disclosures (ASU No.2010-06) that requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level1 and Level2 fair value measurements, to describe the reasons for the transfers, and to disclose certain additional information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements of Level3 fair value measurements. This standard also requires an entity to provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements for Level2 and Level3 items. The standard became effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2009, except for the Level3 disclosure of activity, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2010. We adopted the level3 disclosure requirements of this standard as of January1, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In July 2010, the FASB issued a standard to modify the disclosures that an entity provides about the credit quality of its receivables and the related allowance for credit losses (ASU No.2010-20). The standard requires an entity to provide more information about the nature of credit risk inherent in the entity's portfolio of financing receivables, how the risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for credit losses and the changes and reasons for those changes in the allowance for credit losses. As a result, both new and previous disclosures must be disaggregated by portfolio segment or class based on how a company develops its allowance for credit losses and how it manages its credit exposure. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after December15, 2010. The adoption of this standard did not impact our consolidated financial statements.
In December 2010, the FASB issued a standard that pertains to business combinations (ASU No.2010-29) that requires a public entity that presents comparative financial statements to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurs during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. Additionally, the standard expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. We adopted this standard as of December31, 2010. The adoption of this standard did not impact our consolidated financial statements.
In April 2010, the FASB issued a standard that pertains to stock compensation (ASU No.2010-13) that clarifies that an employee share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity's equity shares trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market, performance, or service condition. Therefore, an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity. We adopted this standard as of January1, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not impact our consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Pronouncements In May 2011, the FASB issued a standard that is intended to improve comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards (ASU No.2011-04). This standard clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including (1)the application of the highest and best use valuation premise, (2)the methodology to measure the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity's stockholders' equity, (3)disclosure requirements for quantitative information on Level3 fair value measurements and 87 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
(4)guidance on measuring the fair value of financial instruments managed within a portfolio. In addition, the standard requires additional disclosures of the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs for Level3 securities. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2011. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2011, the FASB issued a standard that pertains to the presentation of comprehensive income (ASU No.2011-05). This standard requires that comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The standard also requires entities to disclose on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net earnings. This standard no longer allows companies to present components of other comprehensive income only in the statement of equity. In December 2011, the FASB deferred the new requirement to present the reclassification components of other comprehensive income to the statement of operations by issuing ASU No.2011-12. A new effective date for this requirement has not been issued. The remaining components of the original ASU No.2011-05 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December15, 2011. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In September 2011, the FASB issued a standard to simplify the process for determining goodwill impairment (ASU No.2011-08). This standard gives an entity the option, as a first step, to assess qualitative factors in determining whether a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test must be performed. If an assessment of qualitative factors leads to a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step test is deemed unnecessary. This standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact our consolidated financial statements.
In December 2011, the FASB issued a standard pertaining to disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities (ASU No.2011-11). This standard requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements, including financial instruments and derivative instruments and the effect these arrangements have on the entity's financial position. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January1, 2013. We have not determined the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.
4.Noncontrolling Interest Canadian Fertilizers Limited (CFL) CFL owns a nitrogen fertilizer complex in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada and supplies fertilizer products to CFIndustries, Inc. and Viterra Inc. (Viterra). CFIndustries, Inc. owns 49% of CFL's voting common shares and 66% of CFL's nonvoting preferred shares. Viterra owns 34% of the voting common stock and non-voting preferred stock of CFL. The remaining 17% of the voting common stock is owned by GROWMARK, Inc. and La Coop fdre. CFL is a variable interest entity which we consolidate in our financial statements. CFL's Medicine Hat complex is the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada, with two world-scale ammonia plants, a world-scale urea plant and on-site storage facilities for both ammonia and urea.
CFL's net sales were $709.6million, $454.0million and $429.2million, for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. CFL's assets and liabilities at December31, 2011 were $528.5million and $479.5million, respectively, and at December31, 2010 were $314.0million and $263.8million, respectively.
88 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
CFIndustries, Inc. operates the Medicine Hat facility pursuant to a management agreement and purchases approximately 66% of the facility's ammonia and urea production pursuant to a product purchase agreement. Both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either CFIndustries, Inc. or CFL upon a twelve-month notice. Viterra has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the remaining 34% of the facility's ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement. To the extent that Viterra does not purchase its 34% of the facility's production, CFIndustries, Inc. is obligated to purchase any remaining amounts. However, since 1995, Viterra has purchased at least 34% of the facility's production each year.
Under the product purchase agreements, both CFIndustries, Inc. and Viterra pay the greater of operating cost or market price for purchases. The product purchase agreements also provide that CFL will distribute its net earnings to CFIndustries, Inc. and Viterra annually based on their respective quantities of product purchased from CFL. The distributions to Viterra are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, as we consider these payments to be similar to dividends. While general creditors of CFL do not have direct recourse to the general credit of CFIndustries, Inc., the product purchase agreement does require CFIndustries, Inc. to advance funds to CFL in the event that CFL is unable to meet its debts as they become due. The amount of each advance would be at least 66% of the deficiency and would be more in any year in which CFIndustries, Inc. purchased more than 66% of Medicine Hat's production. A similar obligation also exists for Viterra. CFIndustries, Inc. and Viterra currently manage CFL such that each party is responsible for its share of CFL's fixed costs and that CFL's production volume is managed to meet the parties' combined requirements. Based on the contractual arrangements, CFIndustries, Inc. is the primary beneficiary of CFL as CFIndustries, Inc. directs the activities that most significantly impact CFL's economic performance and receives at least 66% of the economic risks and rewards of CFL.
In accordance with CFL's governing agreements, CFL's earnings are available for distribution to its members based on approval by CFL's shareholders. A portion of the amounts reported as noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statements of operations represent Viterra's 34% interest in the distributed and undistributed earnings of CFL, while a portion of the amounts reported as noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheets represent the interests of Viterra and the holders of 17% of CFL's common shares.
Because CFL's functional currency is the Canadian dollar, consolidation of CFL results in a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment, which is reported in other comprehensive income (loss).
Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP) TNCLP is a master limited partnership that owns a nitrogen manufacturing facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma. We own an aggregate 75.3% of TNCLP through general and limited partnership interests. Outside investors own the remaining 24.7% of the limited partnership. For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities and earnings of the partnership are consolidated into our financial statements. The outside investors' limited partnership interests in the partnership have been recorded as part of noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements. The noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling unitholders' interest in the equity of TNCLP. CFIndustries is required to purchase all of TNCLP's fertilizer products at market prices as defined in the Amendment to the General and Administrative Services and Product Offtake Agreement, dated September28, 2010.
TNCLP makes cash distributions to the general and limited partners based upon formulas defined within its Agreement of Limited Partnership. Cash available for distribution is defined in the agreement generally as all cash receipts less all cash disbursements, less certain reserves (including reserves for 89 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
future operating and capital needs) established as the general partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary or appropriate. Changes in working capital impact available cash, as increases in the amount of cash invested in working capital items (such as accounts receivable or inventory) reduce available cash, while declines in the amount of cash invested in working capital increase available cash. Cash distributions to the limited partners and general partner vary depending on the extent to which the cumulative distributions exceed certain target threshold levels set forth in the Agreement of Limited Partnership.
In each of the applicable quarters of 2011 and 2010, the minimum quarterly distributions were satisfied, which entitled us, as the general partner, to receive increased distributions on our general partner interests as provided for in the Agreement of Limited Partnership. The earnings attributed to our general partnership interest in excess of the threshold levels for the year ended December31, 2011 and 2010, were $214.2million and $49.0million, respectively.
At December31, 2011, Terra NitrogenGP Inc. (TNGP), the general partner of TNCLP (and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CFIndustries), and its affiliates owned 75.3% of TNCLP's outstanding units. When not more than 25% of TNCLP's issued and outstanding units are held by non-affiliates of TNGP, TNCLP, at TNGP's sole discretion, may call, or assign to TNGP or its affiliates, TNCLP's right to acquire all such outstanding units held by non-affiliated persons. If TNGP elects to acquire all outstanding units, TNCLP is required to give at least 30 but not more than 60days notice of TNCLP's decision to purchase the outstanding units. The purchase price per unit will be the greater of (1)the average of the previous 20 trading days' closing prices as of the date five days before the purchase is announced or (2)the highest price paid by TNGP or any of its affiliates for any unit within the 90days preceding the date the purchase is announced.

Available-for-Sale Short-term Investments At December31, 2010, our short-term investments consisted of a Canadian Treasury Bill with an original maturity of twelve months. These investments are accounted for as available-for-sale securities. The fair value of our short-term investments is based upon the daily quoted market prices for each of our investments.
Natural Gas Derivatives The derivative instruments that we currently use are natural gas swaps. These contracts settle using NYMEX futures price indexes, which represent the basis for fair value at any given time. The contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods. Quoted market prices are observable inputs used to determine the fair value of these instruments. See Note28Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information.
Asset Retirement Obligation Funds In order to meet financial assurance requirements associated with certain asset retirement obligations (AROs) in Florida, we maintain investments in an escrow account established for the benefit of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and a trust established to comply with a Consent Decree entered in 2010 with the U.S. EPA and the FDEP. The investments in the trust and escrow account are accounted for as available-for-sale securities. The fair values of these are based upon daily quoted prices representing the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the investments. See Note12Asset Retirement Obligations, for additional information regarding the trust and escrow accounts. The fair values of the ARO funds approximate their cost bases.

Investments in Auction Rate Securities Auction rate securities (ARS) are primarily debt instruments with long-term maturities for which interest rates are expected to be reset periodically through an auction process, which typically occurred every 7 to 35days. Because the traditional auction process for ARS generally has failed since early 2008, these securities are illiquid and we are not able to access the remaining funds until such time as an auction for these securities is successful, buyers are found outside the auction process, and/or the securities are redeemed by the issuer. During 2011, $34.8million of our ARS were redeemed at par value.
As a result of the continuing market illiquidity and our judgment regarding the period of time that may elapse until the traditional auction process resumes or other effective market trading mechanisms develop, we classify these investments as noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. These ARS have maturities that range up to 36years. As of December31, 2011, the carrying values by range of maturity are as follows: (in millions) 10years up to 20years $ 4.8 20years up to 30years 47.2 30years up to 40years 18.9 $ 70.9 We currently intend to hold our auction rate securities until a market recovery occurs and, based on our current liquidity position, we do not believe it is likely that we will need to sell these securities prior to their recovery in value. Therefore, we expect to recover our amortized cost basis in the investments. As a result, our unrealized holding loss on these securities is classified as a temporary impairment and is reported in other comprehensive income.
Our auction rate securities are accounted for as noncurrent available-for-sale securities. We are unable to use significant observable (Level1 or Level2) inputs to value these investments. Therefore, we use a mark-to-model approach that relies on discounted cash flows, market data and inputs derived from similar instruments to arrive at the fair value of these instruments. This model takes into account, among other variables, the base interest rate, credit spreads, downgrade risks and default/recovery risk, the estimated time required to work out the disruption in the traditional auction process and its effect on liquidity, and the effects of insurance and other credit enhancements. Due to the significant number of unobservable inputs that were used to value our auction rate securities, they are classified as Level3 for purposes of the fair value disclosure requirements.
Nonqualified Employee Benefit Trusts We maintain trusts associated with certain deferred compensation related to nonqualified employee benefits. The investments are accounted for as available-for-sale securities. The fair values of the trusts are based on daily quoted prices representing the NAV of the investments.
Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level3) The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in our consolidated balance sheets for our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level3). These assets currently consist of our investments in auction rate securities. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers 93 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
factors specific to the asset or liability. It is reasonably possible that a change in the estimated fair value for instruments measured using Level3 inputs could occur in the future.

For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the effect of anti-dilutive stock options was insignificant.
7.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We maintain four funded defined benefit pension plans; a U.S. plan and a Canadian plan for CFIndustries and certain subsidiaries, and a U.S. plan and a Canadian plan for the Terra entities acquired in 2010. Three of the four plans are closed to new employees. We also provide group medical insurance benefits to certain retirees. The specific medical benefits provided to retirees vary by group and location.

Our consolidated pension funding contributions for 2012 are estimated to be approximately $19.8million. Actual contributions may vary from estimated amounts depending on changes in assumptions, actual returns on plan assets, changes in regulatory requirements and funding decisions.
The expected future pension and retiree medical benefit payments are as follows: Pension Benefit Retiree Medical (in millions) 2012 $ 33.5 $ 4.7 2013 35.5 5.2 2014 37.4 5.7 2015 39.2 6.2 2016 41.3 6.6 5years thereafter 238.2 36.4 The following assumptions were used in determining the benefit obligations and expense: Pension Plans Retiree Medical 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Weighted average discount rateobligation 4.6 % 5.4 % 6.2 % 4.3 % 5.1 % 5.8 % Weighted average discount rateexpense 5.4 % 6.0 % 6.6 % 5.1 % 5.6 % 6.5 % Weighted average rate of increase in future compensation 4.0 % 4.2 % 5.0 % n/a n/a n/a Weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assetsexpense 6.1 % 6.6 % 7.0 % n/a n/a n/a 97 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
The discount rates are developed for each plan using spot rates derived from a yield curve of high quality (Aa rated or better) fixed income debt securities as of the year-end measurement date to calculate discounted cash flows (the projected benefit obligation) and solving for a single equivalent discount rate that produces the same projected benefit obligation.
The expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on analyses of historical rates of return achieved by equity and non-equity investments, adjusted for estimated plan expenses and weighted by target asset allocation percentages. As of January1, 2012, our weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets is 5.7%.
The health care cost trend rate used to determine the primary (U.S.) retiree medical benefit obligation at December31, 2011 is 8.5% grading down to 5.0% in 2018 and thereafter. At December31, 2010, the trend rate was 9.0%, grading down to 5.0% in 2018 and thereafter. A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate at December31, 2011 would have the following effects: One-Percentage-Point Increase Decrease Effect on: Total of service and interest cost components for 2011 13 % (11 )% Benefit obligation at December31, 2011 11 % (9 )% The objectives of the investment policies governing the pension plans are to administer the assets of the plans for the benefit of the participants in compliance with all laws and regulations, and to establish an asset mix that provides for diversification and considers the risk of various different asset classes with the purpose of generating favorable investment returns. The investment policies consider circumstances such as participant demographics, time horizon to retirement and liquidity needs, and provide guidelines for asset allocation, planning horizon, general portfolio issues and investment manager evaluation criteria. The investment strategies for the plans, including target asset allocations and investment vehicles, are subject to change within the guidelines of the policies.
The current target asset allocation for the CF U.S. plan is 25% equity and 75% non-equity, and for the Terra U.S. plan is 15% equity and 85% non-equity, which have been determined based on analysis of actual historical rates of return and plan needs and circumstances. The equity investments are tailored to exceed the growth of the benefit obligation and are a combination of U.S. and non-U.S. total stock market index mutual funds. The non-equity investments consist primarily of investments in debt securities and money market instruments that are selected based on investment quality and duration to mitigate volatility of the funded status and annual required contributions. The non-equity investments have a duration profile that is similar to the benefit obligation in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on the funded status. This structure is achieved through the use of managed mutual funds and individual securities.
The current target asset allocation for the CF Canadian plan is 60% equity and 40% non-equity, and for the Terra Canadian plan is 25% equity and 75% non-equity. The equity investments are actively managed portfolios that diversify assets across multiple securities, economic sectors and countries. The non-equity investments are high quality actively managed portfolios that diversify assets across economic sectors, countries and maturity spectrums. This structure is achieved through the use of managed mutual funds.

market, which represent the net asset values of the shares held by the plan and are classified as Level1 investments.
(3) The pooled equity funds consist of actively managed pooled funds that invest in common stock and other equity securities that are traded on U.S., Canadian and foreign markets. These funds are valued using net asset values (NAV) as determined by the fund manager, which are based on the value of the underlying net assets of the fund. Although the NAV is not based on quoted market prices in an active market, it is based on observable market data and therefore the funds are categorized as Level2 investments.
(4) U.S. Treasury bonds and notes are valued based on quoted market prices in an active market and are classified as Level1 investments.
(5) The fixed income mutual funds are actively managed bond funds that invest in investment-grade corporate debt, various governmental debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities with varying maturities. They are classified as Level1 if there are quoted market prices in an active market and Level2 if valued using NAV as determined by the fund manager.
(6) Corporate bonds and notes are traded and private placement securities valued by institutional bond pricing services which gather information from market sources and integrate credit information, observed market movements and sector news into their pricing applications and models. These securities are classified as Level2.
(7) Government and agency securities consist of U.S. Federal and other government and agency debt securities which are classified primarily as Level2 securities. Certain agency bonds are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets and are therefore classified as Level1.
(8) Other includes primarily asset-backed securities and certain zero coupon bonds which are valued through pricing models of reputable third party sources based on market data and are classified as Level2 investments.
We have defined contribution plans covering substantially all employees. Under these plans, we contribute a fixed percentage of base salary to employees' accounts and match employee contributions up to specified limits. We contributed $11.8million, $12.7million, and $10.9million to the plans in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
In addition to our qualified defined benefit pension plans, we also maintain certain nonqualified supplemental pension plans for highly compensated employees as defined under federal law. The amounts recognized in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets for these plans were $2.0million and $19.3million at December31, 2011 and $2.4million and $17.1million at December31, 2010, respectively. We recognized expense for these plans of $1.6million, $1.5million and $1.3million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
We maintain incentive compensation plans that cover virtually all employees. The aggregate awards under the plans are based on predetermined targets and can include both financial and operating performance measures. Awards are accrued during the year and paid in the first quarter of the subsequent year. We recognized expense for these plans of $26.2million, $16.5million and $5.0million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Woodward complex was acquired in the Terra acquisition and could produce nitrogen fertilizers and methanol. Based on a strategic review that was completed in the third quarter of 2011, the Woodward complex will focus on fertilizer production. As a result, management approved the permanent shutdown and removal of the methanol plant, and we recognized the impairment charge. The expense is included in the first line of the table above.
In February 2011, we sold four of our owned dry product warehouses to GROWMARK, Inc. (GROWMARK) and realized a pre-tax gain of $32.5million, which is also included in the first line in the table above. For further information on the sale of dry product warehouses, see Note34Related Party Transactions.
Business combination costs include expenses associated with the Terra acquisition, including the $123million termination fee that was paid on behalf of Terra to Yara International ASA. For additional discussion of the Terra acquisition, see Note14Terra Acquisition.
Bartow costs consist of provisions for AROs and site maintenance costs at our closed phosphate fertilizer facility in Bartow, Florida. The AROs involve costs of closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring for the phosphogypsum stack system, and water treatment costs. For additional information on our AROs, see Note12Asset Retirement Obligations.

In December 2009, we sold 2.0million shares of Terra common stock and realized a pre-tax gain of $11.9million. These investments in and subsequent dispositions of Terra common shares were made prior to our acquisition of Terra in April of 2010.
12.Asset Retirement Obligations Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets. Our AROs are primarily associated with phosphogypsum stack systems and mine reclamation in Florida.

Our liability for phosphogypsum stack system costs includes the cost of stack closure at Plant City and the costs of cooling pond closure, post-closure monitoring, and ongoing water treatment at both Bartow and Plant City. The actual amounts to be spent will depend on factors such as the timing of activities, refinements in scope, technological developments, cost inflation and changes in regulations. It is possible that these factors could change at any time and impact the estimates. Closure expenditures for the Bartow cooling pond are estimated to occur through 2016. Closure expenditures for the Plant City stack expansion are estimated to occur in the 2033 to 2037 time frame and closure of the Plant City cooling pond is assumed to occur in the year 2087. Additional AROs may be incurred in the future.
The liability for mine reclamation costs is primarily for work involving the re-contouring, re-vegetation and re-establishment of wildlife habitat and hydrology of land disturbed by phosphate rock mining activities. In accordance with regulations in Florida, physical reclamation and restoration of disturbed areas is generally required to be completed within a prescribed time frame after completion of mining operations, and the timing of reconnection to surrounding lands and waterways varies based on achievement of applicable release criteria. The actual time required to complete the work may vary depending on site-specific reclamation plans and other circumstances.
The $15.1million change in estimate in 2010 relates primarily to a change in the reclamation plan at our Hardee County, Florida phosphate rock mine that resulted from changes in cost, scope and timing of reclamation activities. Of this amount, $9.2million was recorded as an increase in property, plant and equipment and $5.9million was charged to earnings.

The $6.0million change in estimate in 2011 relates primarily to changes in the scope of closure activities of our Bartow phosphogypsum stack system and mine reclamation activities at our Hardee County Florida phosphate mine. Of this amount, $6.6million was charged to earnings and an offsetting $0.6million was recorded as a decrease in property, plant and equipment.
Florida regulations require phosphate fertilizer companies to demonstrate financial assurance for the closure and maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems, for mine reclamation activities, and for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures. As a means of complying with such regulations, we maintain an escrow account established for the benefit of the FDEP. In the first quarters of 2010 and 2009, we made annual contributions to this account of $3.7million and $7.5million, respectively. No contribution was necessary in 2011. At December31, 2011, the balance in this escrow account was $13.2million.
In the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a Consent Decree with the EPA and the FDEP (the Plant City Consent Decree) with respect to our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex and its compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). In addition to requirements to modify certain operating practices and undertake certain capital improvement projects, the Plant City Consent Decree requires the Company to provide financial assurance with respect to its ability to fund the closure, long-term maintenance, and monitoring costs for the Plant City phosphogypsum stack, as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we established a trust for the benefit of the EPA and the FDEP, deposited $54.8million into the trust and transferred $26.9million from our previously established escrow account described above. In October 2011, we made an additional contribution of $50.4million and we currently expect to deposit approximately the same amount in 2012, at which point the trust will be fully funded. Additional funding may be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed investment earnings in the trust. At December31, 2011, the balance in the trust was $132.2million.
Prior to the Plant City Consent Decree, the Company's financial assurance requirements for the closure, water treatment, long-term maintenance, and monitoring costs for the Plant City phosphogypsum stack system were determined solely by Florida regulations that would have required funding of the escrow account over a period of years. The Plant City Consent Decree described above effectively requires the Company to fund the greater of the requirements under the Plant City Consent Decree or Florida law, which may vary over time. We are still required under Florida law to maintain the existing Florida escrow account for the closure, long-term maintenance, and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stack system at our closed Bartow phosphate complex.
We have unrecorded AROs at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations. These AROs include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals, waste materials, structures, equipment, vessels, piping and storage tanks. Also included is reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds. The most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these AROs expressed in 2011 dollars is $47.0million. We have not recorded a liability for these conditional AROs at December31, 2011 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities, which is necessary in order to estimate fair value. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance, asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment, which if conducted as in the past, can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities indefinitely. We also considered the possibility of changes in technology, risk of obsolescence, and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion.

If this investment is realized as the result of distributions or otherwise, the Company will be subject to additional U.S. and foreign income taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of such taxes.
Uncertain Tax Positions the Company files federal, provincial, state and local income tax returns principally in the United States and Canada. In general, filed tax returns remain subject to examination by United States tax jurisdictions for years 2001 and thereafter and by Canadian tax jurisdictions for years 2003 and thereafter.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: December31, 2011 2010 (in millions) Unrecognized tax benefits: Beginning balance $ 111.5 $ 89.1 Additions resulting from the Terra acquisition  17.4 Additions for tax positions taken during the current year 0.4 5.0 Additions for tax positions taken during prior years 30.1  Reductions related to settlements with tax jurisdictions (4.9 )  Ending balance $ 137.1 $ 111.5 Unrecognized tax benefits increased in 2011 by $30.1million as the result of tax return positions taken in prior years. The Company also has unrecognized tax benefits as the result of the Terra acquisition in the amount of $17.4million. Our effective tax rate would be affected by $47.5million if these unrecognized tax benefits were to be recognized in the future. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the amounts of these unrecognized tax benefits may change significantly within the next twelve months as a result of reviews by tax jurisdictions. An estimate of the amount, or range of amounts, of the possible change cannot be made.
In connection with our initial public offering (IPO) in August 2005, CFIndustries, Inc. (CFI) ceased to be a non-exempt cooperative for income tax purposes, and we entered into a net operating loss agreement (NOL Agreement) with CFI's pre-IPO owners relating to the future utilization of the pre-IPO net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally determined that the NOLs can be utilized to offset applicable post-IPO taxable income, we will pay the pre-IPO owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved.
A portion of the pre-IPO NOL was realized in 2011 as the result of the completion of a federal examination of the Company's final tax year as a cooperative. As a result, our uncertain tax benefits decreased by $4.9million. For the year ended December31, 2010, we took tax return positions utilizing the remaining portion of the NOLs. As the result of these return positions, our unrecognized tax benefits increased by $4.5million. The amount of the unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2011 related to realization of the NOLs which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, is $24.2million. The remainder of the unrecognized tax benefits, if received, will be payable to the pre-IPO owners under the NOL Agreement. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits related to the utilization of the NOLs may change significantly within the next twelve months as a result of the review of amended income tax returns by tax jurisdictions. An estimate of the amount, or range of amounts, of the possible decrease cannot be made.
Valuation Allowance a foreign subsidiary of the Company has net operating loss carryovers of $174.0million that are indefinitely available in the foreign jurisdiction. As the future realization of these losses is not anticipated, a valuation allowance of $48.7million has been recorded. Of this amount, $16.7million and $12.0million were recorded as valuation allowances for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $20.0million was recorded as the result of the Terra acquisition. A valuation allowance of $13.1million was recorded in the year ended December31, 2011 due to the uncertainty of the realization of certain deferred tax assets. The Company has other net operating losses in foreign and state tax jurisdictions for which realization is also not anticipated. A valuation allowance of $6.1million was recorded as the result of the Terra acquisition for these net operating losses.
108 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Interest expense and penalties of $13.9million and $3.1million principally related to uncertain tax benefits were recognized for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. No interest expense or penalties were recognized for the year ended December31, 2009. Amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets for accrued interest and penalties related to income taxes of $25.0million and $11.8million are included in other noncurrent liabilities as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
CFL operates as a cooperative for Canadian income tax purposes and distributes all of its earnings as patronage dividends to its customers, including CFI. For Canadian income tax purposes, CFL is permitted to deduct an amount equal to the patronage dividends it distributes to its customers, provided that certain requirements are met. As a result, CFL records no income tax provision.
14.Terra Acquisition In April of 2010, we completed the acquisition of Terra through the merger of Composite Merger Corporation, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary (Composite), with and into Terra pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March12, 2010 among CFHoldings, Composite and Terra (the Merger Agreement). As a result of the merger, Terra became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The acquisition of Terra has made the Company a global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer industry, diversified our asset base and increased our geographic reach and operational efficiency, and significantly increased our scale and capital market presence.
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Terra common stock was converted into the right to receive $37.15 in cash and 0.0953 of a share of CFHoldings common stock pursuant to an exchange offer and second-step merger (the Merger). CFHoldings issued an aggregate of 9.5million shares of its common stock with a fair value of $882million and paid an aggregate of $3.2billion in cash, net of $0.5billion cash acquired, for 100% of Terra's common stock.
We funded the cash requirements of the acquisition with cash on hand and with $1.75billion of borrowings under a senior secured bridge facility and approximately $1.9billion of borrowings under a senior secured term loan facility that provided for up to $2.0billion of borrowings. On April21, 2010, CFHoldings completed a public offering of approximately 12.9million shares of common stock at $89.00 per share. The proceeds of $1.1billion, net of underwriting discounts and customary fees, were used to repay a portion of the senior secured bridge facility. On April23, 2010, CFIndustries completed a public offering of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1.6billion. Approximately $645.2million of the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay in full the remaining outstanding borrowings under the senior secured bridge facility. We used the remaining proceeds from the offering to repay approximately $864.2million of the senior secured term loan facility. In May 2010, we redeemed Terra's 7.75% senior notes due 2019 for $744.5million and recognized a $17million loss on the early extinguishment of that debt. See Note25Financing Agreements, for further information regarding these financing arrangements.

All transactions costs, including the $123million termination fee we paid, on behalf of Terra, to Yara International ASA (see Note8Other OperatingNet for further details) have been reflected as an adjustment in the pro forma results for the year ended December31, 2009. The pro forma results do not include any synergies or other effects of the integration of Terra. Adjustments to conform certain accounting policies have not been reflected in the supplemental pro forma results due to the impracticability of estimating such impacts. Accordingly, such pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results that actually would have occurred had the acquisition been completed on the date indicated.
Purchase price and fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed The following table summarizes the allocation of the $4.6billion purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Terra on April5, 2010. During the measurement period that ended on March31, 2011, net adjustments of $31.9million were made to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price recorded in the second quarter of 2010, and the net adjustments, are shown below. Our consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2010 was retrospectively adjusted to reflect these 110 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

The restructuring costs relate to employee termination benefits. The integration costs relate to our incremental costs, such as consulting and other professional fees, directly related to integrating Terra.
Our restructuring and integration costs consist of the following: Year ended December31, 2011 2010 (in millions) Integration $ 2.0 $ 14.7 Restructuring 2.4 6.9 Total $ 4.4 $ 21.6 In connection with the acquisition of Terra in 2010, our management approved a restructuring plan that involves the consolidation of our corporate headquarters, including the closure of our Sioux City, Iowa offices. The total cost recorded in connection with the plan was $9.3million, which includes employee termination costs associated with the elimination of 105 positions. As of December31, 2011, all of those employees had been notified that their positions have been or will be eliminated. We do not expect to incur any material costs in connection with our existing restructuring plan during 2012.

We include our share of the net earnings from these investments as an element of earnings from operations because these operations provide additional production and storage capacity to our operations and are integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities in the nitrogen segment.

The combined results of operations and financial position for our operating equity method investments are summarized below: Year ended December31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Condensed statement of operations information: Net sales $ 347.2 $ 172.6 $  Net earnings $ 117.5 $ 52.3 $  Equity in earnings of operating affiliates $ 50.2 $ 10.6 $  December31, 2011 2010 (in millions) Condensed balance sheet information: Current assets $ 126.6 $ 120.6 Noncurrent assets 147.2 147.4 Total assets $ 273.8 $ 268.0 Current liabilities $ 41.1 $ 33.0 Long-term liabilities 24.2 26.0 Equity 208.5 209.0 Total liabilities and equity $ 273.8 $ 268.0 The carrying value of these investments at December31, 2011 was $413.1million, which was $308.9million more than our share of the affiliates' book value. The excess is primarily attributable to the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, the value of an exclusive natural gas contract and goodwill. The increased basis for property, plant and equipment and the gas contract are being amortized over a remaining period of approximately 22years and 12years, respectively. Our equity in earnings of operating affiliates is different from our ownership interest in income reported by the unconsolidated affiliates due to amortization of basis differences.
We have transactions in the normal course of business with PLNL reflecting our obligation to purchase 50% of the ammonia produced by PLNL at current market prices. We purchased approximately $161.9million and $92.1million of ammonia from PLNL in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
At December31, 2011, the amount of our consolidated retained earnings that represents our undistributed earnings of operating equity method investments is insignificant.
Non-Operating Equity Method Investments Our non-operating equity method investments consist of: (1)a 50% ownership of KEYTRADE AG (Keytrade), a fertilizer trading company headquartered near Zurich, Switzerland; and (2)a 50% ownership in GrowHow UK Limited (GrowHow), which operates nitrogen production facilities in the United Kingdom. We do not include the net earnings of these investments in earnings from operations since these operations do not provide additional capacity to us, nor are these operations integrated within our supply chain. GrowHow is a joint venture between us and Yara International ASA.

At December31, 2011 and 2010, the amount of the outstanding advances to Keytrade on our consolidated balance sheets was $12.4million. For the twelve months ended December31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized interest income on advances to Keytrade of $0.2million. The carrying value of our advances to Keytrade approximates fair value.
Excluding the advances to Keytrade, the carrying value of our non-operating equity method investments at December31, 2011 was $503.1million, which exceeded our share of the affiliates' book value by $348.7million. The excess is attributable to the impact of our acquisition of Terra and reflects primarily the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangibles and goodwill. The increased basis for fixed assets and identifiable intangibles are being amortized over periods ranging from 2 to 14years. Our equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates is different than our ownership interest in their net earnings due to the amortization of basis differences.
At December31, 2011, the amount of our consolidated retained earnings that represents our undistributed earnings of non-operating equity method investments is $16.1million.

Scheduled inspections are also conducted during full plant shutdowns, including required safety inspections which entail the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers, pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications. Internal employee costs and overhead are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized.

Other includes accrued utilities, property taxes, sales incentives and other credits, maintenance and professional services.
24.Customer Advances Customer advances represent cash received from customers following acceptance of orders under the Company's forward sales programs. Such advances typically represent a significant portion of the contract's sales value and are generally collected by the time the product is shipped, thereby reducing 118 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
or eliminating accounts receivable from customers upon shipment. Revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers.
25.Financing Agreements Long-term debt consisted of the following: December31, 2011 2010 (in millions) Term loan $  $ 341.1 Unsecured senior notes: 6.875% due 2018 800.0 800.0 7.125% due 2020 800.0 800.0 7.0% due 2017 13.0 13.0 $ 1,613.0 $ 1,954.1 Less: Current portion   Net long-term debt $ 1,613.0 $ 1,954.1 Credit Agreement On April5, 2010, the Company, as a guarantor, and CFIndustries, as borrower, entered into a $2.3billion senior Credit Agreement with certain lenders, including Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (MSSF), and MSSF as agent for such lenders and as collateral agent (the Credit Agreement), which provided for multiple-draw term loans (Term Loans) of up to $2.0billion (collectively, the Term Facility) through the date of the Merger (see Note14Terra Acquisition) and a revolving credit facility of up to $500million (the Revolving Credit Facility). All loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on an applicable margin over LIBOR or a base rate. The Credit Agreement initially was to expire on April5, 2015 (see the Amendment discussed below).
CFIndustries borrowed approximately $1.9billion in the form of Term Loans to finance, in part, the acquisition of Terra; to refinance certain indebtedness of Terra and its subsidiaries; and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing. In the second quarter of 2010, we repaid approximately $864.2million of the Term Loan borrowings with proceeds from the issuance of the CFIndustries senior notes described in this Note25 under "Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020." In 2010, we also repaid an additional $650million of the Term Loan borrowings and, in the first quarter of 2011, we repaid the remaining balance of the Term Loan, both with cash from operations.
On August3, 2011, we completed an amendment (the Amendment) to the Credit Agreement to accomplish the following: increase the amounts of indebtedness permitted to be incurred under certain secured and unsecured indebtedness baskets that are not to exceed a percentage of consolidated total assets and, in certain cases, are subject to compliance with a maximum leverage ratio; permit certain investments if the Company is in compliance with a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio; and increase the amounts available in certain dividend and other restricted payment baskets. In addition, the Amendment extended the maturity date of the Credit Agreement an additional year to 2016 and replaced the leverage-based pricing with corporate credit ratings based pricing for both the commitment fee and interest rate margin.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries (subject to certain limitations). At December31, 2011, there was $491.2million of available credit under the Revolving Credit Facility (net 119 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
of outstanding letters of credit), and there were no borrowings outstanding. The Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio and includes other customary terms and conditions, including negative covenants and events of default.
The obligations of CFIndustries under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and certain direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, the Guarantors). The obligations of CFIndustries and the Guarantors under the Credit Agreement are secured by senior liens on substantially all of the assets of CFIndustries and the Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. The Amendment described above permits the release of liens on substantially all of the assets securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement if the Company obtains certain credit ratings from S&P and Moody's.
Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020 On April23, 2010, CFIndustries issued $800million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes) and $800million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes and, together with the 2018 Notes, the Notes).
The 2018 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.875% per annum, payable semiannually on May1 and November1, mature on May1, 2018 and are redeemable at CFIndustries' option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a specified make-whole redemption price.
The 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.125% per annum, payable semiannually on May1 and November1, mature on May1, 2020 and are redeemable at CFIndustries' option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a specified make-whole redemption price.
The indentures governing the Notes contain customary events of default and covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, including CFIndustries, to incur liens on certain properties to secure debt. In the event of specified changes of control involving the Company or CFIndustries, they also require CFIndustries to offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The Notes are guaranteed by the Company and each of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries (other than CFIndustries) that is a borrower or guarantor under the Credit Agreement. The guarantees are joint and several. The guarantees will be released with respect to a series of Notes upon satisfaction of the indenture requirements for legal defeasance with respect to the notes of such series or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture with respect to such series. In addition, the guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor will be automatically released with respect to a series of notes upon the release, discharge or termination of such guarantor's guarantee of the Credit Agreement.
At December31, 2011, the carrying value of the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes was $1.6billion and the fair value was approximately $1.9billion.
Terra Senior Notes In February 2007, Terra issued $330million of 7% Senior Notes due 2017 (2017 Notes). In October 2009, Terra repurchased approximately $317.5million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes in a tender offer and consent solicitation, and as a result, substantially all of the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the 2017 Notes were eliminated. At December31, 2011, the carrying value of the 2017 Notes that remain outstanding was $13.0million, which approximates fair value.
120 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes Payable From time to time, CFL receives advances from CFIndustries and from CFL's noncontrolling interest holder to finance major capital expenditures. The advances outstanding are evidenced by unsecured promissory notes due December31, 2013 and bear interest at market rates. The amount shown as notes payable represents the advances payable to CFL's noncontrolling interest holder. The carrying value of notes payable approximates their fair value.
26.Leases We have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements, the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the distribution of fertilizer. The rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to ten years and the barge charter commitments range from one to four years. We also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for our distribution system, some of which contain minimum throughput requirements. The storage agreements contain minimum terms generally ranging from one year to three years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party.
Our Deerfield corporate office lease has a ten-year minimum term ending in 2017. This lease contains rent escalations, leasehold incentives and rent holidays that are amortized on a straight-line basis over the construction period and the term of the lease. Other than the corporate office lease, our operating lease agreements do not contain significant contingent rents, leasehold incentives, rent holidays, concessions or unusual provisions.
Future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases, including barge charters and storage agreements at December31, 2011 are shown below.

27.Other Noncurrent Liabilities Other noncurrent liabilities consist of the following: December31, 2011 2010 (in millions) Asset retirement obligations $ 131.6 $ 119.8 Less: Current portion in accrued expenses 13.8 8.1 Noncurrent portion 117.8 111.7 Benefit plans and deferred compensation 230.4 189.9 Tax related liabilities 74.8 31.1 Environmental and related costs 4.6 6.5 Deferred rent 2.7 2.9 Other 5.5 1.1 $ 435.8 $ 343.2 Asset retirement obligations are for phosphogypsum stack closure, mine reclamation and other obligations (see Note12Asset Retirement Obligations). Benefit plans and deferred compensation include liabilities for pensions, retiree medical benefits, and the noncurrent portion of incentive plans (see Note7Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits). Environmental and related costs consist of the noncurrent portions of the liability for environmental items included in other operating costs (see Note8Other OperatingNet).
28.Derivative Financial Instruments We use natural gas in the manufacture of nitrogen fertilizer products. We manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments covering periods of generally less than 18months. We use natural gas derivative instruments primarily to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on sales under our Forward Pricing Program. Our natural gas acquisition policy also allows us to establish derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our Forward Pricing Program.
The derivative instruments that we currently use are primarily natural gas swap contracts. These contracts settle using primarily a NYMEX futures price index, which represents fair value at any given time. The contracts are entered into with respect to gas to be consumed in the future and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases used to manufacture nitrogen products during those future periods.
We report derivatives on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognized immediately in earnings, unless the normal purchase and sale exemption applies. We use natural gas derivatives primarily as an economic hedge of gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur. Cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities.
122 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
The effect of derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations is shown below. All amounts arise from natural gas derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments, with resulting gains and losses recorded in cost of sales.
Year ended December31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Realized losses $ (54.5 ) $ (53.2 ) $ (115.6 ) Unrealized mark-to-market gains (losses) (77.3 ) 9.6 87.5 Net derivative losses $ (131.8 ) $ (43.6 ) $ (28.1 ) The fair values of derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets are shown below. All amounts arise from natural gas derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. For additional information on derivative fair values, see Note5Fair Value Measurements.
December31, 2011 2010 (in millions) Unrealized gains in other current assets $ 0.5 $ 6.6 Unrealized losses in other current liabilities (74.7 ) (3.5 ) Net unrealized derivative gains (losses) $ (74.2 ) $ 3.1 As of December31, 2011 and 2010, we had open derivative contracts for 156.3million MMBtus and 51.8million MMBtus, respectively, of natural gas. For the year ended December31, 2011, we used derivatives to cover approximately 66% of our natural gas consumption.
Natural gas derivatives involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts. The counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions. Cash collateral is deposited with or received from counterparties when predetermined unrealized gain or loss thresholds are exceeded. At December31, 2011, we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts. At December31, 2010, we had cash collateral of $2.6million on deposit with derivative counterparties.
As of December31, 2011 and 2010, the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was $74.7million and $0.7million, respectively, for which we had no cash collateral on deposit with these counterparties.
For derivatives that are in net asset positions, we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties. At December31, 2011 and 2010, our exposure to credit loss from nonperformance by counterparties to derivative instruments totaled $0.5million and $6.4million, respectively. We control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties, individual credit limits, monitoring procedures, cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements.
The master netting arrangements with respect to our derivative instruments also contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require us to maintain a minimum net worth level and certain financial ratios. If we fail to meet these minimum requirements, the counterparties to derivative instruments that are in net liability positions could require daily cash settlement of unrealized losses or some other form of credit support.

29.Stockholders' Equity Common Stock On August4, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase Company common stock for a total expenditure of up to $1.5billion plus program expenses. Repurchases under this program were authorized to be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise through December31, 2013. During the year ended December31, 2011, we repurchased 6.5million shares under the program for $1.0billion.
In April 2010, we issued approximately 9.5million shares of common stock in connection with our acquisition of Terra. For additional information regarding the Terra acquisition, see Note14Terra Acquisition. Also in April 2010, we completed a public offering of approximately 12.9million shares of common stock at a price of $89.00 per share resulting in net proceeds of $1.1billion.
Changes in common shares outstanding are as follows: Year ended December31, 2011 2010 2009 Beginning balance 71,267,185 48,569,985 48,391,584 Exercise of stock options 638,926 187,599 164,200 Issuance of restricted stock (a) 32,867 58,275 19,031 Forfeitures of restricted stock (3,140 ) (13,380 ) (4,830 ) Issuance for Terra acquisition  9,543,356  Issuance for equity offering  12,921,350  Purchase of treasury shares (b) (6,515,849 )   Ending balance 65,419,989 71,267,185 48,569,985 (a) Consists of restricted shares issued, net of shares issued from treasury.
(b) Includes treasury shares acquired through shares withheld to pay employee tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock.
Dividend and Share Repurchase Restrictions Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock is limited by restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement. Dividends and share repurchases are types of restricted payment that are subject to an annual limit certain investments including acquisitions, and restricted payments. However, these restrictions decline as cumulative retained cash flow, as defined in the agreement, exceeds certain thresholds.
Stockholder Rights Plan We have adopted a stockholder rights plan (the Rights Plan). The existence of the rights and the Rights Plan is intended to deter coercive or partial offers which may not provide fair value to all stockholders and to enhance our ability to represent all of our stockholders and thereby maximize stockholder value.
Under the Rights Plan, each share of common stock has attached to it one right. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of a series of our preferred stock designated as SeriesA junior participating preferred stock at an exercise price of $90, subject to adjustment. Rights will only be exercisable under limited circumstances specified in the rights 124 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
agreement when there has been a distribution of the rights and such rights are no longer redeemable by us. A distribution of the rights would occur upon the earlier of (i)10 business days following a public announcement that any person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more (or, in the case of certain institutional and other investors, 20% or more) of the outstanding shares of our common stock, other than as a result of repurchases of stock by us; or (ii)10 business days, or such later date as our Board of Directors may determine, after the date of the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in any person, group or related persons acquiring beneficial ownership of 15% or more (or, in the case of certain institutional and other investors, 20% or more) of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The rights will expire at 5:00P.M. (NewYork City time) on July21, 2015, unless such date is extended or the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by us.
If any person or group acquires shares representing 15% or more (or, in the case of certain institutional and other investors, 20% or more) of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the rights will entitle a holder, other than such person, any member of such group or related person, all of whose rights will be null and void, to acquire a number of additional shares of our common stock having a market value of twice the exercise price of each right. If we are involved in a merger or other business combination transaction, each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right's then-current exercise price, a number of shares of the acquiring or surviving company's common stock having a market value at that time of twice the right's exercise price.
The description and terms of the rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement dated as of July21, 2005, between us and The Bank of NewYork, as amended by the First Amendment to the Rights Agreement, dated as of August31, 2010, between us and Mellon Investor Services, LLC (as successor to the Bank of NewYork), as Rights Agent.
Preferred Stock We are authorized to issue 50million shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors, without any further stockholder action or approval, to issue these shares in one or more classes or series, and to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued class or series and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions. In connection with our Rights Plan, 500,000shares of preferred stock have been designated as SeriesA junior participating preferred stock. No shares of preferred stock have been issued.

For additional information, see Note11Other Non-OperatingNet.
The $38.7million unrealized gain on securities in 2009 consists primarily of a reduction in the unrealized loss on our auction rate securities during the period and a net unrealized holding gain on our investment in marketable equity securities. See Note5Fair Value Measurements, for additional information on our investments in auction rate securities and investment in marketable equity securities.
30.Stock-Based Compensation 2009 Equity and Incentive Plan On April21, 2009, our stockholders approved the CFIndustries Holdings, Inc. 2009 Equity and Incentive Plan (the Plan), which replaced the CFIndustries Holdings, Inc. 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan (the 2005 Plan). Under the Plan, we may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards (payable in cash or stock) and other stock-based awards to our officers, employees, consultants and independent contractors (including non-employee directors). The purpose of the Plan is to provide an incentive for our employees, officers, consultants and non-employee directors that is aligned with the interests of our stockholders.
126 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Share Reserve and Individual Award Limits The maximum number of shares reserved for the grant of awards under the Plan is the sum of (i)3.9million and (ii)the number of shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2005 Plan to the extent such awards terminate or expire without delivery of shares. For purposes of determining the number of shares of stock available for grant under the Plan, each option or stock appreciation right is counted against the reserve as one share. Each share of stock granted, other than an option or a stock appreciation right, is counted against the reserve as 1.61shares. If any outstanding award expires for any reason or is settled in cash, any unissued shares subject to the award will again be available for issuance under the Plan. Shares tendered in payment of the exercise price of an option and shares withheld by the Company or otherwise received by the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations are not available for future grant under the Plan. At December31, 2011, we had 3.3million shares available for future awards under the Plan. The Plan provides that no more than 1.0million underlying shares may be granted to a participant in any one calendar year.
Stock Options Under the Plan, we granted to plan participants nonqualified options to purchase shares of our common stock. The exercise price of these options is equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The contractual life of the options is ten years and generally one-third of the options vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant.
The fair value of each stock option award is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Key assumptions used and resulting grant date fair values are shown in the following table.
2011 2010 2009 Assumptions: Weighted-average expected volatility 53% 52% 54% Expected term of stock options 4.7Years 5-6Years 4-5Years Risk-free interest rate 0.9% 1.5-2.0% 2.3-2.9% Weighted-average expected dividend yield 1.1% 0.5% 0.5% Weighted-average grant date fair value per share of options granted $56.60 $35.04 $37.24 The expected volatility of our stock options is based on the combination of the historical volatility of our stock and implied volatilities of exchange traded options on our stock. The expected term of options is estimated based on our historical exercise experience, post vesting employment termination behavior and the contractual term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Strip yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the options.

Restricted Stock The fair value of a restricted stock award is equal to the numbers of shares awarded multiplied by the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock awarded to key employees vests three years from the date of grant. The restricted stock awarded to non-management members of our Board of Directors vests the earlier of one year from the date of the grant or the date of the next annual stockholder meeting. During the vesting period, the holders of the restricted stock are entitled to dividends and voting rights.

The following table summarizes stock-based compensation costs and related income tax benefits.
YearendedDecember31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Stock-based compensation expense $ 9.9 $ 7.9 $ 6.6 Income tax benefit (3.7 ) (2.9 ) (2.4 ) Stock-based compensation expense, net of income taxes $ 6.2 $ 5.0 $ 4.2 As of December31, 2011, pre-tax unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, was $10.8million for stock options, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1years, and $5.9million for restricted stock, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0years.
An excess tax benefit is generated when the realized tax benefit from the vesting of restricted stock, or a stock option exercise, exceeds the previously recognized deferred tax asset. Excess tax benefits are required to be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than a reduction of taxes paid. The excess tax benefits in 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $47.2million, $5.8million and $4.6million, respectively.
In addition to the foregoing, we recognized stock-based compensation expense for TNCLP phantom units provided to non-employee directors of TNGP of $0.7million and $0.4million for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Environmental Florida Environmental Matters Clean Air Act Investigation On March19, 2007, the Company received a letter from the EPA under Section114 of the Federal Clean Air Act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with New Source Review, New Source Performance Standards, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants at the Plant City facility. The Company provided the requested information to the EPA in late 2007. The EPA initiated this same process in relation to numerous other sulfuric acid plants and phosphoric acid plants throughout the nation, including other facilities in Florida.
The Company received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA by letter dated June16, 2010. The NOV alleges the Company violated the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Clean Air Act regulations relating to certain projects undertaken at the Plant City facility's sulfuric acid plants. This NOV further alleges that the actions that are the basis for the alleged PSD violations also resulted in violations of TitleV air operating permit regulations. Finally, the NOV alleges that the Company failed to comply with certain compliance dates established by hazardous air pollutant regulations for phosphoric acid manufacturing plants and phosphate fertilizer production plants. The Company had an initial meeting with the EPA to discuss these alleged violations. This matter has been referred to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). The Company does not know at this time if it will settle this matter prior to initiation of formal legal action.
We cannot estimate the potential penalties, fines or other expenditures, if any, that may result from the Clean Air Act NOV and, therefore, we cannot determine if the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
EPCRA/CERCLA Investigation Pursuant to a letter from the DOJ dated July28, 2008 that was sent to representatives of the major U.S. phosphoric acid manufacturers, including CFIndustries, the DOJ stated that it and the EPA believe that apparent violations of Section313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires annual reports to be submitted with respect to the use of certain toxic chemicals, have occurred at all of the phosphoric acid facilities operated by these manufacturers. The letter also states that the DOJ and the EPA believe that most of these facilities have violated Section304 of EPCRA and Section103 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) by failing to provide required notifications relating to the release of hydrogen fluoride from these facilities. The letter did not specifically identify alleged violations at our Plant City, Florida complex or assert a claim for a specific amount of penalties. The EPA submitted an information request to the Company on February11, 2009, as a follow-up to the July 2008 letter. The Company provided information in response to the agency's inquiry on May14 and May29, 2009.
By letter dated July6, 2010, the EPA issued a NOV to the Company alleging violations of EPCRA and CERCLA. The Company had an initial meeting with the EPA to discuss these alleged violations.

The Company does not know at this time if it will settle this matter prior to initiation of formal legal action.
We do not expect that penalties or fines, if any, that may arise out of the EPCRA/CERCLA matter will have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
On August18, 2009, the EPA entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in Florida. The consent decree was approved by a Federal district court judge on November16, 2009. The EPA adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for Florida lakes and inland flowing waters on November14, 2010. On February18, 2012, the Court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation, but found that the EPA had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious. The Court ordered the EPA to issue proposed or final numeric nutrient criteria for streams by May21, 2012 (subject to the EPA seeking an extension of such time period pursuant to the terms of the 2009 consent decree). Depending on the developments discussed herein, federal or state numeric water quality criteria for lakes and inland flowing waters could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining, manufacturing and distribution operations in Florida.
The federal criteria for lakes and inland flowing waters (excluding the criteria found arbitrary and capricious by the Court) will become effective in March 2012, subject to (i)the EPA's proposed delay in the effective date of the regulation (which may require the approval of the Court) and (ii)the development of numeric nutrient criteria by the State of Florida.
Prior to the February18, 2012 order, the EPA had proposed to stay the effective date of its criteria until June4, 2012 due to the development of numeric nutrient criteria proposed by the State of Florida in December 2011. However, the Court's order stated that the Court must approve an extension of the effective date of the federal rule pursuant to the terms of the consent decree. The nitrogen and phosphorous criteria in the December 2011 rule proposed by the State of Florida are substantially identical to the federal rule, but the state proposal includes biological verification as a component of the criteria and adopts existing nutrient Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) as applicable numeric criteria. The impact of these modifications could be to provide more flexibility with respect to nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits so long as such discharges do not impair the biological health of receiving water bodies. Environmental groups have filed a challenge to the proposed state rule with the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings, which will be reviewed by an administrative law judge in early 2012. If the state numeric criteria are promulgated and approved subsequently by the EPA, the state criteria would result in EPA withdrawing the federal numeric criteria.
The 2009 consent decree also requires the EPA to develop numeric nutrient criteria for Florida coastal and estuarine waters. The development of such criteria has been delayed. The EPA has announced its intention to issue proposed numeric nutrient criteria for these water bodies by March 2012 and a final rule by November 2012. It is unclear the extent to which the February18, 2012 decision will impact this proposed rule. The numeric criteria proposed by the State of Florida, discussed above, include criteria for coastal and estuarine waters and if finally promulgated by the State and approved by the EPA, would also supplant federal standards for such water bodies.
The numeric nutrient criteria regulation is not yet final. However, more stringent limits on wastewater discharge permits could increase our costs or limit our operations and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Louisiana Environmental Matters Clean Air ActSection185 Fee Our Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex is located in a five-parish region near Baton Rouge, Louisiana that, as of 2005, was designated as being in "severe" nonattainment with respect to the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for ozone (the 1-hour ozone standard) pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (the Act). Section185 of the Act requires states, in their state implementation plans, to levy a fee (Section185 fee) on major stationary sources (such as the Donaldsonville facility) located in a severe nonattainment area that did not meet the 1-hour ozone standard by November30, 2005. The fee was to be assessed for each calendar year (beginning in 2006) until the area achieved compliance with the ozone NAAQS.
Prior to the imposition of Section185 fees, the EPA adopted a new ozone standard (the 8-hour ozone standard) and rescinded the 1-hour ozone standard. The Baton Rouge area was designated as a "moderate" nonattainment area with respect to the 8-hour ozone standard. However, because Section185 fees had never been assessed prior to the rescission of the 1-hour ozone standard (rescinded prior to the November30, 2005 ozone attainment deadline), the EPA concluded in a 2004 rulemaking implementing the 8-hour ozone standard that the Act did not require states to assess Section185 fees. As a result, Section185 fees were not assessed against CFIndustries and other companies located in the Baton Rouge area.
In 2006, the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the EPA's position and held that Section185 fees were controls that must be maintained and fees should have been assessed under the Act. In January 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to accept the case for review, making the appellate court's decision final.
In July 2011, the EPA approved a revision to Louisiana's air pollution program that eliminated the requirement for Baton Rouge area companies to pay Section185 fees, based on Baton Rouge's ultimate attainment of the 1-hour standard through permanent and enforceable emissions reductions. EPA's approval of the Louisiana air program revision became effective on August8, 2011. However, a recent decision by the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a similar, but perhaps distinguishable, EPA guidance document regarding alternatives to Section185 fees. At this time, the viability of EPA's approval of Louisiana's elimination of Section185 fees is uncertain. Regardless of the approach ultimately adopted by the EPA, we expect that it is likely to be challenged by the environmental community, the states, and/or affected industries. Therefore, the costs associated with compliance with the Act cannot be determined at this time, and we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Clean Air Act Information Request On February26, 2009, the Company received a letter from the EPA under Section114 of the Act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with New Source Review and New Source Performance Standards at the Donaldsonville facility. The Company has completed the submittal of all requested information. There has been no further contact from the EPA regarding this matter.
Other CERCLA/Remediation Matters From time to time, we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under CERCLA or other environmental 132 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
cleanup laws. In 2002 and in 2009, we were asked by the current owner of a former phosphate mine and processing facility that we are alleged to have operated in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in Georgetown Canyon, Idaho, to contribute to a remediation of this property. We declined to participate in the cleanup. It is our understanding that the current owner conducted a cleanup of the processing portion of the site pursuant to a Consent Judgment with the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ). The current owner could bring a lawsuit against us seeking contribution to the cleanup costs, although we do not have sufficient information to determine whether or when such a lawsuit will be brought. In 2011, we and the current owner received a notice from IDEQ that alleged that we and the current owner were potentially responsible parties for the cleanup of the mine portion of the site. IDEQ requested from each party an indication of its willingness to enter into negotiations for an investigation of the mine portion of the site. The current owner indicated a willingness to negotiate. While reserving all rights and not admitting liability, we also indicated a willingness to negotiate. We are not able to estimate at this time our potential liability, if any, with respect to the remediation of this property. However, based on currently available information, we do not expect that any remedial or financial obligations we may be subject to involving this or other sites will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
33.Segment Disclosures We are organized and managed based on two segments, which are differentiated primarily by their products, the markets they serve and the regulatory environments in which they operate. The two segments are the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment. The Company's management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Selling, general and administrative expenses, other operating and non-operating expenses, interest, and income taxes, are centrally managed and not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

We utilize Keytrade as our exclusive exporter of phosphate fertilizers from North America and importer of UAN products into North America. Profits resulting from sales or purchases with Keytrade are eliminated until realized by Keytrade or us, respectively.
34.Related Party Transactions The former chief executive officer of GROWMARK, William Davisson, and the former president and chief executive officer of CHS, Inc. (CHS), JohnD. Johnson, serve as members of our Board of Directors. As of December31, 2011, GROWMARK was the beneficial owner of less than 1% of our outstanding common stock.
Product Sales CHS accounted for 10%, 11% and 22% of our consolidated net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. GROWMARK accounted for 8%, 7% and 9% of our consolidated net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Note33Segment Disclosures for additional information on sales to CHS and GROWMARK.
In addition to purchasing fertilizer from us, CHS and GROWMARK have contracts with us to store fertilizer products at certain of our warehouses. In connection with these storage arrangements we recognized approximately $0.4million, $0.7million and $0.7million from CHS in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and we recognized $0.4million, $0.4million and $0.2million from GROWMARK in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. GROWMARK also has a terminal sublease with us pursuant to which we pass through to GROWMARK the economics of our underlying terminal lease with a third party. In connection with this terminal sublease, we recognized $0.3million in sublease income in both 2011 and 2010. The sublease income recognized in 2009 was insignificant.
Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable at December31, 2011 and 2010 includes $3.3million and $7.2million, respectively, due from CHS and $2.8million and $4.1million, respectively, due from GROWMARK.
136 Table of Contents CFINDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
Supply Contract We have a multi-year supply contract with GROWMARK relating to purchases of fertilizer products. The term of the supply contract with GROWMARK lasts until June30, 2013 and is extended automatically for successive one-year periods unless a termination notice is given by either party.
The contract specifies a sales target volume and a requirement volume for the first contract year. The requirement volume is a percentage of the sales target volume and represents the volume of fertilizer that we are obligated to sell, and the customer is obligated to purchase, during the first contract year. The sales target volume is subject to yearly adjustment by mutual agreement or, failing such agreement, to an amount specified by us which is not more than 105% of the prior year's sales target volume. The requirement volume is also subject to yearly adjustment to an amount specified by the customer which is not less than 65% or more than 100% of the then applicable sales target volume. The contract also contains a reciprocal "meet or release" provision pursuant to which each party must provide the other party with notice and the opportunity to match a transaction with a third party if such a transaction would impact the party's willingness or ability to supply or purchase, as the case may be, the then applicable sales target volume. The "meet or release" provision may not, however, reduce the requirement volume.
The price for product sold under the supply contract varies depending on the type of sale selected by the customer. The customer may select (i)cash sales at prices that are published in our weekly cash price list, (ii)index sales at a published index price, (iii)forward pricing sales, or (iv)sales negotiated between the parties. The supply contract also provides for performance incentives based on (i)the percentage of the sales target volume actually purchased, (ii)the timing of purchases under our Forward Pricing Program, (iii)the amount of purchases under our Forward Pricing Program and (iv)specifying a requirement volume in excess of the then applicable minimum requirement volume. The prices charged for cash sales, index sales, and forward pricing sales will be the same prices we charge all of our similarly situated customers.
Net Operating Loss Carryforwards In connection with our initial public offering (IPO) in August 2005, CFIndustries, Inc. (CFI) ceased to be a non-exempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes, and we entered into a net operating loss agreement (NOL Agreement) with CFI's pre-IPO owners, including CHS and GROWMARK, relating to the future utilization of the pre-IPO net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally determined that the NOLs can be utilized to offset applicable post-IPO taxable income, we will pay the pre-IPO owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved.

ITEM9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in (i)recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act and (ii)ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, using the criteria set forth in the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December31, 2011. KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company's consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, which appears on the following page.
(b) Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
There have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
In April 2010, CF completed its acquisition of Terra. We continue to integrate policies, processes, technology and operations for the combined company and will continue to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting as we complete our integration activities. Until the companies are fully integrated, we will maintain the operational integrity of each company's legacy internal controls over financial reporting.
The Company is in the process of replacing various business information systems with an enterprise resource planning system from SAP. Implementation will occur over several years in phases. This activity involves the migration of multiple legacy systems and users to a common SAP information platform.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Stockholders CFIndustries Holdings, Inc.: We have audited CFIndustries Holdings, Inc.'s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, CFIndustries Holdings, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of CFIndustries Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011, and our report dated February27, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
