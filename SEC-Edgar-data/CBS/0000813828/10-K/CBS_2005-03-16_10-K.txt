In addition,      CBS.com offers a broad range of informational, entertainment, news and      promotional services. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company will      present its online businesses as part of the Cable Networks and      Television segments.     The Company was organized in Delaware in 1986 for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a predecessor. In 1994, the Company acquired Paramount Communications Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation. On August 10, 1999, Blockbuster Inc. ("Blockbuster") (NYSE: BBI) sold to the public 31 million shares of its Class A common stock at $15 per share. The Company, through its ownership of all of the 144 million shares of Blockbuster Class B common stock outstanding, retains approximately 82% of the total equity value in, and approximately 96% of the combined voting power of, Blockbuster. In 1999, the Company announced that it intended to split-off Blockbuster by offering to exchange all of its shares of Blockbuster common stock for shares of the Company's common stock. The split-off was subject to approval by the Company's Board of Directors and an assessment of market conditions. The Company no longer has any plans for the split-off of Blockbuster.     During 2000 and in the first quarter of 2001, the Company took several important steps to secure its position as a leading global media and entertainment company. Significant transactions included the following:    .  On May 4, 2000, CBS Corporation ("CBS") merged with and into the      Company. At the time of the merger, the Company issued 1.085 shares of      its Class B Common Stock for each share of CBS common stock and 1.085      shares of its Series C Preferred Stock for each share of CBS Series B      preferred stock. The total purchase price of approximately $39.8 billion      represents the issuance of 825.5 million shares                                        I-1 of Viacom Class B Common Stock, 11,004 shares of Viacom Series C      convertible preferred stock (which were subsequently converted into 11.0      million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock), the estimated fair value      of CBS stock options which were assumed by issuing Viacom options, and      estimated transaction costs. In addition, Viacom assumed approximately      $3.7 billion of CBS debt.    .  As a result of its merger with CBS, the Company acquired an approximate      64.2% equity interest in Infinity Broadcasting Corporation ("Infinity      Broadcasting"). On February 21, 2001 Infinity Broadcasting merged with      and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with      the merger, the Company issued 0.592 of a share of Viacom Class B Common      Stock for each issued and outstanding share of Infinity Broadcasting      Class A common stock resulting in the issuance of approximately 232      million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock.    .  On August 24, 2000, Infinity Broadcasting completed the acquisition of      18 radio stations from Clear Channel Communications Inc. for $1.4      billion. The acquisition resulted in Infinity Broadcasting expanding      into five new top 50 radio markets and owning over 180 radio stations.      During June 2000, Infinity Broadcasting completed the acquisition of      Giraudy SA, one of France's largest outdoor advertising companies, for      approximately $400 million. Infinity Broadcasting also acquired SMA      Societa Manifesti ed Affissione S.p.A, one of the leading Italian      outdoor media sales companies, for approximately $90 million.    .  On November 3, 2000, the Company announced an agreement to acquire BET      Holdings II, Inc. ("BET"), which operates the BET: BLACK ENTERTAINMENT      TELEVISION(R) and BET ON JAZZ(R) cable networks. On January 23, 2001,      the Company completed its acquisition of BET for a total purchase price      of approximately $3.0 billion, which principally represents the issuance      of approximately 43.4 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and      the assumption by the Company of approximately $590 million in debt.      Beginning in the first quarter of 2001, BET will be reported in the      Cable Networks segment.     As of March 19, 2001, National Amusements, Inc. ("NAI"), a closely held corporation that owns and operates approximately 1,400 movie screens in the U.S., the U.K. and South America, beneficially owned approximately 68% of the Company's Class A Common Stock, and approximately 11% of the Company's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. NAI is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.     The Company's principal offices are located at 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036 (telephone 212/258-6000).

Generally, the Company's cable networks are offered to customers of cable television operators, distributors of direct-to-home satellite services ("DTH") and other multichannel distributors. Cable television is currently the predominant means of distribution of the Company's program services in the U.S. Internationally, the predominant distribution technology varies territory by territory.

In the U.S., MTVN's owned and operated program services include MTV: MUSIC TELEVISION ("MTV"), MTV's spin-off, MTV2: MUSIC TELEVISION(TM) ("MTV2"), NICKELODEON, NICK AT NIGHT, TV LAND, VH1 MUSIC FIRST ("VH1"), CMT: COUNTRY MUSIC TELEVISION ("CMT"), and TNN: THE NATIONAL NETWORK ("TNN").     MTV's programming consists of music videos and events, augmented by music and general lifestyle information, comedy and dramatic series, animated programs, news specials, interviews, documentaries and other youth-oriented programming appealing primarily to an audience aged 18 to 24. At December 31, 2000 according to the Nielsen Media Research report, MTV reached approximately 77.3 million domestic subscriber households. MTV2, a 24-hour, seven-days-a- week spin-off of MTV, offers a "freeform" music format which features music videos from a broad range of musical genres and artists. MTVN also operates "The Suite from MTV Networks" ("The Suite"), a package of digital television program services, which currently consists of MTV2 and five other music related services, and NOGGIN(R) and two other program services from NICKELODEON. The Suite is offered through DBS distributors and cable operators offering digital technology. During 2000, MTVN also offered THE BOX(R) MUSIC NETWORK, a 24-hour, all music basic cable channel, with technology allowing selection of music videos on a market-by-market basis.

In December 2000, VH1 had                                        I-3 its most successful original movie premiere with A DIVAS CHRISTMAS CAROL. The VH1 SAVE THE MUSIC(R) Foundation, in connection with VH1's cable television and satellite affiliates, restored music education programs to 214 schools in 40 communities while also winning the Governors' Award from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, the George Foster Peabody Award for broadcasting and cable excellence and the Beacon Award presented by the Cable Television Public Affairs Association. At December 31, 2000, according to the Nielsen Media Research report, VH1 reached approximately 74.2 million domestic subscriber households.     CMT is an advertiser-supported, 24-hour cable network which presents country music videos, and related events, lifestyle and entertainment programming. Its programming in 2000 included CMT All ACCESS, a monthly series of concerts featuring country music artists, and special events such as CHICKS MUSIC TELEVISION featuring a variety of programs showcasing the Dixie Chicks.

TNN (formerly TNN: The Nashville Network(R)) is an advertiser-supported general entertainment cable network with a focus on popular lifestyle and entertainment programming. The Company offers TNN in the U.S. and, as a non- advertiser supported service, in Canada. At December 31, 2000, according to the Nielsen Media Research report, TNN reached approximately 79.2 million domestic subscriber households and Mediastat reports TNN's Canadian distribution at 6.3 million households. TNN's programming includes the highly rated series WWF RAW IS WAR, as well as popular movies and favorite off-net television series such as STARSKY AND HUTCH and THE DUKES OF HAZZARD, and sports, including professional bull-riding, motor sports, fishing and other outdoor sports.     MTV FILMS(TM), in association with PARAMOUNT PICTURES, produced THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY which was released by PARAMOUNT PICTURES in 2000, and, with PARAMOUNT PICTURES, is currently producing ORANGE COUNTY. MTV FILMS also produced SAVE THE LAST DANCE, with PARAMOUNT PICTURES, released in January 2001. MTV has also launched lines of home videos, consumer products and books, featuring MTV programming and personalities. In addition, MTV pursues broadcast network and first-run syndication television opportunities through MTV PRODUCTIONS(TM).     Internationally, MTVN owns and operates, participates in as a joint venturer, and licenses third parties to operate, MTVN program services, including MTV and NICKELODEON programming. The MTVN international program services are described in the chart that follows. Most of the MTVN international program services are regionally customized to suit the local tastes of their young adult viewers by the inclusion of local music, programming and on-air personalities, and use of the local language. MTV Networks Europe is Europe's most widely distributed cable and satellite network comprising 16 individual music channels, including MTV (9 regionalized services), VH1 (3 services), MTV2, MTV Extra(TM), MTV Base, and VH1 Classic(TM). The network currently reaches more than 90 million households in Europe via a combination of satellite, cable, and terrestrial distribution.     MTVN, in exchange for cash and advertising time or for promotional consideration only, licenses from record companies music videos for exhibition on MTV, MTV2, VH1, CMT and other MTVN program services. MTVN has entered into multi-year global or regional music video licensing agreements with certain of the major record companies. These agreements generally cover a three to five year period and contain provisions regarding video debut and exclusivity for a limited number of music videos in the U.S. MTVN also is negotiating and expects to renew or initiate additional global or regional license agreements with the other major record companies and independent labels. However, there can be no assurance that such renewals or agreements can be concluded on favorable terms (see "Viacom Segments--Competition--Cable Networks").     MTVN derives revenues principally from two sources: the sale of time on its own networks to advertisers and the license of the networks to cable television operators, DTH and other distributors. The sale of MTVN advertising time is affected by viewer demographics, viewer ratings and market conditions for advertising time. Adverse changes to any of these factors could have an adverse effect on revenues. In addition, continued consolidation among cable operators could have an adverse effect on MTVN's license fee revenue (see "Viacom Segments--Competition--Cable Networks").

SNI owns and operates three commercial-free, premium subscription television program services in the U.S.: SHOWTIME, offering recently released theatrical feature films, original motion pictures and series, family entertainment, and boxing and other special events; THE MOVIE CHANNEL(R), offering recently released theatrical feature films and related programming; and FLIX(R), featuring theatrical feature films primarily from the 70s, 80s and 90s as well as selected other titles. At December 31, 2000, SHOWTIME, THE MOVIE CHANNEL and FLIX, in the aggregate, had approximately 28.4 million subscriptions in the 50 states and certain U.S. territories. SUNDANCE CHANNEL(R), a joint venture (among SNI, an affiliate of Robert Redford and Universal Studios) managed by SNI, is a commercial-free premium subscription television program service in the U.S., dedicated to independent film, featuring top-quality American independent films, documentaries, foreign and classic art films, shorts and animation, with an emphasis on recently released titles.     SNI also owns and operates several multiplexed versions of SHOWTIME and THE MOVIE CHANNEL in the U.S., including SHOWTIME BEYOND(R), a genre-based channel featuring sci-fi, horror and fantasy programming, and SHOWTIME EXTREME(R), a genre-based channel featuring action/adventure programming. On March 1, 2001, SNI launched SHOWTIME NEXT(TM), a channel targeting 18-24 year-olds, SHOWTIME WOMEN(TM), focusing on women in front of and behind the camera, and SHOWTIME FAMILYZONE(TM), a channel featuring no R-rated programming. SNI also transmits a high definition television version of SHOWTIME. In addition, SNI jointly owns an advertiser-supported basic television program service in Spain named SHOWTIME EXTREME(R) with Media Park, S.A., a leader in thematic channel production based in Barcelona. At the end of 2000, SNI entered into a joint venture with Zone Vision Enterprises, Limited, a UK company, for the production and distribution of an advertiser-supported action-oriented basic television program service in Turkey. The channel was launched in January 2001 under the name SHOWTIME(TM).     SNI also provides special events, such as sports and musical events, to licensees on a pay-per-view basis. SHOWTIME EVENT TELEVISION(TM) is a pay-per- view distributor of these special events, including boxing events. This unit has produced and distributed seven of the top ten pay-per-view events of all time, including the top two: Tyson vs. Holyfield I and Holyfield vs. Tyson II. SHOWTIME EVENT TELEVISION has also been instrumental in bringing other events to the viewing public, such as DORITOS PRESENTS DREW CAREY'S IMPROV ALL STARS, as well as numerous music concerts, including THE LAST KISS, SPICE GIRLS IN CONCERT--WILD!, THE BACKSTREET BOYS, TINA TURNER and THE ROLLING STONES.     The costs of acquiring premium television rights to programming and producing original motion pictures and series are the principal expenses of SNI. In order to exhibit theatrical motion pictures on premium subscription television, SNI enters into commitments to acquire rights, with an emphasis on acquiring exclusive rights for SHOWTIME and THE MOVIE CHANNEL, from major or independent motion picture producers and other distributors. SNI's exhibition rights cover the U.S. and may, on a contract-by-contract basis, cover additional territories. SNI has the exclusive U.S. premium subscription television rights to all PARAMOUNT PICTURES' feature films theatrically released beginning January 1, 1998, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain titles from PARAMOUNT PICTURES' film library (see "Viacom Segments-- Entertainment"). SNI also has significant theatrical motion picture license agreements with other motion picture producers and distributors, including Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. ("MGM"), Artisan Pictures Inc., and Buena Vista Television (a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company) for Dimension Films theatrical pictures, covering motion pictures initially theatrically released through dates ranging from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2008. Theatrical motion pictures that are licensed to SNI on an exclusive basis are generally exhibited first on SHOWTIME and THE MOVIE CHANNEL after an initial period or "window" for theatrical, home video and pay-per-view exhibition and before the period commenced for standard broadcast television and basic cable television exhibition. Many of the motion pictures which appear on FLIX have been previously available for standard broadcast and other exhibitions (but are shown on FLIX unedited and commercial-free).     SNI also arranges for the development, production, acquisition and, in many cases, distribution of original programs, series and motion pictures. SNI's original series include RESURRECTION BLVD., the first English-language U.S. dramatic television series that predominantly features Hispanics both in front of and behind the                                        I-6 camera, and SOUL FOOD, a series (based on the theatrical motion picture of the same name) that follows the struggles, rivalries and triumphs of a multi- generational African-American family. SNI's original motion pictures have received numerous industry awards over the years, including the prestigious Golden Globe Award for "Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television" for 2000. As part of its original programming strategy, SNI premiered 30 original motion pictures on SHOWTIME in 2000, and expects to premiere approximately 35 original motion pictures in 2001. The producers of some of SNI's original motion pictures are given an opportunity to seek a theatrical release prior to such pictures' exhibition on SHOWTIME or THE MOVIE CHANNEL. If the producers are not successful in obtaining such a theatrical release, these pictures then premiere in the U.S. on SHOWTIME or THE MOVIE CHANNEL. SNI has entered into and plans to continue to enter into co- financing, co-production and/or co-distribution arrangements with other parties to reduce the net cost to SNI for its original motion pictures. In 2000, Hallmark Entertainment Distribution LLC, PARAMOUNT TELEVISION and MGM were the predominant co-producers, co-financiers and co-distributors of SNI's original motion pictures, programs and series for that calendar year. BLOCKBUSTER and SNI have an agreement whereby BLOCKBUSTER will license from SNI the exclusive domestic home video rights to up to 180 SNI original motion pictures and other programs over the period from April 1, 2000 through March 31, 2005.

The CBS Daytime lineup and the drama THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS have been rated number one in the daypart by Nielsen Media Research for 12 consecutive years.     In 1997, the Company acquired a 50% interest in the UNITED PARAMOUNT NETWORK(R) ("UPN") from BHC Communications, Inc. ("BHC"), a subsidiary of Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. In March 2000, BHC sold to the Company the remaining 50% interest in UPN for $5 million. After the May 2000 merger with CBS, pursuant to which the Company acquired the CBS TELEVISION NETWORK, the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC" or the "Commission") ordered the Company to come into compliance with its rule prohibiting a single entity from operating two networks within 12 months of the merger closing date. The FCC subsequently proposed to eliminate this rule. (See "Viacom Segments-- Regulation--Broadcasting").     At December 31, 2000, UPN provided 23 hours of programming a week, including two-hour prime-time programming blocks five nights per week, to affiliates in 177 U.S. television markets, reaching approximately 96% of all U.S. television households, including secondary affiliates. Nineteen of the Company's owned television stations and two stations which the Company programs pursuant to local marketing agreements ("LMAs") are affiliates of UPN.     Television Stations. The Company owns 39 television stations, all of which operate under licenses granted by the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act"). The licenses are renewable every eight years. In addition to these 39 owned stations, the Company operates two additional commercial television stations--(WTVX-TV in West Palm Beach--Ft. Pierce, FL and WLWC-TV in Providence, RI--New Bedford, MA), pursuant to LMAs.     The Company's television stations are located in the 12 largest, and 18 of the top 20, television markets in the United States. Consistent with the 1999 liberalization of the FCC's local ownership rules, the Company has duopolies in 6 major markets: Philadelphia (market #4), Boston (market #6), Dallas (market #7), Detroit (market #9), Miami (market #16) and Pittsburgh (market #20). The 39 owned stations reach approximately 48% of all U.S. television households, which equals approximately 41% of U.S. television households under the FCC                                        I-8 national ownership limitation. The FCC's order approving the merger of Viacom and CBS requires that the Company be in compliance with the FCC's national ownership limitation of 35% by May 4, 2001. The Company has challenged the rule in federal court and is seeking a stay of the requirement to come into compliance with the limit pending judicial review of the national ownership cap (See "Viacom Segments--Regulation--Broadcasting").     The stations produce news and broadcast public affairs and other programming to serve their local markets and offer CBS or UPN television network and syndicated programming. Many of the Company's television stations currently operate Web sites which promote the stations' talent and programming, and provide news, information and entertainment, as well as other services.     Currently, broadcast signals are, for the most part, transmitted in analog form. However, in April 1997, the FCC assigned each existing television station a six MHz channel to be used for the broadcast of digital television. The FCC adopted a time schedule under which stations are required (absent conditions beyond their control) to construct digital transmission facilities and begin digital operations. The schedule has staggered deadlines depending upon a station's market size and whether the station is affiliated with a major broadcast television network (CBS, ABC, NBC, or FOX). Under the schedule, the Company was required to construct digital transmission facilities for its eight CBS network affiliated stations in the top ten markets by May 1, 1999, and by November 1, 1999, for its seven CBS network affiliated stations in the 11th through 30th markets. The Company is required to construct digital facilities for the five CBS network affiliated stations in markets below the top 30, as well as for its UPN network affiliated stations in all markets, by May 1, 2002. The Company is currently transmitting digital broadcasts for CBS network affiliated owned and operated stations in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas (low power), Detroit, Pittsburgh and Baltimore. The Company is currently transmitting digital broadcasts for UPN network affiliated owned and operated stations in Dallas and Detroit.

The Company, through CBS ENTERPRISES (including KING WORLD PRODUCTIONS and CBS BROADCAST INTERNATIONAL), PARAMOUNT TELEVISION, SPELLING TELEVISION(R) (including BIG TICKET TELEVISION(R)) and VIACOM PRODUCTIONS acquires or produces, and distributes programming worldwide including series, miniseries, specials and made-for-television movies primarily for broadcast on network television, and first-run and off-network syndicated programming.     The Company's current network programming includes ED (NBC); FRASIER (NBC); BECKER (CBS); DIAGNOSIS MURDER (CBS); JAG (CBS); SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS (CBS); SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH (WB); MOESHA (UPN); SEVEN DAYS (UPN); THE PARKERS (UPN); STAR TREK: VOYAGER (UPN); CHARMED (WB); 7TH HEAVEN (WB); THAT'S LIFE (CBS); and GIRLFRIENDS (UPN). Generally, a network will license a specified number of episodes for exhibition on the network in the U.S. during a license period. The bulk of remaining distribution rights, including foreign and off-network syndication rights, are typically retained by the Company. The episodic network license fee is normally less than the costs of producing each series episode; however, in many cases, the Company has been successful in recouping a portion of its costs through domestic syndication of episodes after their network runs or by obtaining international sales through its licensing operations. Foreign sales are generally concurrent with U.S. network runs. Generally, a series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic syndication.     In off-network syndication, the Company distributes such series as CAROLINE IN THE CITY; EARLY EDITION; FRASIER; MOESHA; SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH; 7TH HEAVEN; SISTER, SISTER; SPIN CITY; STAR TREK: VOYAGER and TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL. Outside the U.S., PARAMOUNT PICTURES INTERNATIONAL, WVI FILMS B.V. and CBS BROADCAST INTERNATIONAL distribute U.S. network series programming.     The Company produces and/or distributes programming for first-run syndication which it sells directly to television stations in the U.S. on a market-by-market basis. The Company's first-run syndicated programming includes such shows as ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT, ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT WEEKEND, HOLLYWOOD SQUARES, INSIDE EDITION, JEOPARDY!, JUDGE JOE BROWN, JUDGE JUDY, JUDGE MILLS LANE, MARTHA STEWART LIVING, MAXIMUM EXPOSURE, THE MONTEL WILLIAMS SHOW, THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW, QUEEN OF SWORDS, REAL TV, RELIC HUNTER and WHEEL OF FORTUNE.     The Company produces and/or distributes original television programming to basic cable program services (such as the television series ANY DAY NOW, BEYOND CHANCE and THE DIVISION, on Lifetime), including services in which the Company has an interest, such as NICK AT NITE, TV LAND and VH1 in the U.S. and PARAMOUNT COMEDY CHANNEL in U.K. and Spain. It also produces and/or distributes for premium subscription services programming such as SOUL FOOD, RESURRECTION BLVD. and THE CHRIS ISAAK SHOW. The Company also co-produces and/or distributes original television programming for foreign television exhibition, including such shows as HOPE ISLAND, HIGHER GROUND, LARGO WINCH and TRIBE.     The recognition of revenues for license fees for completed television programming in syndication and on basic cable is similar to that of feature films exhibited on television with license fees recorded as revenue in the year that programming is available for exhibition which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in the Televsion segment's operating results. At December 31, 2000, the unrecognized revenues attributable to television program license agreements were approximately $622 million, compared to approximately $462 million at December 31, 1999.   Infinity     Infinity's operations are focused on the out-of-home media business with operations in radio broadcasting through INFINITY BROADCASTING, and outdoor advertising through INFINITY OUTDOOR and TDI. The                                       I-12 Radio Stations and Outdoor Displays table sets forth selected information with regard to Infinity's radio stations and outdoor displays in the top 25 U.S. radio markets. Infinity characterizes its radio and outdoor advertising businesses as out-of-home because a majority of radio listening, and virtually all viewing of outdoor advertising, takes place in automobiles, transit systems, on the street and other locations outside the consumer's home. Infinity's strategy generally is to acquire out-of-home media properties in the largest markets.     Infinity Radio. INFINITY BROADCASTING, consisting of 184 radio stations serving 41 markets, accounted for approximately 13% of total 2000 U.S. radio advertising expenditures. The Company's stations ranked first or second, in terms of 2000 pro forma radio revenues, in 30 out of the 41 markets in which the Company operates stations. Approximately 91% of the Company's radio stations are located in the 50 largest radio markets in the United States, and 62% and 97% of the Company's pro forma 2000 net radio revenues were generated in the 10 and 50 largest U.S. markets, respectively. The Company believes that this focus on large markets makes it more appealing to advertisers, enables it to attract more highly skilled management, employees and on-air talent, and enables it to more efficiently manage its business and generate higher levels of cash flow than would be the case if it managed a larger number of smaller stations. Infinity owns the CBS RADIO NETWORK, which is managed by Westwood One, Inc.     Infinity's radio stations serve diverse target demographics through a broad range of programming formats. This diversity provides advertisers with the convenience to select stations to reach a targeted demographic group or to select groups of stations and outdoor advertising properties to reach broad groups of consumers within and across markets. This diversity also reduces its dependence on any single station, local economy, format or advertiser.     Infinity seeks to maintain substantial diversity among its radio stations in many respects. The geographically wide-ranging stations serve diverse target demographics through a broad range of programming formats, such as rock, oldies, news/talk, adult contemporary, sports/talk and country, and Infinity has established leading franchises in news, sports, and personality programming. The overall mix of each radio station's programming is designed to fit the station's specific format and serve its local community. Infinity's general programming strategy includes acquiring significant on-air talent and the rights to broadcast sports franchises and news content for its radio stations. This strategy, in addition to developing loyal audiences for its radio stations, creates the opportunity to obtain additional revenues from syndicating such programming franchises to other radio stations.     Outdoor Advertising. INFINITY OUTDOOR and TDI sell advertising space on various media, including billboards, bulletins, buses, bus shelters and benches, trains, train platforms and terminals throughout commuter rail systems, mall posters and phone kiosks. Infinity has outdoor advertising operations in more than 90 markets in North America, and all 50 of the largest metropolitan markets in the United States, 14 of the 15 largest metropolitan markets in Canada and all of the 45 largest metropolitan markets in Mexico. Additionally, the Company has the exclusive rights to manage advertising space within the London Underground and on more than 90% of the buses in London and the United Kingdom, has the exclusive rights to transit advertising in the Republic of Ireland and parts of Northern Ireland, and has a variety of outdoor advertising displays in the Netherlands, France, Italy, Spain and Finland.     The substantial majority of Infinity's revenues are generated from the sale of local, regional and national advertising. The major categories of out-of- home advertisers include: automotive, retail, healthcare, telecommunications, fast food, beverage, movies, entertainment and services.     Infinity beneficially owns shares and vested warrants representing approximately 18% of the common stock of Westwood One, Inc., which it manages pursuant to a management agreement. Westwood One is one of the leading producers and distributors of syndicated and network radio programming in the U.S. and distributes syndicated and network radio programming to the Company's radio stations as well as to competitors of Infinity.     Seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the out-of-home media industry and are primarily the result of fluctuations in advertising expenditures by retailers. Infinity's revenues are typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter.

PARAMOUNT PARKS, which operates five regional theme parks and a themed attraction in the U.S. and Canada; FAMOUS PLAYERS(R), which operates movie theaters; and FAMOUS MUSIC(R).     Theatrical Motion Pictures. Through PARAMOUNT PICTURES, the Company produces, finances and distributes feature motion pictures. Motion pictures are produced by PARAMOUNT PICTURES, produced by independent producers and financed in whole or in part by PARAMOUNT PICTURES, or produced by others and distributed by PARAMOUNT PICTURES. Each picture is a separate and distinct product with its financial success dependent upon many factors, among which cost and public response are of fundamental importance. In general, motion pictures produced or acquired for distribution by PARAMOUNT PICTURES are exhibited in U.S. and foreign theaters followed by videocassettes, discs and DVDs, pay-per-view television, premium subscription television, network television, basic cable television and syndicated television exploitation. During 2000, PARAMOUNT PICTURES produced or co-produced and theatrically released 12 feature motion pictures in the U.S., including WONDER BOYS, RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2, SHAFT and WHAT WOMEN WANT; THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY produced by MTV FILMS in association with PARAMOUNT PICTURES; and SNOW DAY and RUGRATS IN PARIS: THE MOVIE produced by NICKELODEON MOVIES in association with PARAMOUNT PICTURES. PARAMOUNT PICTURES currently plans to release approximately 17 films in 2001 (which release plans may change due to a variety of factors), including DOWN TO EARTH, ENEMY AT THE GATES, ALONG CAME A SPIDER, TOMB RAIDER, RAT RACE, DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE, FOUR FEATHERS, and VANILLA SKY, and ZOOLANDER produced by VH1 FILMS(TM) in association with PARAMOUNT PICTURES, SAVE THE LAST DANCE and ORANGE COUNTY produced by MTV FILMS in association with PARAMOUNT PICTURES, and JIMMY NEUTRON-BOY GENIUS produced by NICKELODEON MOVIES in association with PARAMOUNT PICTURES.     PARAMOUNT CLASSICS(TM), a division of PARAMOUNT PICTURES, released seven films in 2000, including SUNSHINE, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, YOU CAN COUNT ON ME and THE GIFT. PARAMOUNT CLASSICS was established to handle the distribution of specialized film product that may require alternative release strategies from films generally distributed by PARAMOUNT PICTURES. PARAMOUNT CLASSICS currently plans to release approximately six titles in 2001 (which release plans may change due to a variety of factors).     In seeking to limit PARAMOUNT PICTURES' financial exposure, the Company has pursued a strategy with respect to a number of films of entering into agreements to distribute such films produced and/or financed, in whole or in part, with other parties. The parties to these arrangements include studio and non-studio entities, both domestic and foreign. In various of these arrangements, the other parties control certain distribution and other ownership rights.     PARAMOUNT PICTURES generally distributes its motion pictures for theatrical release outside the U.S. and Canada through United International Pictures ("UIP"), a company owned by the Company and an affiliate of Universal Studios, Inc. ("Universal"). Pursuant to an agreement, UIP will continue to distribute each studio's films through 2006. PARAMOUNT PICTURES distributes its motion pictures on videocassette and disc in the U.S. and Canada through PARAMOUNT HOME ENTERTAINMENT(TM) and outside the U.S. and Canada, generally through PARAMOUNT HOME ENTERTAINMENT INTERNATIONAL. Commencing April 2000, PARAMOUNT HOME ENTERTAINMENT INTERNATIONAL started releasing pictures in DVD format in Europe and Japan. PARAMOUNT PICTURES' feature films initially theatrically released in the U.S. on or after January 1, 1998 are exhibited exclusively (to U.S. premium subscription television) on SHOWTIME and THE MOVIE CHANNEL. PARAMOUNT PICTURES also distributes its motion pictures for premium subscription, free and basic cable television release outside the U.S. and Canada and licenses its motion pictures to residential and hotel/motel pay- per-view, airlines, schools and universities.                                       I-16 During 2000, PARAMOUNT PICTURES INTERNATIONAL entered into an agreement with DBS Satellite Services for pay television distribution rights in Israel for current films, library films and television products and PARAMOUNT PICTURES INTERNATIONAL and WVI FILMS B.V. entered into an agreement with Movie Television Inc. for free television distribution rights in Japan for current motion picture and television product. This latter agreement also includes free television distribution rights in Japan for various motion picture and television library product.     In addition to premium subscription television, most motion pictures are also licensed for exhibition on broadcast and basic cable television, with fees generally collected in installments. All of the above license fees for television exhibition (including international and U.S. premium television and basic cable television) are recorded as revenue in the year that licensed films are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in PARAMOUNT PICTURES' operating results. At December 31, 2000, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing of completed films from PARAMOUNT PICTURES' license agreements were approximately $1.0 billion, compared to approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 1999. At December 31, 2000, PARAMOUNT PICTURES had approximately 1,000 motion pictures in its library. The Company also has a library of additional motion picture titles, most of which comprise the SPELLING ENTERTAINMENT(TM) library.     Through PARAMOUNT PICTURES and various of its affiliates, the Company is a joint venturer in a number of international program services, including THE PARAMOUNT COMEDY CHANNEL(TM) in the U.K., an afternoon and nighttime (including prime time) program service featuring comedies and films, which is a joint venture with BSkyB. On March 1, 1999, the Company launched THE PARAMOUNT COMEDY CHANNEL(R) in Spain, a wholly owned, 24-hour program service, including a NICKELODEON program segment.     Theatrical Exhibition. The Company's movie theater operations consist primarily of FAMOUS PLAYERS in Canada and United Cinemas International ("UCI") in Europe, Latin America and Asia. At December 31, 2000, FAMOUS PLAYERS, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, operated approximately 880 screens in 104 theaters across Canada. UCI, a 50%-owned joint venture of entities affiliated with the Company and Universal, operated as of December 31, 2000, approximately 970 screens in 113 theaters in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Austria, Spain, Japan, Italy, Poland, Argentina, Brazil, Panama and Taiwan.     As of November 29, 1999, WF Cinema Holdings, L.P. (a limited partnership in which the Company owns a 50% interest and the other 50% is controlled by AOL Time Warner Inc., "WF Cinema") entered into agreements (the "Asset Agreements") with WestStar Cinemas, Inc., WestStar Real Estate, Inc., Colorado Holdings LLC and WestStar Holdings, Inc. (collectively, "WestStar"), which parties are the subject of a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code proceeding. Pursuant to the Asset Agreements, WF Cinema agreed to purchase from WestStar various theaters and related assets for a purchase price of $90 million (which was paid during 2000) and other consideration. The theaters and assets which are the subject of this transaction comprise in large part the assets that were sold by WF Cinema (then known as Cinamerica Theaters L.P.) to WestStar in 1997. WF Cinema has disposed of or closed a number of the theaters that were acquired and currently intends to dispose of or close some of the remaining theaters. The Company and AOL Time Warner have agreed to guarantee certain obligations of WF Cinema as part of these transactions. The Asset Agreements were approved by the Bankruptcy Court on January 12, 2000, and the acquisition by WF Cinema closed on January 28, 2000.     Music Publishing. The FAMOUS MUSIC publishing companies own, control and/or administer all or a portion of the copyright rights to more than 100,000 musical works (songs, scores, cues). These rights include the right to license and exploit such works, as well as the right to collect income generated by such licensing and exploitation.     The majority of rights acquired by FAMOUS MUSIC are derived from (i) music acquisition agreements entered into by PARAMOUNT PICTURES, PARAMOUNT TELEVISION, SPELLING TELEVISION, MTVN and various other divisions of the Company respecting certain motion pictures, television programs and other properties produced by such units and (ii) music acquisition agreements entered into directly by FAMOUS MUSIC with songwriters and music publishers, including exclusive songwriting agreements, catalog purchases and music administration agreements.                                       I-17 Parks. PARAMOUNT PARKS owns and operates five regional theme parks and a themed attraction in the U.S. and Canada: PARAMOUNT'S CAROWINDS(R), in Charlotte, North Carolina; PARAMOUNT'S GREAT AMERICA(TM), in Santa Clara, California; PARAMOUNT'S KINGS DOMINION(TM), located near Richmond, Virginia; PARAMOUNT'S KINGS ISLAND(TM), located near Cincinnati, Ohio; PARAMOUNT CANADA'S WONDERLAND(R), located near Toronto, Ontario; and STAR TREK: THE EXPERIENCE(R), at the Las Vegas Hilton, a futuristic, interactive environment based on the popular television and movie series. Each of the theme parks features attractions, products and live shows based on various intellectual properties of the Company.     A substantial amount of the theme parks' income is generated during its seasonal operating period. Factors such as local economic conditions, competitors and their marketing/pricing actions, and extreme weather conditions could negatively impact the business' overall profitability if they come into play during the operating season.   Video     The Company operates in the home video business through its approximately 82% equity interest in Blockbuster Inc. As of December 31, 2000, the Company's video segment, which included BLOCKBUSTER's home video, DVD and video game rental and retailing operations operated or franchised approximately 7,700 stores in the U.S., its territories and 25 other countries. BLOCKBUSTER also operates its Internet site, "blockbuster.com" and is exploring various forms of electronic entertainment delivery including video-on-demand.     In its stores, which operate primarily under the highly recognized BLOCKBUSTER brand name, BLOCKBUSTER offers video movies and video games primarily for rental and also offers certain titles for purchase. BLOCKBUSTER also offers DVDs for rental and for sale in most of its U.S. stores. In addition, BLOCKBUSTER offers previously-viewed tapes and previously-viewed video games for sale. During 2000, BLOCKBUSTER expanded its traditional video rental service through an agreement with DIRECTV, Inc. ("DIRECTV"), a provider of digital television entertainment service. Pursuant to this agreement, BLOCKBUSTER is now marketing DIRECTV System equipment and DIRECTV(R) programming packages in over 3,800 of BLOCKBUSTER's U.S. stores. Blockbuster and DIRECTV have also announced that they plan to introduce a co-branded pay- per-view service during 2001. BLOCKBUSTER also launched a movies-on-demand service on a trial basis in four cities in December 2000. In addition, in February 2001, BLOCKBUSTER entered into a strategic alliance with RadioShack Corporation for the purpose of introducing a RadioShack store-within-a-store concept inside BLOCKBUSTER.     BLOCKBUSTER acquires its VHS movies primarily pursuant to revenue-sharing arrangements that were initially implemented in 1998 with the major motion picture studios, including PARAMOUNT PICTURES. BLOCKBUSTER entered into these arrangements in order to increase the quantity and selection of newly released video titles and to satisfy its customers' demand for newly released videos earlier. For titles acquired under these arrangements, revenue-sharing generally allows BLOCKBUSTER to license videocassettes for minimal up-front payments with a percentage of the U.S. rental revenues shared with the studios over a contractually determined period of time. In addition to acquiring products pursuant to revenue-sharing agreements, BLOCKBUSTER purchases certain products that are not subject to revenue-sharing agreements, at wholesale prices. BLOCKBUSTER also purchases "sell-through" titles, which are movies that are released by the studios at relatively low initial prices in order to generate consumer demand to purchase, rather than rent, them. Almost all DVDs are also released by the studios at sell-through prices. In addition, BLOCKBUSTER also acquires and offers a wide variety of independent and lower- cost movies that are generally exclusively available for a specified period of time at its stores. BLOCKBUSTER also rents video game consoles and DVD players in most of its U.S. stores.     As with other retail outlets, there is a distinct seasonal pattern to the home video and video games business, with particularly weaker business in April and May, due in part to improved weather and Daylight Savings Time, and in September and October, due in part to the start of school and the introduction of new television programs.

The consumer publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand in the summer months and during the end-of-year holiday season. Major new title releases drive a significant portion of SIMON & SCHUSTER's sales throughout the year.     Consumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in significant product returns. In the international markets, the Company is subject to global trends and local economic conditions.   Online     Through its 90% equity interest in THE MTVi GROUP, L.P. ("MTVi") and through NICKELODEON ONLINE(TM), the Company operates Internet sites which are targeted to the current audiences of its various MTV, VH1 and NICKELODEON television program services worldwide, as well as to new online audiences. The remaining 10% interest in MTVi is owned by Liberty Digital, Inc. In addition to providing entertainment and information on such Web sites, the Company also sells Company-licensed and third-party merchandise.                                       I-19 MTVi has numerous music Web site destinations around the world, including MTV.com, VH1.com, Country.com and SonicNet.com. In December 2000, MTVi's Web sites attracted over 4 million unique visitors, according to Media Metrix, a leading online audience research measurement service. MTV.com offers users the latest music news, information on artists and MTV programs, and interactive entertainment through convergence programs such as Direct Effect (DFX), Total Request Live (TRL) and VJ for a Day. VH1.com offers users convergent entertainment, music news, fan club information, daily polls and community features.     MTVi currently obtains much of its content from record labels, music publishers and artists. While MTVi obtains certain rights to some of such content (such as performance rights of song composers and non-interactive rights to digital transmission of recordings) pursuant to statutory compulsory licenses, the royalties payable for such compulsory licenses are not yet established or have not yet been negotiated. Other rights are not subject to compulsory licenses and must be negotiated with the individual record labels and other providers. If these providers begin to charge significant fees for their content, or otherwise alter or discontinue their relationship with MTVi, then MTVi's content offering and business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because the laws relating to online rights for music and other copyrighted works are evolving, it is possible that parties from whom MTVi currently does not obtain licenses will demand that MTVi obtain them and pay certain fees for usage (see "Viacom Segments--Regulation--Intellectual Property").     NICKELODEON ONLINE operates Web sites that feature NICKELODEON properties, including Nick.com, NickJR.com, TVLand.com, Nick-at-Nite.com, Gas.Nick.com and Teachers.Nick.com. Nick.com is a leading Web site for kids, offering convergent entertainment, online games, entertainment tools and services, Internet radio, information on Nickelodeon celebrities and programs and other content for kids. NickJR.com offers online content for parents and their pre- school aged kids, including advice, parent-to-parent communities, e-commerce, as well as a preschool area featuring interactive games, art, stories and music. In December 2000, NICKELODEON ONLINE's Web sites attracted over 2.8 million unique visitors, according to Media Metrix.     In addition, the Company operates two Web sites, CBS.com and CBSNews.com, which draw visitors from CBS TELEVISION NETWORK programming in all dayparts (daytime, primetime and late night). CBS.com integrates local, national and international news, weather, sports and information on CBS TELEVISION NETWORK programming in one location. The site provides information on CBS ENTERTAINMENT programming (including such features as David Letterman's "Top Ten" list). In early 2001, as a result of the debut of CBS's reality show, SURVIVOR: THE AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK, CBS.com reached its highest visitor levels ever. The site also provides links to a number of sites in which the Company owns an equity interest, including CBS MarketWatch, CBS SportsLine and CBS HealthWatch.     CBSNews.com brings the coverage and reputation of CBS NEWS to the Internet, including multimedia coverage of top stories, coverage of breaking news events and information from CBS NEWS investigations.     During 2000, the Online segment included an investment in iWon, Inc., which operates an Internet portal. Subsequent to December 31, 2000, the successor to iWon will be included with the Company's other Internet investments. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company will present its online businesses as part of the Cable Networks and Television segments. Online revenues are primarily generated by advertising revenues derived from online advertising and on-air promotion and by the sale of merchandise.     The Company also operates Internet sites through its other businesses, such as PARAMOUNT PICTURES, INFINITY BROADCASTING, BLOCKBUSTER, SHOWTIME and SIMON & SCHUSTER, for the purpose of marketing and commerce. Such activity is not reported as part of the Online segment.     Internet Investments: The Company holds minority investments in five public Internet companies: Sportsline.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPLN), which publishes several sports Internet sites including CBS.sportsline.com; MarketWatch.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: MKTW), which publishes financial and market data Internet sites including CBS.marketwatch.com; Hollywood Media Corp. (NASDAQ: HOLL), which publishes entertainment content Internet sites, including hollywood.com; Switchboard Incorporated (NASDAQ: SWBD),                                       I-20 which publishes local information directory Internet sites, including switchboard.com; and Medicalogic/Medscape, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDLI), which publishes consumer health Internet sites including CBShealthwatch.medscape.com. Other Internet investments of the Company include minority investments in Office.com, Inc., Content Commerce, L.P., RX.com, Inc. and Wrenchead.com, Inc.  Competition     Corporate mergers consummated in recent years have resulted in greater consolidation in the entertainment industries, which may also present significant competitive challenges to several of the Company's businesses.   Cable Networks     MTV Networks. MTVN services compete with other basic cable program services for channel space and compensation for carriage from cable television operators, DTH and other multichannel distributors. MTVN also competes for advertising revenue with other basic cable and broadcast television networks, and radio and print media. For basic cable television networks such as the MTVN services, advertising revenues derived by each program service depend on the number of households subscribing to the service through local cable operators and other distributors in addition to household and demographic viewership as determined by research companies such as Nielsen Media Research. MTVN services also compete with other cable services and broadcast television for the acquisition of popular programming.     Certain major record companies have launched music-based program services outside the U.S., including, but not limited to: Channel V, which is jointly owned and operated in Asia and Australia by Star TV and four major record labels; and Viva and Viva 2, German-language music channels distributed in Germany and owned in large part by four major record labels. In addition to the competition referred to above, MTVN's music-based program services compete with other music-based television program services and blocks for distribution by cable, satellite and other systems, and for distribution license fees and advertising revenues.     Children-oriented programming blocks are currently exhibited on a number of U.S. broadcast television networks, including, among others, "Fox Kids," "Kids' WB" and a Saturday morning block on ABC, all of which compete with NICKELODEON for advertising revenue. There are also a number of other U.S. cable television program services featuring children-oriented programming, including the Cartoon Network, the Disney Channel and the Fox Family Channel. In addition to the competition referred to above, NICKELODEON competes internationally with other television program services and blocks targeted at children for distribution by cable, satellite and other systems, and for distribution license fees and advertising revenue.     Showtime Networks Inc. Competition among premium subscription television program services in the U.S. is primarily dependent on: (i) the acquisition and packaging of an adequate number of recently released quality motion pictures and the production, acquisition and packaging of original motion pictures, original series and other original programs; and (ii) the offering of prices, marketing and advertising support and other incentives to cable operators and other distributors for carriage so as to favorably position and package SNI's premium subscription television program services to subscribers. HBO is the dominant company in the U.S. premium subscription television category, offering two premium subscription television program services, the HBO service and Cinemax. SNI is second to HBO with a significantly smaller share of the premium subscription television category. Starz Encore Media Group (an affiliate of AT&T Corp.) owns the third principal premium subscription television program service in the U.S., Starz!, which features recently released motion pictures and competes with SNI's and HBO's premium program services.  Television     The television broadcast environment is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in broadcast television are the acquisition of popular programming and the development of audience interest                                       I-21 through programming and promotions in order to sell advertising at profitable rates. Broadcast networks like CBS and UPN compete for audience, advertising revenues and programming with other broadcast networks, independent television stations, basic cable program services as well as other media, including satellite television services, videocassettes, DVDs and the Internet. Television stations compete for programming and for advertising revenues with other stations in their respective coverage areas and, in some cases, with larger station groups for programming, and in the case of advertising revenues, with other local media. In addition, the CBS and UPN television networks compete with other television networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations in markets across the country, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a nationwide audience.     Because an extended conversion to digital television broadcasting has begun current and future technological developments may affect competition within the television marketplace. Technological developments that compress digital signals will increasingly permit the same broadcast, cable, or satellite channel to carry multiple video and data services which could result in an expanded field of competing services. Television broadcasters will continue to operate their current stations while gradually building and operating digital facilities concurrently on separate channels.     As a producer and distributor of programming, the Company competes with studios, television networks and independent producers and syndicators to sell programming both domestically and overseas.   Infinity     The Company's radio stations and outdoor advertising properties compete for audience, advertising revenues and programming directly with other radio stations and outdoor advertising companies, as well as with other media, such as broadcast television, newspapers, magazines, cable television, the Internet and direct mail, within their respective markets.     The radio and outdoor advertising industry is also subject to competition from new media technologies that are being developed or introduced, such as the delivery of audio programming by cable television systems, by satellite and by terrestrial delivery of digital audio broadcasting. The FCC has authorized spectrum for the use of a new technology, satellite digital audio radio services, to deliver audio programming. Satellite digital audio radio service will provide a medium for the delivery by satellite of multiple new audio programming formats to local and national audiences. The FCC also has a pending proceeding which contemplates the use of digital technology by existing terrestrial radio broadcast stations either on existing or alternate broadcasting frequencies. The FCC recently authorized a new "low power" radio or "microbroadcasting" service with the intent of creating opportunities for low cost neighborhood service on frequencies which would not interfere with existing stations.   Entertainment     Theatrical Motion Pictures. The Company competes with other major studios and independent film producers in the production and distribution of motion pictures, videocassettes, discs and DVDs. PARAMOUNT PICTURES' competitive position primarily depends on the quality of the product produced, its distribution and marketing success, and public response. The Company also competes to obtain creative talent and story properties which are essential to the success of all of the Company's entertainment businesses.     Parks. During the last two years, the regional theme park industry has experienced increased consolidation. The Company must now compete in a business environment that is dominated by highly-capitalized, multi-park entertainment corporations. In order to compete effectively, regional theme park operators must differentiate their product by having access to the latest entertainment intellectual property and brands and must reinvest capital to maintain a fresh experience for their repeat-visitor base. The Company believes that its intellectual properties enhance existing attractions and facilitate the development of new attractions, which encourage visitors to the PARAMOUNT PARKS theme parks and STAR TREK: THE EXPERIENCE at the Las Vegas Hilton. The Company's theme parks also compete with other forms of leisure entertainment.                                       I-22 Video     BLOCKBUSTER operates in a highly competitive environment. The Company believes that BLOCKBUSTER's most significant competition comes from (i) video stores and other retailers that rent or sell movies and (ii) providers of direct delivery home viewing entertainment.     Video stores and other retailers that rent or sell movies include, among others, (i) local, regional and national video stores; (ii) mass merchant retailers; (iii) supermarkets, pharmacies and convenience stores; and (iv) online retailers and mail order services. The Company believes that the principal factors that BLOCKBUSTER faces in competing with video stores and other retailers are (a) convenience and visibility of store locations; (b) quality, quantity and variety of titles; (c) pricing; and (d) customer service.     With the development of new technologies, a significant competitive risk to BLOCKBUSTER's video store business comes from direct broadcast satellite, digital cable television and high-speed Internet access. In response to this competition in 2000, BLOCKBUSTER entered the direct broadcast satellite market through its alliance with DIRECTV (see "Viacom Segments--Video"). Direct broadcast satellite, digital cable and "traditional" cable providers not only offer numerous channels of conventional television, but they also offer pay- per-view movies which permit a subscriber to pay a fee to see a selected movie. Because of the increased availability of channels, direct broadcast satellite and digital cable providers have been able to enhance their pay-per- view business by (i) substantially increasing the number and variety of movies they can offer their subscribers on a pay-per-view basis; and (ii) providing more frequent and convenient start times for the most popular movies. Pay-per- view allows the consumer to avoid trips to the video store for rentals and returns of movies, which also eliminates the chance they will incur additional costs for keeping a movie beyond its initial rental term. However, newly released movies are currently made available by the studios for rental prior to being made available for pay-per-view. Pay-per-view also does not allow the consumer to start, stop and rewind the movie or fully control start times. As a result, some digital cable providers and a limited number of Internet content providers have begun implementing technology referred to as "video-on- demand," which technology transmits movies on demand with interactive capabilities such as start, stop and rewind. BLOCKBUSTER also began testing a video-on-demand service in 2000 with its initial movies-on-demand trials. In addition to competing with the video retail industry, video-on-demand competes with other uses of cable and telephony infrastructure, such as the ability to provide Internet access and basic telephone services, some of which may provide higher returns for operators. In addition, video-on-demand providers, including BLOCKBUSTER, may face competition from the studios, which are considering implementing their own video-on-demand service.  Publishing     The consumer publishing business is highly competitive and has been affected by consolidation trends. Recent years have brought a number of significant mergers among the leading consumer publishers. The book superstore has emerged as a significant factor in the industry contributing to the general trend toward consolidation in the retail channel. There have also been a number of mergers completed in the distribution channel.     The Company must compete with other publishers for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities.  Online     The online industry is highly competitive and is rapidly evolving and facing changing market conditions, including consolidation, alterations in online advertising spending, slower growth in e-commerce and greater difficulties in accessing public and private financing. Competition among media and Internet companies pursuing online consumers is particularly intense. The Company's online businesses compete for online consumers, advertisers and content providers with leading news/information/entertainment online sites, online portal services and broadcasters, traditional media, retail and record companies and their respective Internet properties, and                                       I-23 online commerce companies. Rivalry for online consumers' attention and leisure time, and associated advertising dollars and e-commerce expenditures by online consumers, will continue to increase for all industry participants.     Web sites maintained by existing and potential competitors may be perceived by online consumers, advertisers and content and other online vendors to be superior to the Company's Web sites. In addition, with respect to MTVi's Web sites, the major record companies, which control the vast majority of recorded music, have started to engage in strategic arrangements, including business combinations, with Internet and Internet-related businesses for the online distribution and other commercialization of their music libraries and artist relationships. As a result of these actions, the Company's online businesses may not be able to maintain or increase online traffic levels on its Web sites, which may negatively affect their advertising and e-commerce revenues.  Regulation     The Company's businesses are either subject to or affected by regulations of federal, state and local governmental authorities. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting these businesses are constantly subject to change. The descriptions which follow are summaries and should be read in conjunction with the texts of the statutes, rules and regulations described herein. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed statutes, rules and regulations affecting the Company's businesses.   Intellectual Property     Domestic and international laws affecting intellectual property are of significant importance to the Company.     WIPO Copyright Treaties. In 1996, delegates to the World Intellectual Property Organization ("WIPO") adopted a proposed Copyright Treaty which will take effect if ratified by 30 nations. As of December 2000, 22 countries, including the U.S., had ratified the Copyright Treaty.     The proposed Copyright Treaty updates the Berne Convention, last revised in 1971, and addresses copyright protection for new technologies that have emerged since that time. It is not possible to predict whether the Copyright Treaty will take effect or how countries would implement the Treaty after ratification. Because the Treaty includes important copyright protections for the digital transmission of content, if ratified, the Treaty likely would have a positive impact on the Company.     The U.S. implementing legislation, known as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which is effective whether or not WIPO is ultimately ratified, affords important new copyright protections, including civil and criminal penalties for the manufacture of, or trafficking in, devices that circumvent copyright protection technologies such as encryption and scrambling, and for the act of circumventing such technologies to gain unauthorized access to a copyrighted work. The DMCA also amends the Copyright Act by creating a new statutory license concerning certain rights related to digital transmissions of sound recordings. The statute provides that new statutory rates for each license will be set either through voluntary negotiations between the interested parties or through Copyright Arbitration Royalty Proceedings.     Copyright Term Extension. In October 1998, Congress passed legislation extending the copyright term an additional twenty years. The extended term is life of the author plus 70 years for authored works and 95 years for works- made-for-hire. This extension puts the U.S. copyright term on par with the European Community. Term extension should have a beneficial effect for the Company over time, including with respect to important publishing properties which otherwise would have passed into the public domain in the next several years.     Compulsory Copyright License.       Multichannel Distributors Other Than DTH. The Copyright Act provides a      ----------------------------------------   compulsory license for the retransmission of broadcast signals by   multichannel video distributors such as cable television, MMDS (Multipoint   Multichannel Distribution Systems) and SMATV (Satellite Master Antenna   Television)                                       I-24 operators. The compulsory license rate paid to programmers for the   retransmission of distant broadcast signals by cable, MMDS and SMATV   operators is established by statute. There is no licensing fee for the   retransmission of local broadcast signals.       DTH. In November 1999, Congress enacted legislation to extend and reform      ---   the Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA). The original SHVA legislation created   a temporary compulsory license that allowed satellite carriers to import   distant broadcast signals to those homes that were unable to receive their   local broadcast signals. This distant signal compulsory license was set to   expire at the end of 1999. Through the SHVA legislation, Congress extended   the distant signal compulsory license until December 31, 2004, and set a   statutory compulsory license fee for these distant signals of $0.189 per   subscriber for superstations and $0.1485 per subscriber for networks. Up to   this point, the DTH compulsory license fee was set through negotiations and   binding arbitration. In addition, Congress created a new and permanent   compulsory license for the retransmission of local broadcast signals back   into the local market, the so-called "local-into-local" provision. Unlike   the distant signal compulsory license, the local signal compulsory license   is royalty-free.     First Sale Doctrine. The copyright "First Sale" doctrine provides that the owner of a legitimate copy of a copyrighted work may use or dispose of it in such manner as the owner sees fit, including by renting it. The First Sale doctrine does not apply to sound recordings or computer software (other than software made for a limited purpose computer, such as a video game platform) for which the Copyright Act vests a rental right (i.e., the right to control the rental of the copy) in the copyright holder. The repeal or limitation of the First Sale doctrine (or conversely, the creation of a rental right vested in the copyright holder) for audiovisual works or for computer software made for limited purpose computers would have an adverse impact on the Company's home video and game rental business. No such legislation is pending in Congress at the present time. However, the Copyright Office is currently conducting a study of the First Sale doctrine and it is unclear whether the Office will recommend that Congress make any changes to the doctrine.   Cable Networks     Cable Rate Regulation. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (the "1992 Cable Act") directed the FCC to limit by regulation cable system rates for the "basic service tier" ("BST") (including retransmission consent and must carry broadcast signals and public, educational and governmental channels) and the "cable programming service tier" ("CPST") to a level not to exceed the rates that would be charged in the presence of effective competition. Programming offered on a per-channel or per-program basis is exempt from rate regulation.     Although all rate regulation of the CPST expired on March 31, 1999, local franchising authorities continue to be responsible for regulating the BST. The Company believes that cable rate regulation adversely affects its non-premium cable program services which rely on cable operator license fee support, along with advertising revenues, to maintain the quantity and quality of programming. Rate regulation in this area tends to erode cable operator incentives to invest in programming and particularly in start-up program services.     Program Access. The "program access" provisions of the 1992 Cable Act impose certain pricing and other restrictions on vertically integrated program providers (those program services that are owned in whole or in part by cable operators) with respect to the provision of their program services to multichannel programming distributors, such as cable systems, SMATV systems, MMDS operators and TVRO (TeleVision Receive Only) systems and DBS distributors. Specifically, vertically integrated program services generally are prohibited from entering into exclusive arrangements with cable operators and from discriminating against cable competitors on programming price and other terms. The program access provisions were intended to spur competition to cable providers by facilitating the access of cable competitors to programming owned by cable operators or their affiliates. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 extended the program access rules to program services in which common carriers that provide video programming have an attributable interest.     The Company divested its cable systems in 1996 and, as a result, the Company's wholly owned program services are no longer subject to the program access rules. Legislation which would extend the program access                                       I-25 provisions to non-vertically integrated program services, if enacted, could adversely impact the Company's program services by reducing the Company's flexibility to negotiate the most favorable terms available for the distribution of its content. However, no such legislation is pending in Congress at this time. The FCC, as directed by statute, will launch a rule making proceeding, likely toward the end of the year, to determine whether the existing prohibition against exclusive grants by vertically integrated program services to cable operators should extend beyond 2002.     Programming. Under FCC rules, cable operators must eventually close caption most of their programming on a phased-in basis, which began in January 1998. As a practical matter, however, cable networks assume responsibility for these closed captioning requirements. FCC rules also directed that all television receiver models with screens 13 inches or larger be equipped with "V-chip" technology as of January 1, 2000. This technology, which works in tandem with television ratings (age and content markers), permits parents to block out certain programming from their children. Most cable networks, including those of MTVN and SNI, voluntarily encode their programming with television ratings. In addition, the FCC in August 2000 adopted rules that require the top five basic cable networks to air 50 hours per quarter of programming containing audio descriptions of video for the visually impaired.   Broadcasting     General. Television and radio broadcasting are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, most recently amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcasting stations except under a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC, among other actions, to:    .  issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses;    .  assign frequency bands; determine stations' frequencies, locations and      operating power;    .  regulate some of the equipment used by stations;    .  adopt other regulations to carry out the provisions of the      Communications Act;    .  impose penalties for violation of such regulations; and    .  impose annual fees as well as fees for processing applications and other      administrative functions.     Under the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of the operation of cable television systems and other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations.     License Assignments. The Communications Act requires prior approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of a licensee. When passing on an assignment or transfer application, the FCC is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by an assignment or transfer to any party other than the assignee or transferee specified in the application.     License Renewals. Under the Communications Act, the FCC is authorized to renew broadcast licenses for terms of up to eight years. The Communications Act requires renewal of a broadcast license if the FCC finds that:    .  the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity;    .  there have been no serious violations of either the Communications Act      or the FCC's rules and regulations by the licensee; and    .  there have been no other serious violations that taken together      constitute a pattern of abuse.     In making its determination, the FCC may consider petitions to deny but cannot consider whether the public interest would be better served by a person other than the renewal applicant and competing applications for the same frequency may be accepted only after the FCC has denied an incumbent's application for renewal of license.                                       I-26 Ownership Regulation. The Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations also regulate broadcast ownership. The FCC has promulgated rules that, among other matters, limit the ability of individuals and entities to own or have an official position or ownership interest, known as an attributable interest, above a specific level in broadcast stations as well as other specified mass media entities. As discussed below, in August 1999, the FCC substantially revised a number of its multiple ownership and attribution rules and clarified some of those rules in January 2001. The FCC's various broadcast ownership rules, inclusive of the recent revisions, are summarized below.       Local Radio Ownership. With respect to radio licenses, the maximum   allowable number of stations that can be commonly owned in a market varies   depending on the number of radio stations within that market, as determined   using a method prescribed by the FCC. In markets with more than 45   stations, one company may own, operate or control up to eight radio   stations, with no more than five in either AM or FM. The FCC initiated a   rule making proceeding in December 2000, which proposes to modify the   manner in which the number of stations in a radio market is counted. If   adopted, such modification could impair on a going-forward basis the   ability of large radio station groups such as Infinity to enjoy economies   of scale permitted under the FCC's current radio market definition and   could potentially restrict their ability to freely sell existing   combinations. However the FCC's rule making proposes that existing radio   ownership combinations, such as those held by Infinity, would be   grandfathered.       Local Television Ownership. The FCC's television duopoly rule permits   parties to own two television stations without regard to signal contour   overlap provided they are located in separate markets referred to as   designated market areas. In addition, the rules permit parties in larger   designated market areas to own up to two television stations in the same   designated market area so long as at least eight independently owned and   operating full-power television stations remain in the market at the time   of acquisition and at least one of the two stations is not among the top   four-ranked stations in the market based on audience share. In calculating   the number of independently owned stations in a market, the FCC clarified   that it will count only those stations in a market whose signal contour   overlaps with that of at least one of the stations in the proposed   combination. Further, without regard to numbers of remaining or   independently owned TV stations, the FCC will permit television duopolies   within the same designated market area so long as certain signal contours   of the stations involved do not overlap.       "Satellite" stations that simply rebroadcast the programming of a   "parent" station will continue to be exempt from the duopoly rule if   located in the same designated market area as the parent station. The   duopoly rule also applies to same-market local marketing agreements   involving more than l5% of the brokered station's program time, although   current local marketing agreements will be exempt from the TV duopoly rule   for a limited period of time of either two or five years, depending on the   date of the adoption of the local marketing agreement. Further, the FCC may   grant a waiver of the TV duopoly rule if one of the two television stations   is a "failed" or "failing" station, or the proposed transaction would   result in the construction of a new television station.       As a result of the merger with CBS, the Company has duopolies in the   following six television markets: Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, Miami,   Detroit, and Pittsburgh. The Company has no in-market local marketing   agreements.       National Television Ownership Cap. On the national level, the FCC   imposes a 35 percent national audience reach cap for television ownership,   under which one party may not have an attributable interest in television   stations which reach more than 35 percent of all U.S. television   households. The Commission discounts the audience reach of a UHF station   for this purpose by 50 percent. Additionally, under FCC rules, for entities   that have attributable interests in two stations in the same market, the   FCC counts the audience reach of that market only once for national cap   purposes. Last May, as part of the Congressionally mandated biennial review   of broadcast ownership rules, the FCC determined to retain the 35% cap. At   the same time, the FCC voted to maintain the UHF discount.       After the May 4, 2000 merger with CBS, the television stations currently   held by the Company have an aggregate national audience reach for purposes   of the national ownership cap of approximately 41%. As                                       I-27 a condition of its approval of the merger, the FCC ordered the Company to   come into compliance with the national television ownership cap within 12   months of the merger closing date, which is May 4, 2001. The Company has   challenged the rule in federal court and is seeking a stay of the   requirement to come into compliance with the limit pending judicial review   of the national ownership cap.       Dual Network Rule. In the Telecommunications Act, Congress directed the   FCC to liberalize its rule, which then generally prohibited television   stations from affiliating with an entity that maintained more than one   national network. The FCC's implementing regulation states that a   television broadcast station may not affiliate with an entity that   maintains one of the existing four major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox)   and one of other specific qualifying networks in existence as of February   8, 1996. The legislative history of the dual network rule suggests that the   rule was intended to prohibit one of the four major networks from acquiring   either of The WB or UPN. After the merger with CBS, the Company owns both   the CBS and UPN networks. As a condition of its approval of the merger, the   FCC ordered the Company to come into compliance with the dual network rule   within 12 months of the May 4, 2000 merger closing date, which is May 4,   2001. The FCC initiated a rule making in June 2000, in which it proposes to   eliminate the dual network rule with respect to UPN and The WB. If the   proposal is adopted, the Company would be free to maintain both CBS and   UPN. The FCC is expected to issue the new rule within the next couple of   months.       Radio-Television Cross-Ownership. The so-called "one-to-a-market" rule   has until recently prohibited common ownership or control of a radio   station, whether AM, FM or both, and a television station in the same   market, subject to waivers in some circumstances. The FCC's new radio-   television cross-ownership rule embodies a graduated test based on the   number of independently owned media voices in the local market.       In large markets, i.e., markets with at least 20 independently owned   media voices, a single entity can own up to one television station and   seven radio stations or, if permissible under the new TV duopoly rule, two   television stations and six radio stations.       Waivers of the new radio-television cross-ownership rule will be granted   only under the failed station test. Unlike under the TV duopoly rule, the   FCC will not waive the radio-television cross-ownership rules in situations   of failing or unbuilt stations.       After the merger with CBS, the Company owned radio-television   combinations that exceeded the FCC's cross-ownership rule in five markets:   Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Sacramento and Baltimore. As a   result, in approving the merger, the FCC ordered the Company to come into   compliance with the radio-television cross-ownership rule within six months   of the May 4, 2000 merger closing, which was November 6, 2000. By that   date, the Company had entered into contracts and filed applications in each   of the five markets sufficient to comply with the conditions in the FCC   merger approval order.       Attribution of Ownership. Under the FCC's recently clarified attribution   rules, a direct or indirect purchaser of various types of securities of the   Company could violate FCC regulations or policies if that purchaser owned   or acquired an "attributable" interest in other media properties in the   same area as stations owned by the Company in a manner prohibited by the   FCC. Under the FCC's revised rules, an "attributable" interest for purposes   of the Commission's broadcast ownership rules generally includes:      .  equity and debt interests, which combined exceed 33% of a licensee's        total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of total        weekly programming, or is a same-market media entity, whether TV,        radio, cable or newspaper;      .  5% or greater voting stock interest;      .  20% or greater voting stock interest, if the holder is a qualified        passive investor;      .  any equity interest in a limited liability company or limited        partnership, unless properly "insulated" from management activities;        and      .  all officers and directors of a licensee and its direct or indirect        parent.                                       I-28 In a clarification of the attribution rules, which was issued in January   2001, the FCC eliminated the single majority shareholder exemption, which   previously had rendered as non-attributable interests up to 49% if the   licensee is controlled by a single majority shareholder. Minority interests   acquired prior to December 14, 2000 are grandfathered.     Alien Ownership. The Communications Act limits the ability of foreign entities or individuals to own or hold interests in broadcast licenses. As applicable to the Company, non-U.S. citizens, collectively, may directly or indirectly own or vote up to twenty percent of the capital stock of a corporate licensee. In addition, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any corporation that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by any other corporation more than one-fourth of whose capital stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations, if the FCC finds that the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before a broadcast license may be granted to or held by any such corporation, and the FCC has made such affirmative findings only in limited circumstances. The Company does periodic surveys of its public shareholders to ascertain compliance with this statute.     Digital Television Service. The FCC has taken a number of steps to implement digital television broadcasting service in the United States. The FCC has adopted a digital television table of allotments that provides all authorized television stations with a second channel on which to broadcast a digital television signal. The FCC has attempted to provide digital television coverage areas that are comparable to stations' existing service areas. The FCC has ruled that television broadcast licensees may use their digital channels for a wide variety of services such as high definition television, multiple channels of standard definition television programming, audio, data, and other types of communications, subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standard.     Digital television channels will generally be located in the range of channels from channel 2 through channel 51. The FCC has required affiliates of ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC in the top 10 television markets to begin digital broadcasting by May 1, 1999. Affiliates of the four major networks in the top 30 markets were required to begin digital broadcasting by November 1, 1999, and all other commercial broadcasters must do so by May 1, 2002. Many stations, including several of the Company's stations, have already begun digital broadcasting. The FCC's plan calls for the digital television transition period to end in the year 2006, at which time the FCC expects that television broadcasters will cease non-digital broadcasting and return one of their two channels to the government, allowing that spectrum to be recovered for other uses.     Under the Balanced Budget Act, however, the FCC is authorized to extend the December 31, 2006 deadline for reclamation of a television station's non- digital channel if, in any given market one or more television stations affiliated with ABC, CBS, NBC or Fox is not broadcasting digitally, and the FCC determines that such stations have "exercised due diligence" in attempting to convert to digital broadcasting; or less than 85% of the television households in the station's market subscribe to a multichannel video service that carries at least one digital channel from each of the local stations in that market, and less than 85% of the television households in the market can receive digital signals off the air using either a set-top converter box for an analog television set or a new digital television set.     The implementation of digital television will also impose substantial additional costs on television stations because of the need to replace equipment and because some stations will need to operate at higher utility costs and there can be no assurance that our television stations will be able to increase revenue to offset such costs. In addition, the Communications Act allows the FCC to charge a spectrum fee to broadcasters who use the digital spectrum to offer subscription-based services. The FCC has adopted rules that require broadcasters to pay a fee of 5% of gross revenues received from ancillary or supplementary uses of the digital spectrum for which they charge subscription fees, excluding revenues from the sale of commercial time. The Company cannot predict what future actions the FCC might take with respect to digital television, nor can it predict the effect of the FCC's                                       I-29 present digital television implementation plan or such future actions on the Company's business. The Company will incur considerable expense in the conversion to digital television and is unable to predict the extent or timing of consumer demand for any such digital television services.     Pursuant to Congressional mandate, the FCC will be auctioning that part of the spectrum now used by broadcasters operating on channels 60-69. The auction, now set for September 12, 2001, will draw bidders who will provide "third generation" wireless service upon broadcasters' surrender of their analog licenses. The Company has two television stations that operate on the channel 60-69 spectrum. These stations will not be adversely affected unless they are required to move to other channels before the digital television transition date. At this time, the FCC has stated that any such move by broadcasters will be on a voluntary basis only.     In January 2001, the FCC issued rules relating to the cable carriage of digital broadcast television signals, in which it determined that a commercial station operating in both analog and digital during the transition period may elect must carry or retransmission consent for its analog signal and retransmission consent for its digital signal. The FCC also tentatively concluded that it would reject mandatory "dual carriage," which would permit a local TV station to assert a right to carriage for both its analog and digital signals. However, the Commission issued a rule making to evaluate, among other things, the state of the digital television marketplace in order to determine whether a dual carriage requirement would violate the cable operators' First Amendment rights. The Company has concluded or is negotiating agreements with cable operators for the carriage of its stations' digital signals.     Satellite Carriage of Broadcast Television Stations. In 1999, Congress enacted the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA), which permits satellite carriers to retransmit a local television station's signal into its local market, subject to the consent of the local broadcaster. In March 2000, as directed under SHVIA, the FCC adopted rules that govern "good faith" negotiations between broadcasters and satellite carriers for retransmission consent. Superstations, defined to include certain stations affiliated with the UPN and WB networks, including WSBK-TV, Boston, which is owned by the Company, may be carried by satellite carriers nationally without consent. However, satellite carriers must apply network nonduplication, syndicated exclusivity and sports blackout protections to the retransmission of superstation signals. Further, until the end of 2004, the satellite carrier may retransmit distant network signals to households unserved by local network affiliates. Finally, beginning on January 1, 2002, satellite carriers will be required to carry the signals of all local broadcast stations, if they so request, in local markets in which the satellite carrier carries at least one signal under a local-to-local license. Almost all of the Company's CBS- affiliated television station signals and one UPN television station signal, pursuant to retransmission consent agreements, are being retransmitted into their local markets by the two major satellite carriers.     Programming. Under FCC rules, television stations must eventually close caption most of their programming on a phased-in basis, which began in January 1998. FCC rules also directed that all television receiver models with screens 13 inches or larger be equipped with "V-chip" technology as of January 1, 2000. This technology, which works in tandem with television ratings (age and content markers), permits parents to block out certain programming from their children. Most broadcasters, including CBS and UPN, voluntarily encode their programming with television ratings. In addition, the FCC in August 2000 adopted rules that require affiliates of the four major broadcast networks (including CBS) in the top 25 markets to air 50 hours per quarter of programming containing audio descriptions of video for the visually impaired.     Digital Audio Radio Service and Low-Power FM. The FCC has authorized or is considering authorizing various digital audio radio services. In January 1995, the FCC adopted rules to allocate spectrum for satellite digital audio radio services. The FCC has issued two authorizations to launch and operate satellite digital audio radio services (DARS), and the two companies holding those authorizations are expected to begin offering DARS some time in 2001. The FCC also has undertaken an inquiry into terrestrial digital audio radio. On November 1, 1999, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on that subject which solicited comments and proposals to implement terrestrial digital audio radio, including conversion to in-band on-channel transmissions by existing                                       I-30 radio broadcasters. Comments and reply comments were subsequently filed in that proceeding. The Company cannot predict the impact of either DARS or terrestrial digital audio radio services on its business. The Company has an ownership interest in iBiquity Digital Corporation, an entity which was created by the merger of USA Digital Radio, Inc. and Lucent Digital Radio and which is developing digital broadcasting technology, including technology for in-band on-channel terrestrial transmissions.     The FCC established a new low power FM service (LPFM) on January 20, 2000. The new LPFM stations are intended to operate in the existing FM band to provide small area, localized service. On December 21, 2000, the FCC announced that 255 noncommercial educational applicants in twenty states are eligible for LPFM licenses. Pursuant to Congressional legislation passed in mid- December, 2000, these applicants, and all future LPFM applicants, are eligible for LPFM licenses only if their proposed stations fully protect full service FM stations (and FM translator stations). At this time, the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, that LPFM authorizations might have on the Company's broadcast operations.   Outdoor Advertising     The outdoor advertising industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States at the federal, state and local levels. These regulations include restrictions on the construction, repair, upgrading, height, size and location of and, in some instances, content of advertising copy being displayed on outdoor advertising structures.     Federal law, principally the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 (Highway Beautification Act), encourages states, by the threat of withholding 10% of the federal appropriations for the construction and improvement of highways within such states, to implement state legislation to prohibit billboards located within 660 feet of, or visible from, interstate and primary highways, except in commercial or industrial areas where off-site signage is permitted provided it meets spacing and size restrictions. All of the states have implemented regulations at least as restrictive as the Highway Beautification Act. The Highway Beautification Act, and the various state statutes implementing it, require payment of just compensation whenever governmental authorities require legally erected and maintained billboards to be removed from areas adjacent to federally-aided highways.     State and local jurisdictions have, in some cases, passed additional and more restrictive regulations applicable to the construction, repair, upgrading, height, size and location of outdoor advertising structures adjacent to federally-aided highways and other thoroughfares. In some cases, the construction of new billboards or the relocation or modification of existing billboards is prohibited. From time to time, governmental authorities order the removal of billboards by the exercise of eminent domain. Thus far, the Company believes it has been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for its structures removed at the direction of governmental authorities, although there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so in the future.     Outdoor advertising in Canada is subject to regulation at the federal, provincial and municipal levels. These regulations may prohibit advertising of certain products on outdoor signs in certain locations. In Mexico, the placement of outdoor billboards is primarily regulated at the local level. For example, Mexico City regulates the placement of billboards near historical monuments. In France, outdoor advertising is regulated at the national, regional and local levels, including the regulation of content and the duration of certain contracts.     To date, regulations in the Company's outdoor advertising markets have not materially adversely affected its operations. However, the outdoor advertising industry is heavily regulated and at various times and in various markets can be expected to be subject to varying degrees of regulation affecting the operation of advertising displays. Accordingly, although the Company's experience to date is that the regulatory environment is not unduly restrictive, no assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations will not adversely affect the Company.                                       I-31 Video     BLOCKBUSTER is subject to various federal, state and local laws that govern the access and use of its video stores by disabled people and the disclosure and retention of video rental records. BLOCKBUSTER also must comply with various regulations affecting its business, including state and local advertising, consumer protection, credit protection, licensing, zoning, land use, construction, environmental, and minimum wage and other labor and employment regulations.     BLOCKBUSTER is also subject to the Trade Regulation Rule of the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") entitled "Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures" and state laws and regulations that govern (i) the offer and sale of franchises and (ii) franchise relationships. These regulations require BLOCKBUSTER to furnish each prospective franchisee with a current franchise offering circular prior to the offer or sale of a franchise. In addition, a number of states require that BLOCKBUSTER, as franchisor, comply with that state's registration or filing requirements prior to offering or selling a franchise in the state and provide a prospective franchisee with a current franchise offering circular complying with the state's laws, prior to the offer or sale of the franchise. BLOCKBUSTER intends to maintain a franchise offering circular that complies with all applicable federal and state franchise sales and other applicable laws.     BLOCKBUSTER is also subject to a number of state laws and regulations that regulate some substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, including (i) those governing the termination or non-renewal of a franchise agreement; (ii) requirements that the franchisor deal with its franchisees in good faith; (iii) prohibitions against interference with the right of free association among franchisees; and (iv) those regulating discrimination among franchisees in charges, royalties or fees.     Compliance with federal and state franchise laws is costly and time- consuming, and no assurance can be given that BLOCKBUSTER will not encounter difficulties or delays in this area or that it will not require significant capital for franchising activities.   Online     Web Sites Directed to Children. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which was implemented by the FTC in October 1999, applies to Web sites, or those portions of Web sites, directed to children under age 13. Under COPPA, Web site operators generally cannot collect online from a child under age 13 information that is individually identifiable such as a first and last name, an e-mail address or telephone number without the prior consent of that child's parent. The FTC rules became effective on April 21, 2000. Congress may also consider legislation this year or next regarding online privacy for adults.     Anti-Cybersquatting Legislation. In 1999, Congress enacted legislation to address the practice of domain name piracy. The legislation is designed to limit the practice of registering an Internet address of an established trademark with the hopes of selling the Internet address to the affected company. The legislation also includes a prohibition on the registration of a domain name that is the name of another living person, or a name that is confusingly similar to that name. There is a broad exemption for personal names linked to copyrighted works.  Intellectual Property     It is the Company's practice to protect its theatrical and television product, software, publications and its other original and acquired works. The following logos and trademarks and related trademark families are among those strongly identified with the product lines they represent and are significant assets of the Company: VIACOM(R), BLOCKBUSTER(R), CBS(R), CBS ENTERTAINMENT(TM), CBS NEWS(TM), CBS SPORTS(TM), INFINITY BROADCASTING(R), INFINITY OUTDOOR(TM), TDI(R), MTV: MUSIC TELEVISION(R), NICK AT NITE(R), NICKELODEON(R), TV LAND(R), VH1 MUSIC FIRST(TM), PARAMOUNT(R), FAMOUS MUSIC(R), BIG TICKET TELEVISION(R), PARAMOUNT PARKS(R), ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT(R), STAR TREK(R), SHOWTIME(R), THE MOVIE CHANNEL(R), FLIX(R), SIMON & SCHUSTER(R) and POCKET BOOKS(TM).                                       I-32 Employees and Labor Matters     At December 31, 2000, the Company employed approximately 133,830 people, of which approximately 57,840 were full-time salaried employees. Labor agreements covering the services of writers and actors which the Company utilizes in its motion picture and television businesses are currently scheduled to expire during 2001. Work stoppages and/or higher costs in connection with these agreements could adversely impact the ability of the Company to produce or acquire new programming.

The Company maintains its world headquarters at 1515 Broadway, New York, New York, where it rents approximately 1.2 million square feet for executive offices and certain of its operating divisions. The lease for the majority of the space runs to 2010, with four renewal options for five years each thereafter. The Company also leases the following major facilities in New York City for certain of its operating divisions: (a) approximately 548,000 square feet of office space at 1633 Broadway, New York, New York, which lease runs to 2010, and (b) approximately 237,000 square feet of office space at 1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, which lease runs to 2009. The Company owns the building located at 51 West 52nd Street New York, New York containing approximately 900,000 square feet which is utilized for executive and certain operating division offices or is leased to third parties, and the CBS Broadcast Center complex located on approximately 3.7 acres at 524 West 57th Street and consists of approximately 860,000 square feet. The Company also owns 3 studio facilities in California: (a) the Paramount Pictures studio at 5555 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, California, located on approximately 65 acres, (b) the CBS Studio Center at 4204 Radford Avenue, Studio City, California, located on approximately 40 acres, and (c) CBS Television City at 7800 Beverly Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, located on approximately 11 acres. PARAMOUNT PARKS' operations in the U.S. include approximately 1,950 acres owned and 108 acres leased and in Canada include approximately 380 acres owned. BLOCKBUSTER's headquarters at 1201 Elm Street, Dallas, Texas consists of approximately 240,000 square feet of leased space and its distribution center in McKinney, Texas consists of approximately 850,000 square feet of leased space.     The Company also owns and leases office, studio, retail and warehouse space, broadcast, antenna and satellite transmission facilities and outdoor advertising throughout the U.S., Canada and several countries around the world for its businesses. The Company considers its properties adequate for its present needs.                                       I-33 Item 3. Legal Proceedings.     Antitrust. The Company, Blockbuster and Paramount Home Entertainment are among the defendants in a lawsuit filed on July 21, 1999 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas by one former and three present independent video retailers against the major motion picture studios and the Company. The plaintiffs, purporting to act as class representatives on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, allege that the Company and the studios conspired among themselves and with Blockbuster to restrain competition in the nationwide market for distribution of videocassettes for rental to the public in violation of federal and California law. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief under federal law as well as triple the amount of the alleged actual damages to themselves and those similarly situated under California statutes. In January 2001, plaintiffs moved to withdraw their California state law claims from the federal lawsuit in Texas and filed a substantially similar complaint with approximately 200 additional named plaintiffs in Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles. This complaint also sought certification of a nationwide class of similarly situated plaintiffs. In March 2001, the Texas court denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification of both the federal and the California state law claims in the federal action and denied the plaintiffs' motion to withdraw their California state law claims from that action. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' position in these litigations is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously in the litigations.     The Company, through Paramount Pictures, is subject to a consent decree, entered in 1948, which contains restrictions on certain motion picture trade practices in the U.S. The Company, through Paramount Pictures, along with other major distributors, has received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Justice Department which is investigating possible violations of the industry- wide decrees. The Company believes that it has not committed any violation of the consent decree and has not been advised that the Department of Justice believes otherwise.     Other Matters. The Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits claiming various asbestos-related personal injuries, which allegedly occurred from use or inclusion of asbestos in certain products supplied by previously divested industrial business, generally in the pre-1970 time period. Typically, these lawsuits are brought against multiple defendants in state and federal courts. The Company was neither a manufacturer nor a producer of asbestos. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had pending approximately 99,590 asbestos cases, excluding cases in various stages of settlement. The Company has brought suit against certain of its insurance carriers with respect to asbestos claims. Under the terms of a settlement agreement resulting from this suit, carriers that have agreed to the settlement are now reimbursing the Company for a substantial portion of its current costs and settlement associated with asbestos claims. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to asbestos matters, that where appropriate it has adequately provided for resolution of matters and that any ultimate liability resulting from asbestos matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.     The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to discontinued operations conducted by companies acquired by the Company. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, on the basis of its experience and the information currently available to it, the Company does not believe that the claims it has received will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.     In addition to the above matters, the Company and various of its subsidiaries are parties to certain other legal proceedings. Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that these matters are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The Company believes that EBITDA is an appropriate measure of evaluating the operating performance of its segments. However, EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, operating income, net earnings, cash flows, and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). As EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Reported operating results for the year ended December 31, 2000 are not comparable with the prior year due to the CBS merger, merger-related charges and other non-recurring items.     On a pro forma basis, revenues increased 8% to $23.4 billion for 2000 from $21.7 billion for 1999 with double digit increases at the Cable Networks, Infinity and Video segments. Increased advertising revenues drove Cable Networks and Infinity revenue growth. Increased same store revenues and the increase in the number of Company-operated stores drove Video segment revenue growth.     On a reported basis, total expenses increased 61% to $18.7 billion for 2000 from $11.6 billion for 1999 principally reflecting expenses of CBS following the merger, an increase of $1.1 billion in amortization expense, merger related charges of $698 million and increases associated with revenue growth. On a pro forma basis, total expenses increased 5% to $21.2 billion for 2000 from $20.1 billion for 1999 principally reflecting increases associated with revenue growth.     On a reported basis, EBITDA and operating income increased 69% to $3.5 billion and 6% to $1.3 billion, respectively, for 2000 from $2.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively for 1999.  Segment Results of Operations 2000 versus 1999     Cable Networks (Basic Cable and Premium Subscription Television Program Services) ----------------------------------------------------- Year Ended                            December 31,       Percent                            2000     1999   Better/(Worse)     ----------------------------------------------------- As Reported:        Revenues          $3,895.0 $3,045.5       28%        Operating income  $1,250.0 $  932.4       34        EBITDA            $1,495.0 $1,053.1       42     -----------------------------------------------------      Pro Forma:        Revenues          $4,082.3 $3,610.0       13%        Operating income  $1,268.6 $1,006.0       26        EBITDA            $1,566.3 $1,296.3       21     ----------------------------------------------------- II-6 The Cable Networks segment is comprised of MTV Networks ("MTVN"), including, MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite, TV Land, TNN: The National Network and CMT, basic cable television program services; and Showtime Networks Inc. ("SNI"), owner of several premium subscription television program services.     For the year, MTVN revenues of $2.9 billion, EBITDA of $1.3 billion and operating income of $1.1 billion increased 29%, 42% and 33%, respectively. The increase in MTVN's revenues reflect 28% higher worldwide advertising revenues principally driven by rate increases at MTV, VH1 and TV Land and higher affiliate fees. MTVN's EBITDA and operating income gains were driven by the increased revenues partially offset by increased programming and production expenses, principally at MTV and VH1. On a pro forma basis, MTVN revenues of $3.0 billion and EBITDA of $1.4 billion increased 14% and 21%, respectively, over the prior year's pro forma revenues of $2.7 billion and EBITDA of $1.1 billion. Pro forma results are presented as if the acquisition of the CBS Cable Networks, TNN and CMT, had occurred on January 1, 1999.     For the year, SNI's revenues, EBITDA and operating income increased 10%, 21% and 24%, respectively, as compared with the prior year. The revenue increases were principally due to an increase of approximately 5.2 million subscriptions, up 22% over the prior year to 28.4 million subscriptions at December 31, 2000. Operating results reflect revenue increases attributable to the continued growth of direct broadcast satellite subscriptions partially offset by higher programming expenses and increased marketing for the promotion of original series.     On January 23, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of BET for approximately $3 billion, which principally represents the issuance of approximately 43.4 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the assumption by the Company of approximately $590 million in debt. Beginning first quarter of 2001, BET results will be reported as part of the Cable Networks segment.     Television (CBS and UPN Television Networks and Stations; Television Production and Syndication) ----------------------------------------------------- Year Ended                            December 31,       Percent                            2000     1999   Better/(Worse)     ----------------------------------------------------- As Reported:        Revenues          $5,381.7 $2,352.0      129%        Operating income  $  431.2 $  143.4      201        EBITDA            $  979.5 $  271.5      261     -----------------------------------------------------      Pro Forma:        Revenues          $7,255.4 $7,073.7        3%        Operating income  $  582.9 $  189.9      207        EBITDA            $1,335.6 $  954.3       40     ----------------------------------------------------- The Television segment is comprised of the CBS and UPN Television Networks and stations, television production and syndication.     For the year, Television segment pro forma revenues, EBITDA and operating income growth was principally driven by the strong performance at the CBS Network, television stations and at the United Paramount Network ("UPN"). CBS Network's pro forma revenues and EBITDA growth for 2000 were primarily due to increases in both upfront and scatter advertising pricing. Television stations pro forma results benefited from strong advertising pricing in local owned and operated TV markets. Approximately 80% of CBS Network's inventory for the 2000-2001 television season was sold in the upfront market and all day-parts achieved double digit price increases. The success of the CBS Network was led by its new reality-based television shows, including Survivor, the finale of which was second only to the Super Bowl as the most watched television event in 2000. Survivor also favorably impacted the ratings and revenue generated by other day parts, including News and Late Night. CBS Network's Monday night comedies, led by Everybody Loves Raymond, also posted significant year-to-year growth. CBS Network's strong revenue growth was partially offset by higher                                       II-7 programming costs and election year expenses. CBS Network had the top two new dramas in the fall season with CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and The District. CBS Enterprises, which includes King World productions, reported higher pro forma revenues and EBITDA primarily due to increased domestic license fees from The Oprah Winfrey Show and Hollywood Squares, partially offset by lower revenues from The Roseanne Show.     Paramount Television revenues for the full year 2000 were higher for continuing network and first run syndication shows including Entertainment Tonight, Judge Judy, Charmed, 7th Heaven and Judge Joe Brown. Syndication revenues included the first time syndication availability of Sabrina, The Teenage Witch and Moesha, and distribution fees from the initial syndication of Spin City; however, these contributions did not compare favorably with the prior year which included the last seasons of Beverly Hills 90210, Melrose Place, Sunset Beach, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and Sister, Sister and the first time syndication availability of JAG, Star Trek: Voyager, Viper and The Sentinel and higher library syndication revenues. Paramount Television's EBITDA also improved led by Frasier and Judge Judy combined with significant overhead savings resulting from the integration of Spelling Entertainment into Paramount Television. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 also benefited from the recognition of a cable retransmission royalty settlement.     Pro forma results assume that the CBS merger and the acquisitions of King World, two Texas television stations and the remaining 50% interest of UPN had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, exclude the third quarter 1999 Spelling restructuring charge and other non-recurring charges and reflect the adoption of the change in accounting as of January 1, 1999 as described below.     In the second quarter of 2000, the Company elected early adoption of the AICPA's Statement of Position "Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films" ("SOP 00-2") which is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2000. SOP 00-2 established new film accounting standards, including changes in revenue recognition and accounting for advertising, development and overhead costs. As a result of the early adoption, Television recorded a pre-tax charge of $330 million, primarily related to Spelling Entertainment. This charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting and is not included in EBITDA and operating income above. Partially as a result of the adoption of SOP 00-2, prior year pro forma results are higher than the prior year as reported results due to the timing of distribution costs as required by SOP 00-2. The Television segment's operating results for 2000 were reduced by approximately $9 million due to this accounting change.     License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on basic cable are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. As of December 31, 2000, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $622 million.     Infinity (Radio Stations, Outdoor Advertising Properties) ----------------------------------------------------- Year Ended                            December 31,       Percent                            2000     1999   Better/(Worse)     ----------------------------------------------------- As Reported:        Revenues          $2,764.7      --        NM        Operating income  $  589.4      --        NM        EBITDA            $1,282.6      --        NM     -----------------------------------------------------      Pro Forma:        Revenues          $4,037.2 $3,562.4       13%        Operating income  $  727.8 $  479.8       52        EBITDA            $1,794.1 $1,505.5       19     ----------------------------------------------------- NM--not meaningful                                       II-8 The Infinity segment is comprised of owned and operated radio stations and outdoor advertising properties.     For the year, Infinity Broadcasting, the Company's out-of-home media subsidiary, recorded pro forma revenues, EBITDA and operating income increases of 13%, 19% and 52%, respectively, principally driven by advertising revenue growth at both Infinity's radio stations and outdoor advertising businesses. Advertising revenue growth was primarily driven by higher advertising rates, reflecting increased demand for advertising at the majority of the radio stations and in the outdoor advertising business. Infinity Radio's pro forma net revenues and EBITDA increased 14% and 18%, respectively, principally reflecting strong growth in the top 15 radio markets, with New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco delivering double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth for the year. Infinity's outdoor advertising businesses pro forma net revenues and EBITDA increased 13% and 23%, respectively. Pro forma results assume the acquisition of Infinity Broadcasting, as part of the CBS merger, and the completion of all acquisitions and related divestitures of radio and outdoor properties by Infinity Broadcasting, including the acquisition of Infinity Outdoor, formerly known as Outdoor Systems, Inc. and 18 radio stations from Clear Channel, occurred at the beginning of each period presented.     On February 21, 2001, the Company announced the completion of its merger with Infinity Broadcasting. Under the terms of the merger, which is tax free for the stockholders of Infinity and Viacom, each share of Infinity Class A Common Stock not owned by the Company, approximately 36%, has been converted into the right to receive 0.592 of a share of Viacom Class B Common Stock.     Entertainment (Production and distribution of Motion Pictures; as well as the operation of Movie Theaters, Theme Parks and Music Publishing) ----------------------------------------------------- Year Ended                            December 31,       Percent                            2000     1999   Better/(Worse)     ----------------------------------------------------- As Reported:        Revenues          $2,758.3 $2,665.9        3%        Operating income  $  209.7 $  231.1       (9)        EBITDA            $  368.8 $  378.3       (3)     -----------------------------------------------------      Pro Forma:        Revenues          $2,758.3 $2,665.9        3%        Operating income  $  209.7 $  170.7       23        EBITDA            $  368.8 $  317.9       16     ----------------------------------------------------- The Entertainment segment is comprised of Paramount Pictures, movie theaters, Paramount Parks and music publishing.     For the year, Entertainment revenues increased 3% to $2.8 billion compared with the prior year, principally reflecting higher Features and Theaters revenues. Higher Features revenues were driven by increased worldwide theatrical and home video revenues as compared with 1999. Domestic theatrical revenues for 2000 included the strong performance of Mission: Impossible 2, What Women Want, Shaft, Rugrats in Paris: The Movie, Rules of Engagement, Snow Day and The Original Kings of Comedy. Foreign theatrical revenues for 2000 were higher primarily due to the success of Mission: Impossible 2, Shaft, Double Jeopardy and Sleepy Hollow. Home video revenues were higher and included contributions from Mission Impossible 2, Double Jeopardy, Runaway Bride, Sleepy Hollow and Rules of Engagement. Theater revenues were higher primarily as a result of additional new multiplex theaters opened since the end of 1999 and increased per capita spending. Parks' revenues were comparable with the prior year. Entertainment revenues for the prior year also included the recognition of a pay television license for library products and the renewal of a film processing agreement.     For the year, Entertainment's EBITDA and operating income decreased 3% and 9%, respectively, primarily due to lower Theaters profits as a result of higher operating costs and costs associated with opening additional                                       II-9 multiplexes in 2000. On a pro forma basis, Entertainment's EBITDA and operating income increased 16% and 23%, respectively, over the prior year. Pro forma results are presented as if the adoption of the change in accounting for motion pictures (as described below) had occurred at the beginning of each period presented. Parks' EBITDA and operating income for 2000 were higher than the prior year due to lower operating costs.     As a result of the Company's adoption of SOP 00-2 in the second quarter of 2000, Paramount Pictures recorded a pre-tax charge of $423 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting which is not included in EBITDA and operating income above. For 2000, Entertainment's operating results were reduced by approximately $20 million due to this accounting change. Prior year's pro forma results are lower than the as reported results due to the timing of when distribution expenses are recognized as required by SOP 00-2.     License fees for completed television exhibition of motion pictures are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. As of December 31, 2000, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $1.0 billion.     Video (Home Video and Game rental and retail through traditional stores and the Internet) --------------------------------------------------- Year Ended                            December 31,       Percent                            2000     1999   Better/(Worse)       --------------------------------------------------- Revenues          $4,960.1 $4,463.5       11%        Operating income  $   75.7 $  127.9      (41)        EBITDA            $  534.8 $  520.3        3       --------------------------------------------------- The Video segment is comprised of Blockbuster's operations in the home video, DVD and video game rental and retailing business through traditional stores and the Internet.     For the year, Video revenues increased 11% driven by an increase in same store revenues and the increase in the number of Company-operated stores. Worldwide same store revenues increased 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2000 and worldwide rental revenues increased 5.9%. For the year, international same store revenues increased 11.6% and domestic same store revenues increased 4.3% over 1999. Blockbuster ended the year with 7,677 company-owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 524 stores over the prior year.     Operating results for 2000 were impacted by Blockbuster's investment in its online operations, which began operations in the fourth quarter of 1999 and resulted in reductions to EBITDA and operating income of $53.4 million and $96.8 million, respectively. Excluding the amounts attributable to its online operations, Video's EBITDA and operating income increased 12% and 28%, respectively, as compared with the prior year. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2000, Blockbuster determined that the carrying value of certain hardware and capitalized software components primarily related to the e- commerce portion of its Internet site was impaired, and as a result, recorded a charge of approximately $31.6 million as part of depreciation expense. Pro forma results exclude the impact of this impairment charge from depreciation expense.     For the year, Video's gross margin decreased to 59.0% from 60.5% principally due to an increase in the percentage of total revenues generated through revenue-sharing arrangements, as revenue-sharing arrangements on average have lower gross margins than do traditional buying arrangements. Blockbuster is continually evaluating its product mix and product offerings, as well as related strategic offerings, to try to optimize its stores' revenues and gross profit. Blockbuster intends to continue to increase its stores' depth of DVDs and other home entertainment products in response to accelerated consumer acceptance of DVD and other home entertainment products. These initiatives to optimize stores' revenues and gross profit may cause Blockbuster to alter the product mix in its stores. This continued consumer shift to DVD format may cause Blockbuster to rationalize its stores existing product mix which could result in a non-cash charge.                                       II-10 Publishing (Consumer Publishing) ----------------------------------------------- Year Ended                          December 31,     Percent                           2000   1999  Better/(Worse)       ----------------------------------------------- Revenues          $596.0 $610.7       (2)%        Operating income  $ 49.6 $ 54.3       (9)        EBITDA            $ 71.3 $ 74.0       (4)       ----------------------------------------------- The Publishing segment is comprised of Simon & Schuster, which includes imprints such as Pocket Books, Scribner and The Free Press.     For the year, Publishing experienced lower net sales at the Pocket Books and Trade divisions primarily due to lower frontlist sales which drove the EBITDA and operating income declines partially offset by increased license fees and lower product costs. In 2000, Trade division's best-selling titles included Before I Say Good-bye by Mary Higgins Clark, On Writing by Stephen King and Seat of the Soul by Gary Zukav and the Children's division best selling titles included Olivia by Ian Falconer.

For the year the increase in Online revenues, as reported and pro forma, reflect increased license fees and higher advertising revenues. Operating losses, as reported and pro forma, were driven by increased marketing expenses for iWon.com (a consolidated subsidiary), which was launched in the fourth quarter of 1999, and increased spending at MTVi. Pro forma results assume the CBS merger had occurred at the beginning of each period presented. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company will present its online businesses as part of the Cable Networks and Television segments and the Company will account for iWon as a deconsolidated investment.   Other Income and Expense Information 2000 versus 1999   Corporate Expenses/Eliminations     Corporate expenses/eliminations, excluding depreciation expense, of $928.0 million for 2000 are intersegment profit eliminations of $103.2 million and $650 million of merger-related charges (of which $400 million was non-cash). Pro forma corporate expenses, excluding intersegment profit eliminations and depreciation expense, were $193.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared with $227.7 million for the prior year.                                       II-11 Depreciation and Amortization     For the year ended December 31, 2000, depreciation and amortization increased to $2.2 billion as compared with $844.7 million for 1999. This increase was primarily due to the Company's merger with CBS, which resulted in additional amortization expense of approximately $1.0 billion. The goodwill associated with the CBS merger of approximately $50 billion is being amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life which does not exceed 40 years.   Interest Expense     Interest expense increased 83% to $822.3 million for 2000 from $448.9 million for 1999 due to higher average debt outstanding during 2000 as the Company assumed $3.7 billion of debt with the CBS merger. The Company had approximately $12.7 billion and $6.0 billion principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities) at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 7.6% and 7.5%, respectively.   Interest Income     Interest income increased 92% to $53.2 million for 2000 from $27.7 million for 1999 due to higher marketable securities as a result of the CBS merger and favorable returns on investments.   Other Items, Net     In 2000, "Other items, net" of $8.8 million principally reflects foreign exchange gains of $31.7 million and net gains on the sale of assets of approximately $44.3 million which were mostly offset by the write down of several internet cost investments to their current market value for approximately $66.9 million. In 1999, "Other items, net" of $17.8 million principally reflects a $25.2 million foreign exchange gain partially offset by a net loss of approximately $7.4 million from the sale of assets.   Provision for Income Taxes     The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and foreign income taxes on earnings before income taxes. The annual effective tax rates of 73.4% for 2000, excluding the 2000 merger-related charges of $698 million, and 48.8% for 1999 were adversely affected by amortization of intangibles in excess of the amounts deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the non-deductible amortization of intangibles, the annual effective tax rates would have been 38.8% for 2000 and 35.4% for 1999.   Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies, Net of Tax     "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" was $124.2 million for 2000 as compared to $60.7 million for 1999, principally reflecting increased losses of internet equity ventures and losses in equity theater ventures partially offset by the improved performance of Comedy Central. In March 2000, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in UPN and began consolidating UPN's results of operations in the second quarter of 2000.   Minority Interest     Minority interest in 2000 primarily represents the minority ownership of Infinity Broadcasting and Blockbuster common stock. The Company acquired the remaining minority interest of Infinity Broadcasting that it did not own through a merger with Infinity, completed in February 2001.   Extraordinary Loss     In 1999, the Company recognized after-tax extraordinary losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $37.7 million, or a loss of $.06 per basic and diluted share.                                       II-12 Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle     For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recorded an after-tax non-cash charge of $452.3 million, or $.37 per basic and diluted share, resulting from the early adoption of the new accounting standard for motion pictures.   Net Earnings (Loss)     For the reasons described above, the Company reported a net loss of $816.1 million for 2000 as compared with net earnings of $334.0 million for 1999.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 1999 VERSUS 1998     Revenues increased 6% to $12.9 billion for 1999 from $12.1 billion for 1998. Revenue increases were paced by gains in the Cable Networks, Video and Publishing segments. Cable Networks recorded higher advertising revenues and affiliate fees for the year. Video's revenue gains were led by increases in worldwide same store sales and the increased number of system-wide stores in 1999. Entertainment's revenues were down slightly for the year as its worldwide theatrical and home video contributions did not match the extraordinary box office and home video success in 1998 of Titanic, Deep Impact and the theatrical performance of Saving Private Ryan.     Total expenses increased 3% to $11.6 billion for 1999 from $11.3 billion for 1998 principally reflecting normal increases associated with revenue growth and the Spelling charge of $81.1 million. In addition, results for 1998 include the second quarter Blockbuster charge of $424.3 million associated with an adjustment to the carrying value of rental tapes due to a new method of accounting.     EBITDA and operating income increased 37% to $2.1 billion and 66% to $1.2 billion, respectively, for 1999 from $1.5 billion and $751.6 million, respectively, for 1998. Excluding the impact of the Spelling charge recorded in the third quarter of 1999 and the second quarter 1998 Blockbuster charge from the results presented above, EBITDA increased 11% and operating income increased 13% for 1999.   Segment Results of Operations 1999 versus 1998     The following discussion of Viacom's segment results has been reclassified to conform to the 2000 segment presentation. No pro forma discussion is presented for the 1999 versus 1998 yearly results.     Cable Networks (Basic Cable and Premium Subscription Television Program Services) --------------------------------------------------- Year Ended                            December 31,       Percent                            1999     1998   Better/(Worse)       --------------------------------------------------- Revenues          $3,045.5 $2,607.9       17%        Operating income  $  932.4 $  744.3       25        EBITDA            $1,053.1 $  851.3       24       --------------------------------------------------- For the year, MTVN revenues of $2.25 billion, EBITDA of $915.1 million and operating income of $816.9 million increased 21%, 23% and 24%, respectively. The increase in MTVN's revenues principally reflects higher worldwide advertising revenues, up 22% for the year, and higher affiliate fees, up 13%, along with the success of MTVN's consumer products licensing programs, including Rugrats and Blue's Clues. Advertising revenue growth was driven by rate increases at VH1 and MTV and higher unit volume at MTV. Nickelodeon's advertising revenue growth was driven by the increased number of units sold and lower average unit rates which was principally due to a 2% decline in spending in the Kids' advertising segment during 1999 as well as increased competition in that category. The increased revenues drove MTVN's EBITDA and operating income gains.                                       II-13 SNI's revenues, EBITDA and operating income increased 7%, 14% and 19%, respectively, over the prior year. The revenue increases were principally due to an increase of approximately 3.5 million subscriptions, up 18% over the prior year to 23.2 million subscriptions at December 31, 1999. Operating results reflect revenue increases attributable to the continued growth of direct broadcast satellite subscriptions, as well as higher programming, marketing and advertising expenses to support subscription growth, and SNI's original films and branding initiatives.     Television (Television Stations; Television Production and Syndication) --------------------------------------------------- Year Ended                            December 31,       Percent                            1999     1998   Better/(Worse)       --------------------------------------------------- Revenues          $2,352.0 $2,271.4        4%        Operating income  $  143.4 $  262.4      (45)        EBITDA            $  271.5 $  372.9      (27)       --------------------------------------------------- For the year, Television revenues were higher primarily due to higher syndication revenues from Judge Judy, the first time availability of JAG, Star Trek: Voyager, The Sentinel and Viper, and from an additional season of Sister, Sister. Television programming revenues for the year also benefited from the recognition of a cable retransmission royalty settlement. For the year, the increase in programming revenues was partially offset by lower library syndication revenues.     Television's EBITDA and operating income decreased 27% and 45%, respectively, as the 1999 results were impacted by the Spelling charge. The Spelling charge of $81.1 million was incurred in the third quarter of 1999, of which $70.3 million was recorded as a restructuring charge and $10.8 million was recorded as part of depreciation expense. The restructuring charge was primarily associated with the integration of Spelling's operations into Paramount Television, resulting in the elimination of duplicative sales forces and certain other back office functions. Excluding the impact of the Spelling charge, Television's EBITDA and operating income decreased 8% and 14%, respectively. For the year, Paramount television stations' revenues increased 2% to $437.1 million, EBITDA increased 2% to $151.5 million and operating income increased 1% to $100.6 million.     License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on basic cable are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. As of December 31, 1999, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $462.1 million.     Entertainment (Production and distribution of Motion Pictures; as well as the operation of Movie Theaters, Theme Parks and Music Publishing) --------------------------------------------------- Year Ended                            December 31,       Percent                            1999     1998   Better/(Worse)       --------------------------------------------------- Revenues          $2,665.9 $2,914.3       (9)%        Operating income  $  231.1 $  235.5       (2)        EBITDA            $  378.3 $  368.7        3       --------------------------------------------------- For the year, Entertainment's revenues decreased as 1999 results did not match the prior year's extraordinary box office and home video success of Titanic and Deep Impact and the theatrical performance of Saving Private Ryan. Entertainment's revenues included strong theatrical contributions from Varsity Blues, Payback, The General's Daughter, Runaway Bride, Double Jeopardy, Sleepy Hollow and The Talented Mr. Ripley, but did not match 1998's box office success of Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, Deep Impact, The Truman Show and The Rugrats Movie. Foreign home video revenues were higher primarily driven by Saving Private Ryan, The Rugrats Movie and The Truman Show, but were offset by lower domestic home video revenues which did not match                                       II-14 1998's release of Titanic. Theaters' revenues were higher primarily as a result of the new multiplex theaters opened since the end of 1998.     Entertainment's EBITDA increased 3% principally due to the revenue items discussed above and a change in product mix while operating income decreased 2% reflecting higher depreciation expense for new theaters opened since the end of 1998. Theaters' EBITDA and operating income were lower for the year primarily due to the one-time costs associated with opening new multiplexes.     Theme Parks' revenue, EBITDA and operating income declines for the year reflect declines in overall attendance primarily due to increased competition at two of the parks and generally less than favorable weather conditions.     License fees for the television exhibition of motion pictures and for syndication and basic cable exhibition of television programming are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. As of December 31, 1999, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $1.2 billion.     Video (Home Video and Game rental and retail through traditional stores and the Internet) ---------------------------------------------------- Year Ended                            December 31,        Percent                            1999     1998    Better/(Worse)       ---------------------------------------------------- Revenues          $4,463.5 $3,893.4        15%        Operating income  $  127.9 $ (342.2)       NM        EBITDA            $  520.3 $   39.9        NM       ---------------------------------------------------- NM--not meaningful     For the year, Video's revenues were higher principally due to higher worldwide same store sales and the increased number of system-wide video stores. Worldwide same store sales, including rental and retail product, increased 8.3%, and worldwide same store rental revenues increased 10.1%. The increase in same store revenues was principally due to increases in the average domestic rental fee and increased sales of previously-viewed tapes. Blockbuster ended the year with 7,153 stores, a net increase of 772 stores over the prior year.     Video's EBITDA increased to $520.3 million in 1999 from $39.9 million in 1998. The 1999 results reflect Blockbuster's investment in its Internet business which resulted in a reduction to EBITDA and operating income of $6.6 million and $7.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1999. The 1998 results reflect a charge taken in the second quarter of $424.3 million associated with an adjustment to the carrying value of rental tapes due to a new method of accounting.     Excluding the amounts attributable to the investment in its Internet business and the effects of the 1998 charge, Video's EBITDA increased by $62.7 million, or 14%, reflecting the continuing success of revenue growth programs implemented in the first quarter of 1999 which emphasize tape copy depth, promote customer loyalty and reward customer frequency. For the year, Video's gross margin percentage decreased slightly to 60.5% from 60.8%, excluding the Internet business' results in 1999 and the $424.3 million charge taken in 1998.     Publishing (Consumer Publishing) ----------------------------------------------- Year Ended                          December 31,     Percent                           1999   1998  Better/(Worse)       ----------------------------------------------- Revenues          $610.7 $564.6        8%        Operating income  $ 54.3 $ 53.2        2        EBITDA            $ 74.0 $ 71.2        4       ----------------------------------------------- II-15 For the year, the improved revenues and operating results are due principally to higher sales in the Trade division, led by the best selling titles Tis by Frank McCourt, Hearts in Atlantis by Stephen King and When Pride Still Mattered by David Maraniss. The Children's division revenues also increased for the year driven by higher sales including the best-selling title The Dance by Richard Paul Evans and Eloise at Christmastime by Kay Thompson.     On November 27, 1998, the Company completed the sale of Non-Consumer Publishing for $4.6 billion in cash. The Company realized a gain of $65.5 million, net of tax, from the sale and presented Non-Consumer Publishing as a discontinued operation for 1998 and for all prior periods.     Online (Interactive Online Services) ------------------------------------------------ Year Ended                          December 31,      Percent                           1999   1998   Better/(Worse)       ------------------------------------------------ Revenues          $ 29.8  $13.7       118%        Operating income  $(64.5) $(7.5)       NM        EBITDA            $(48.4) $(3.5)       NM       ------------------------------------------------ NM--not meaningful     Revenue increases for the year principally reflect increased license fees and higher advertising revenues. The operating losses reflect the continued investments in the Company's online services.     On July 15, 1999, the Company together with Liberty Digital Inc. formed the MTVi Group, L.P. ("MTVi"). The Company contributed all of its assets used exclusively in its Internet music businesses, including the assets of Imagine Radio, which the Company acquired in February 1999, in exchange for a 90% equity interest in MTVi. Liberty Digital Inc. contributed all of its assets used in its Internet music businesses, including SonicNet.com and assets of The Box Worldwide, Inc. (certain of which were concurrently licensed to MTVN) in exchange for a 10% equity interest in MTVi.   Other Income and Expense Information 1999 versus 1998   Corporate Expenses/Eliminations     Corporate expenses/eliminations, excluding depreciation expense, decreased 9% to $156.8 million for 1999 from $171.6 million for 1998. Corporate expenses of $174.1 million in 1999 increased 7% from $162.0 million in 1998 while the benefit from eliminations of $17.3 million increased over the prior year by approximately $21 million principally due to the timing of the recognition of intersegment sales.   Interest Expense     Interest expense decreased 28% to $448.9 million for 1999 from $622.4 million for 1998 due to lower average debt outstanding of $5.8 billion during 1999 versus $7.4 billion during 1998. The Company had approximately $6.0 billion and $4.2 billion principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities) at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 7.5% and 7.8%, respectively.   Interest Income     Interest income increased 18% to $27.7 million for 1999 from $23.4 million for 1998.   Other Items, Net     "Other items, net" reflects $17.8 million of income for 1999 compared to a loss of $15.3 million in 1998. The net increase of $33.1 million principally reflects a $25.2 million foreign exchange gain in 1999 compared to a $7.4 million foreign exchange loss in 1998. "Other items, net" also includes a net loss of approximately $7.4                                       II-16 million from the sale of assets in 1999 and the loss of approximately $91 million associated with the closing of the Viacom Entertainment Store partially offset by a net gain of approximately $82.9 million from the sale of assets in 1998.   Provision for Income Taxes     The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and foreign income taxes on earnings before income taxes. The annual effective tax rates of 48.8% for 1999 and 101.0% for 1998 were both adversely affected by amortization of intangibles in excess of amounts which are deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the non-deductible amortization of intangibles, the annual effective tax rates would have been 35.4% for 1999 and 31.8% for 1998.   Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies, Net of Tax     "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" was $60.7 million for 1999 as compared to $41.4 million for 1998 principally reflecting increased net operating losses of UPN and international ventures partially offset by the improved results of Comedy Central.   Minority Interest     Minority interest primarily represents the minority ownership of Blockbuster common stock in 1999 and Spelling common stock in 1998.   Discontinued Operations     For 1998, discontinued operations reflect the results of operations, net of tax, of Non-Consumer Publishing and the music retail stores which were sold on November 27, 1998 and October 26, 1998, respectively. Discontinued operations also reflect the gain from the sale of Non-Consumer Publishing of $65.5 million, net of tax, the loss from the sale of music retail stores of $138.5 million, net of tax, additional losses recognized for Virgin Interactive operations prior to disposal of $20.3 million, net of minority interest, the tax benefit associated with the disposal of Virgin Interactive of $134.0 million and the reversal of excess cable split-off reserves.   Extraordinary Loss     During 1999 and 1998, the Company recognized after-tax extraordinary losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $37.7 million and $74.7 million, respectively.   Net Earnings (Loss)     For the reasons described above, net earnings of $334.0 million for 1999 increased $456.4 million from a loss of $122.4 million for 1998.   Acquisitions and Merger-Related Charges     On May 4, 2000, CBS was merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). The total purchase price of approximately $39.8 billion included approximately $37.7 billion for the issuance of 825.5 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and 11,004 shares of Viacom Series C convertible preferred stock, which were subsequently converted into 11.0 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and approximately $1.9 billion for the fair value of CBS stock options assumed by the Company and transaction costs. In addition, Viacom assumed approximately $3.7 billion of CBS debt.     The Company presently holds television stations which reach approximately 41% of United States television households (as calculated for this purpose under rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC"), which apply a 50% discount to the reach of UHF stations). These stations reach approximately 6% in excess of the 35% limit permitted by FCC regulations. In connection with FCC approval of the Merger, the Company was given one year to come into compliance with the limit. The Company has                                       II-17 challenged the rule in federal court and is seeking a stay of the requirement to come into compliance with the limit pending judicial review of the national ownership cap. The Company was also provided with one year to come into compliance with the FCC's "dual network" rule, which prohibits the Company from owning and controlling both CBS and UPN. On June 20, 2000, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making, in which it proposes to modify the dual network rule, the effect of which would be to permit the Company to own both CBS and UPN.     In the second quarter of 2000, the Company recorded non-recurring merger- related charges of $698 million ($505 million after-tax or $.41 per share), associated with the integration of Viacom and CBS and the acquisition of UPN (see Note 3). These amounts included non-cash charges of $415 million principally attributable to compensation for stock options and $283 million of cash payments and accrued liabilities for severance, transaction fees and costs. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had paid and charged approximately $92 million for severance liabilities, $27 million for transaction fees and $6 million related to integration costs.     In June 1999, the Company completed its tender offer for all outstanding shares of Spelling common stock that it did not already own for $9.75 per share in cash and then acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Spelling not tendered through a merger of Spelling and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the merger, each share of Spelling common stock was also converted into the right to receive $9.75 in cash. The consideration for tendered shares was approximately $176 million.     In connection with the integration of the operations of Spelling into Paramount Television, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $81.1 million, of which $70.3 million was recorded as a restructuring charge and $10.8 million was recorded as part of depreciation expense in the third quarter of 1999. Included in the charge were severance and employee related costs of $48.1 million, lease termination and other occupancy costs of $17.7 million and other exit costs of $4.5 million. Severance and other employee related costs represent the costs to terminate approximately 250 employees engaged in legal, sales, marketing, finance, information systems, technical support and human resources for Spelling. Lease termination and other occupancy costs principally represent the expenses associated with vacating existing lease obligations in New York and Los Angeles. The depreciation expense of approximately $10.8 million was associated with the fixed asset write-offs for software, leasehold improvements and equipment located at these premises. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had paid and charged approximately $43.6 million against the severance liability, $11.3 million against lease termination and other occupancy costs, and $2.0 million against the other exit costs.   Other Acquisitions     On February 21, 2001, the Company completed a merger with Infinity Broadcasting, acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of Infinity common stock that it did not already own, approximately 36%. Under the terms of the merger, which is tax free for the stockholders of Infinity and Viacom, each share of Infinity Class A common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.592 of a share of Viacom Class B Common Stock. The total purchase price of approximately $13.4 billion represents the issuance of approximately 232 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the fair value of Infinity stock options assumed by the Company.     On January 23, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of BET for approximately $3 billion, which principally represents the issuance of approximately 43.4 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the assumption by the Company of approximately $590 million in debt.     On September 15, 2000, Infinity Broadcasting completed the acquisition of Memphis radio stations WMC-AM and WMC-FM from Raycom Media for approximately $76 million.     On August 24, 2000, Infinity Broadcasting completed the acquisition of 18 radio stations from Clear Channel for $1.4 billion in an asset transaction. These stations are located in San Diego, Phoenix, Denver, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Orlando and Greensboro--Winston-Salem.                                       II-18 On July 1, 2000, Infinity Broadcasting completed the acquisition of Waterman Broadcasting Corporation of Texas ("Waterman Broadcasting") in exchange for approximately 2.7 million shares of Infinity Broadcasting Class A common stock valued at approximately $88 million. Waterman Broadcasting owns radio stations KTSA-AM and KTFM-FM in San Antonio, Texas.     During the second quarter of 2000, Infinity Broadcasting completed the acquisition of Giraudy, one of France's largest outdoor advertising companies, for approximately $400 million. Infinity Broadcasting also acquired Societa Manifesti & Affisioni S.p.A., one of the leading Italian outdoor media sales companies, for approximately $90 million.     On March 31, 2000, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in UPN that it did not already own. In the second quarter of 2000, the Company consolidated UPN's results of operations. Prior to this acquisition, the Company reported its proportionate share of net losses of UPN in "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Liquidity and Capital Resources     The Company expects to fund its anticipated cash requirements (including the anticipated cash requirements of its capital expenditures, share repurchase programs, joint ventures, commitments and payments of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness) with internally generated funds, in addition to various external sources of funds. The external sources of funds may include the Company's access to commercial paper and the Company's credit agreements, co-financing arrangements by the Company's various divisions relating to the production of entertainment products, and/or additional financings.     As of December 31, 2000, the Company had certain restrictions on Infinity Broadcasting's cash balance of $143.0 million, reflected in the Company's consolidated cash amount of $934.5 million. Infinity Broadcasting's cash became available to Viacom upon the merger of Infinity into a subsidiary of Viacom, effective February 21, 2001.     Subsequent to its August 1999 initial public offering, Blockbuster no longer participates in the Company's centralized cash management system. Cash generated by Blockbuster's operations is expected to be retained by Blockbuster to fund its anticipated cash requirements.     The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering debt securities, preferred stock and warrants of Viacom that may be issued for aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 billion. The registration statement was declared effective on January 8, 2001. The net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by Viacom for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital and capital expenditures; or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. To date, the Company has not issued any securities under the shelf registration statement.     On July 7, 1999, the Viacom Five-Year Warrants expired. The Company received proceeds of approximately $317 million and issued approximately 9.0 million shares of its Class B Common Stock in connection with the exercise of 4.5 million warrants issued as part of the 1994 acquisition of Paramount Communications.     At December 31, 2000, National Amusements, Inc. ("NAI") beneficially owned approximately 68% of Viacom Inc. Class A Common Stock and approximately 13% of Class A and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis.   Share Repurchase Programs     During 2000, the Company repurchased 10,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock and 34.2 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $1.95 billion in the aggregate. Fourth quarter 2000 repurchases                                       II-19 included in this total amounted to $356.8 million. In January 2001, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $56.3 million. On February 1, 2001, the Company initiated a new repurchase program to acquire up to $2.0 billion of Viacom Class B Common Stock, and through March 19, 2001, the Company had repurchased under this program 2.8 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for $141.5 million.     During 1999, the Company had repurchased 25,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock, 10.6 million shares of its Class B Common Stock and 1.1 million Viacom Five-Year Warrants, for approximately $466.4 million in the aggregate. During 1998, the Company had repurchased a total of 12,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock, 26.2 million shares of its Class B Common Stock and 5.5 million Viacom Five-Year Warrants, for approximately $822.0 million in the aggregate.     On December 2, 1998, the Company repurchased 12 million shares of its convertible preferred stock from Bell Atlantic Corporation for $564 million in cash. On January 5, 1999, the Company repurchased the remaining 12 million shares of its convertible preferred stock from Bell Atlantic Corporation for $612 million in cash.   Commitments and Contingencies     The Company, Blockbuster and Paramount Home Entertainment are among the defendants in a lawsuit filed on July 21, 1999 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas by one former and three present independent video retailers against the major motion picture studios and the Company. The plaintiffs, purporting to act as class representatives on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, allege that the Company and the studios conspired among themselves and with Blockbuster to restrain competition in the nationwide market for distribution of videocassettes for rental to the public in violation of federal and California law. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief under federal law as well as triple the amount of the alleged actual damages to themselves and those similarly situated under California statutes. In January 2001, plaintiffs moved to withdraw their California state law claims from the federal lawsuit in Texas and filed a substantially similar complaint with approximately 200 additional named plaintiffs in Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles. This complaint also sought certification of a nationwide class of similarly situated plaintiffs. In March 2001, the Texas court denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification of both the federal and the California state law claims in the federal action and denied the plaintiffs' motion to withdraw their California state law claims from that action. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' position in these litigations is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously in the litigations.     The Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits claiming various asbestos- related personal injuries, which allegedly occurred from use or inclusion of asbestos in certain products supplied by previously divested industrial business, generally in the pre-1970 time period. Typically, these lawsuits are brought against multiple defendants in state and Federal courts. The Company was neither a manufacturer nor a producer of asbestos. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had pending approximately 99,590 asbestos cases, excluding cases in various stages of settlement. The Company has brought suit against certain of its insurance carriers with respect to asbestos claims. Under the terms of a settlement agreement resulting from this suit, carriers that have agreed to the settlement are now reimbursing the Company for a substantial portion of its current costs and settlement associated with asbestos claims. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to asbestos matters, that where appropriate it has adequately provided for resolution of matters and that any ultimate liability resulting from asbestos matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.     The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages, principally relating to discontinued operations conducted by companies acquired by the Company. The Company's liabilities reflect management's best estimate of its environmental exposure. Such liability was not discounted or reduced by potential insurance recoveries and reflects management's estimate of cost sharing at                                       II-20 multiparty sites. The estimated liability was calculated based upon currently available facts, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. On the basis of its experience and the information currently available to it, the Company believes that the claims it has received will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity.     In addition to the above matters, the Company and various of its subsidiaries are parties to certain other legal proceedings. Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that these matters are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.     The commitments of the Company for program license fees, estimated to aggregate approximately $15.2 billion, are not reflected in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2000. These commitments include approximately $10.8 billion for the acquisition of sports programming rights. A majority of such fees are payable over several years, as part of normal programming expenditures. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's future minimum lease commitments and franchise payments.   Financial Position     Current assets increased to $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2000 from $5.2 billion as of December 31, 1999, due to the addition of approximately $2.9 billion in current assets resulting from the CBS merger, partially offset by a reduction in inventory reflecting the impact of the adoption of SOP 00-2. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables decreased to 5.8% for 2000 from 6.1% for 1999. The change in property and equipment principally reflects the addition of approximately $3.1 billion in fixed assets due to the Merger and capital expenditures of $659.0 million for new and existing video stores and construction of new movie theaters, partially offset by depreciation expense of $799.7 million. Intangibles of $62.0 billion at December 31, 2000 increased by $50.5 billion compared to $11.5 billion as of December 31, 1999, principally reflecting the CBS merger and other acquisitions. Current liabilities increased $3.4 billion to $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2000 due to the addition of approximately $3.2 billion resulting from the Merger. Non-current liabilities of $19.9 billion reflect the inclusion of $3.7 billion of debt and $5.6 billion of other liabilities from the Merger. The minority interest balance of $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2000 included $5.7 billion of the minority ownership interest of Infinity.     The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. The Company's receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2000, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company's products and services are sold.   Cash Flows     Net cash flow provided by operating activities of $2.3 billion in 2000 primarily reflects the net loss of $816.1 million adjusted for non-cash expenses of $2.2 billion for depreciation and amortization, $415 million of merger-related charges and $753.9 million for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle partially offset by increases to receivables and payment of accrued liabilities. Net cash flow from operations of $294.1 million in 1999 primarily reflected net earnings of $334.0 million plus depreciation and amortization expenses of $844.7 million, partially offset by the increased investment in inventory of $512.7 million and an increase in unbilled receivables of $120.7 million. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $2.9 billion for 2000 principally reflect capital expenditures of $659.0 million and acquisitions of $2.4 billion principally for radio stations and outdoor businesses. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.1 billion for 1999 principally reflect capital expenditures and the Spelling transaction as well as acquisitions of video stores and television stations. Financing activities for 2000 principally reflect approximately $3.1 billion of borrowings from banks and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and debentures partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock. Financing activities for 1999 principally reflect borrowings and repayment of debt as well as the repurchase of the Company's common stock, warrants and convertible preferred stock.                                       II-21 Planned capital expenditures, including information systems costs, are approximately $625 million to $675 million in 2001. Capital expenditures are primarily related to capital additions for cable networks, television and radio equipment, new and existing video stores and theme park attractions. The Company's joint ventures are expected to require estimated net cash contributions of approximately $15 million to $25 million in 2001.     For the year ended December 31, 2000, cash flow from operating activities used to fund federal, state and local and foreign income taxes amounted to $61.2 million. Certain non-recurring tax deductions significantly reduced cash taxes paid in 2000. These tax deductions in the aggregate totaled $2.3 billion and included severance costs relating to the Merger, the adoption of SOP 00-2, the amortization of a prior year cumulative change in an income tax method of accounting for inventory at Blockbuster, stock option exercises and limited right stock option exercises arising from the Merger. With the absence of such deductions, cash taxes to be paid in 2001 are expected to increase significantly.  Capital Structure     The following table sets forth the Company's long-term debt: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- At December 31,                                       2000      1999       ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes payable to banks, including commercial paper  $ 5,735.5 $3,054.2        Senior debt                                           5,662.7  2,310.9        Senior subordinated debt                                664.4     35.3        Subordinated debt                                        39.4      --        Other notes                                              43.5      --        Obligations under capital leases                        552.2    591.6       -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             12,697.7  5,992.0        Less current portion                                    223.9    294.3       -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            $12,473.8 $5,697.7       ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Debt, including the current portion, as a percentage of total capitalization of the Company decreased to 21% at December 31, 2000 from 35% at December 31, 1999.     As a result of the Merger, Viacom assumed approximately $3.7 billion of CBS debt.     On March 28, 2000, the Viacom Credit Agreements were amended to allow for the merger of CBS with and into the Company. On April 17, 2000, the CBS credit agreement, which consisted of a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing August 29, 2001 and the Infinity credit agreement, which consisted of a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing August 29, 2001, were amended to allow for the merger of CBS with and into the Company. On May 3, 2000, Infinity Broadcasting entered into two new credit facilities, totaling $1.95 billion, comprised of a $1.45 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and a $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility. Borrowing rates under the CBS and Infinity facilities were determined at the time of each borrowing and were based generally on a floating rate index, the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR"), plus a margin based on the respective senior unsecured debt rating.     On March 7, 2001, the Company cancelled all of the above-mentioned credit agreements other than the Infinity Broadcasting $1.45 billion facility, and entered into two new credit facilities. These two new facilities total $3.5 billion and are comprised of a $1.5 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and a $2.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility. The Company also amended and restated the Infinity Broadcasting $1.45 billion facility, substantially to conform to the terms and conditions of the new $1.5 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and to designate the Company as the borrower. The primary purpose of the facilities is to support commercial paper borrowings. The Company, at its option, may borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the new $1.5 billion 5-year revolving credit facility. Borrowing rates under the facilities are determined                                       II-22 at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on LIBOR plus a margin based on the Company's senior unsecured debt rating. At December 31, 2000, LIBOR for borrowing periods of one month and two months were 6.56% and 6.49%, respectively.     The new and amended facilities contain certain covenants which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2000, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants. The Company expects to be in compliance and satisfy all such covenants as may be applicable from time to time during 2001.     The Company pays a commitment fee based on the total amount of the loan commitments. As of March 7, 2001, the facilities totaled $4.95 billion.     In March 2001, the Company increased its commercial paper program from $4.0 billion to $4.95 billion and Infinity Broadcasting cancelled its $3.25 billion commercial paper program. Borrowings under the program have maturities of less than a year and are supported by unused committed bank facilities. At December 31, 2000, the Company had borrowings under the program of approximately $1.7 billion and Infinity Broadcasting had borrowings under its commercial paper program of approximately $2.1 billion.     On January 9, 2001, the Company issued, under Rule 144A, $400 million of 6.40% unsecured senior notes due January 30, 2006, $500 million of 7.70% unsecured senior notes due July 30, 2010, and $750 million of 7.875% unsecured senior debentures due July 30, 2030; interest on the senior notes and debentures will be payable semi-annually. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay bank debt, including commercial paper. During March 2001, these notes and debentures were exchanged for registered notes and debentures. The unsecured senior debentures and the unsecured senior notes due July 30, 2010 are redeemable at any time at their principal amount plus the applicable premium and accrued interest.     On August 1, 2000, the Company issued $1.15 billion of 7.70% unsecured senior notes due July 30, 2010 and $500 million of 7.875% unsecured senior debentures due July 30, 2030; interest on the senior notes and debentures will be payable semi-annually. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay bank debt, including commercial paper. The senior notes and debentures are redeemable at any time at their principal amount plus the applicable premium and accrued interest.     On February 1, 2001, the Company redeemed all $60.3 million outstanding of Infinity Broadcasting's 9% senior subordinated notes due 2006 at a redemption price equal to 104.5% of the principal amount. On December 1, 2000, the Company redeemed all $105.3 million outstanding of Infinity Broadcasting's 9.75% senior subordinated notes due 2005 at a redemption price equal to 104.9% of the principal amount.     During 1999, the Company redeemed the remaining $211.8 million principal amount of its 8% merger debentures outstanding and recognized an extraordinary loss of $37.4 million, net of tax, on the early redemption.     The Company has classified short-term indebtedness as long-term debt based upon its intent and ability to refinance such indebtedness on a long-term basis. The Company's scheduled maturities of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2000, excluding capital leases, are as follows: ---------------------------------------------------------- Year of Maturity                         2001     2002    2003   2004    2005     ---------------------------------------------------------- Long-term debt  $1,557.8 $2,507.4 $911.7 $667.5 $2,924.8     ---------------------------------------------------------- Blockbuster Credit Agreement     On June 21, 1999, Blockbuster entered into a $1.9 billion unsecured credit agreement (the "Blockbuster Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks. The Blockbuster Credit Agreement was comprised of a $700                                       II-23 million long-term revolver due July 1, 2004; a $600 million term loan due in quarterly installments beginning April 1, 2002 and ending July 1, 2004; and a $600 million short-term revolver, which was paid down during 2000. The repayment of the short-term revolver permanently reduced the borrowing capacity under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement from $1.9 billion to $1.3 billion. Interest rates under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement are based on the prime rate or LIBOR at Blockbuster's option at the time of borrowing. A variable commitment fee based on the total leverage ratio is charged on the unused amount of the revolver (.25% at December 31, 2000).     The Blockbuster Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, relate to the payment of dividends, repurchase of Blockbuster's common stock or other distributions and also require compliance with certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. At December 31, 2000, Blockbuster was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement.     On June 23, 1999, Blockbuster borrowed $1.6 billion, comprised of $400 million borrowed under the long-term revolver, $600 million borrowed under the term loan, and $600 million under the short-term revolver. The proceeds of the borrowings were used to pay amounts owed to Viacom. Blockbuster repaid $442.9 million of the short-term revolver through proceeds from its initial public offering and repaid the remaining $157.1 million of the short-term revolver during the year ended December 31, 2000. Blockbuster had $278.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the long-term revolver at December 31, 2000. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2000 for these borrowings was 8.0%.     Blockbuster's scheduled maturities of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2000, excluding capital leases, are as follows: ----------------------------------------------- Year of Maturity                      2001  2002   2003   2004  2005     ----------------------------------------------- Long-term debt  $8.0 $158.8 $279.3 $599.9 $1.0     ----------------------------------------------- Market Risk     The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The derivative instruments used are foreign exchange forward contracts, spots and options. The foreign exchange contracts have principally been used to hedge the British Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the European Union's common currency (the "Euro"). These derivatives, which are over-the-counter instruments, are non-leveraged. Realized gains and losses on contracts that hedge anticipated future cash flows are recognized in "Other items, net" and were not material in any of the periods presented. The Company is primarily vulnerable to changes in LIBOR which is the rate currently used in existing agreements; however, the Company does not believe this exposure to be material.     The Company entered into interest rate exchange agreements with off-balance sheet risk in order to reduce its exposure to changes in interest on its variable rate long-term debt and/or take advantage of changes in interest rates. These interest rate exchange agreements include interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. At December 31, 2000, the Company had no interest rate exchange agreements outstanding with commercial banks.  Other Matters     On August 10, 1999, Blockbuster sold to the public 31 million shares of its Class A common stock for $15 per share. The shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company, through its ownership of all of the 144 million shares of Blockbuster Class B common stock outstanding, retained approximately 82% of                                       II-24 the total equity value in, and approximately 96% of the combined voting power of, Blockbuster. Proceeds from the offering aggregated $442.9 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and before payment of offering expenses, and were used by Blockbuster to repay outstanding indebtedness under a $1.9 billion term and revolving credit agreement. The Company recorded a reduction to equity of approximately $662 million as a result of the issuance of subsidiary stock.     In 1999, the Company announced that it intended to split-off Blockbuster by offering to exchange all of its shares of Blockbuster common stock for shares of the Company's common stock. The split-off was subject to approval by the Company's Board of Directors and an assessment of market conditions. The Company no longer has any plans for the split-off of Blockbuster.   Recent Pronouncements     In June 2000, the Company elected early adoption of Statement of Position 00-2, "Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films" ("SOP 00-2"). SOP 00- 2 established new film accounting standards, including changes in revenue recognition and accounting for advertising, development and overhead costs. Under the new accounting standard, all exploitation costs such as advertising expenses, marketing costs and video duplication costs for theatrical and television product will be expensed as incurred, whereas under the old accounting standards, these costs were capitalized and amortized over the products' lifetime. As a result of this early adoption in the second quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash charge of $754 million ($452 million after-tax or $.37 per share). This charge has been reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, effective January 1, 2000, in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000. Under the SOP 00-2 for the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company reported lower operating results of approximately $77 million.     In June 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement 139 ("SFAS 139") which rescinds FASB Statement 53 on financial reporting by motion picture film producers or distributors. SFAS 139 requires public companies to follow the guidance provided by SOP 00-2.     In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"), effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000, as amended by Statements 137 and 138 in June 1999 and June 2000, respectively. These statements require companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. The statements also established new accounting rules for hedging instruments which, depending on the nature of the hedge, require that changes in the fair value of the derivatives either be offset against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or be recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company adopted SFAS 133, as amended, on January 1, 2001, which resulted in an immaterial impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial position.     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101"). SAB 101 summarizes certain of the SEC's staff's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company adopted SAB 101 and accordingly, reclassified previously reported gross revenues in its Television and Entertainment segments to a net basis.   Euro Conversion     In January 1999, eleven member countries of the European Union established permanent conversion rates between their existing currencies and the Euro. The transition period for the introduction of the Euro will be between January 1, 1999 and June 30, 2002. The Company conducts business in member countries and is addressing the issues involved with the introduction of the Euro. The more important issues facing the Company include: converting information technology systems, reassessing currency risk, negotiating and amending licensing agreements and contracts, and processing tax, accounting, payroll and customer records.                                       II-25 Based on the progress to date, the Company believes that the transition to the Euro currency will not have a significant impact on the manner in which it conducts its business affairs and processes its business and accounting records. Accordingly, conversion to the Euro is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.  Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements     This document and the documents incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, including "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition", contain both historical and forward- looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather reflect the Company's current expectations concerning future results and events. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will" or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe the Company's objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be different from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements.     The following important factors, among others, could affect future results, causing these results to differ materially from those expressed in the Company's forward-looking statements:    .  The Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising      time on its over-the-air networks, basic cable networks, television      stations, radio stations and outdoor businesses. The advertising market      has recently experienced softness. The sale of advertising time is      affected by viewer demographics, viewer ratings and market conditions      for advertising time. Adverse changes to any of these factors could have      a negative effect on revenues.    .  Operating results derived from the Company's motion picture and      television production fluctuate depending primarily upon cost of such      productions and acceptance of such productions by the public, which are      difficult to predict. Motion picture and television production has      experienced cycles in which increased costs of talent and other factors      have resulted in higher production costs. In addition, the commercial      success of the Company's motion picture and television productions also      depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing productions,      and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure      time activities.    .  The Company's operating results also fluctuate due to the timing and      availability of theatrical and home video releases, as well as a result      of the recording of license fees for television exhibition of motion      pictures and for syndication and basic cable exhibition of television      programming in the period that the products are available for such      exhibition.    .  The Company's basic cable networks and premium subscription television      networks are dependent on affiliation agreements with cable and direct      broadcast satellite distributors on acceptable terms. The loss of      carriage on such distributors, or continued carriage on less favorable      terms, could adversely affect, with respect to basic cable networks,      revenues from subscriber fees and the ability to sell advertising time,      and with respect to premium subscription television networks, subscriber      fee revenues.    .  Some of the Company's businesses are seasonal. More specifically, the      home video business and consumer publishing business are subject to      increased periods of demand coinciding with summer and winter holidays,      while a substantial majority of the theme parks operating income is      generated from May through September. In addition, the home video and      theme parks businesses' revenues are influenced by weather.                                       II-26 .  Changes in FCC laws and regulations could, directly or indirectly,      adversely affect the operations and ownership of the Company's      properties.    .  The Company has contingent liabilities related to discontinued      operations, including environmental liabilities and pending litigation.      While there can be no assurance in this regard, the pending or potential      litigation, environmental and other liabilities should not have a      material adverse effect on the Company.    .  The Company may be adversely affected by changes in technology and its      effect on competition in the Company's markets.    .  Labor agreements covering the services of writers and actors which the      Company utilizes in its motion picture and television businesses are      currently scheduled to expire during 2001. Work stoppages and/or higher      costs in connection with these agreements could adversely impact the      ability of the Company to produce or acquire new programming.    .  Other economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors      affecting the Company's businesses generally.     These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on our future results. The forward-looking statements included in this document are only made as of the date of this document and the Company does not have any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. The Company cannot assure you that projected results or events will be achieved. You should review carefully all information, including the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements, included or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.     Response to this item is included in "Item 7--Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition--Market Risk."                                       II-27 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Viacom Inc.     In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows and of stockholders' equity and comprehensive income present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Viacom Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 14(a) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  February 12, 2001, except for the first paragraph of Note 2, which is as of February 21, 2001                                       II-28 MANAGEMENT'S STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING     Management has prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and related notes of Viacom Inc. They have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include amounts based on judgments and estimates by management. All financial information in this annual report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.     The Company maintains internal accounting control systems and related policies and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and properly recorded, and that accounting records may be relied upon for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and other financial information. The design, monitoring, and revision of internal accounting control systems involve, among other things, management's judgment with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific control measures. The Company also maintains an internal audit function which evaluates and reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal accounting controls, policies and procedures.     Viacom Inc.'s consolidated financial statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, who have expressed their opinion with respect to the presentation of these statements.     The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is comprised solely of directors who are not employees of the Company, meets periodically with the independent accountants, with our internal auditors, as well as with management, to review accounting, auditing, internal accounting controls and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee is also responsible for recommending to the Board of Directors the independent accounting firm to be retained for the coming year, subject to stockholder approval. The independent accountants and the internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee with and without management's presence.

II-33 VIACOM INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  1) DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     Basis of Presentation--Viacom Inc. ("Viacom" or the "Company") is a diversified company with operations in seven segments: (i) Cable Networks, (ii) Television, (iii) Infinity, (iv) Entertainment, (v) Video, (vi) Publishing and (vii) Online. On May 4, 2000, CBS Corporation ("CBS") merged with and into the Company and effective from this date, CBS' results of operations are included in the Company's consolidated results of operations (See Note 3). See Note 16 regarding the relative contribution to revenues and operating results from each of the reportable segments.     Use of Estimates--The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could subsequently differ from those estimates.     Principles of Consolidation--The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and investments of more than 50% in subsidiaries and other entities. Investments in affiliated companies over which the Company has a significant influence or ownership of more than 20% but less than or equal to 50% are accounted for under the equity method. Investments of 20% or less are accounted for under the cost method. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.     Cash and Cash Equivalents--Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term (three months or less) highly liquid investments. At December 31, 2000, certain restrictions existed on Infinity Broadcasting Corporation's ("Infinity Broadcasting") cash balance of $143.0 million included as part of cash and cash equivalents of $934.5 million in the consolidated balance sheet. Infinity Broadcasting's cash became available to the Company upon the merger with Infinity Broadcasting, effective February 21, 2001 (See Note 2).     Inventories--Inventories related to theatrical and television product (which includes direct production costs, production overhead and acquisition costs) are stated at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Inventories are amortized, and estimated liabilities for residuals and participation are accrued, for an individual product based on the proportion that current estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues. Estimates for initial domestic syndication and basic cable revenues are not included in the estimated lifetime revenues of network series until such sales are probable. These estimates are periodically reviewed. As a result of the adoption of Statement of Position 00-2, "Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films," the costs of feature and television films are classified as non-current assets.     The Company estimates that approximately 95% of unamortized costs of completed and released films (excluding amounts allocated under purchase accounting) at December 31, 2000 will be amortized within the next three years. Approximately $491 million of released, and completed and not released, film costs are expected to be amortized during the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2000, unamortized acquired film libraries of approximately $546 million remain to be amortized on a straight-line basis over an average remaining life of 13 years.     Inventories related to base stock videocassettes (generally less than five copies per title for each store) are recorded at cost and a portion of these costs are amortized on an accelerated basis over three months, with the remaining base stock videocassette costs amortized on a straight-line basis over 33 months to an estimated $4 salvage value. The cost of non-base stock videocassettes is amortized on an accelerated basis over three months to an estimated $4 salvage value. Video games and base-stock DVDs are amortized on an accelerated basis over a 12 month period to an estimated $10 and $4 salvage value, respectively (See Note 6).                                       II-34 VIACOM INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)      Program Rights--The Company acquires rights to programming and produces programming to exhibit on its broadcast networks, cable networks and broadcast stations. The costs incurred in acquiring and producing programs are capitalized and amortized over the license period or projected useful life of the programming. Program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable, and the program is accepted and available for airing.     Property and Equipment--Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows: Buildings (including capital leases)    20 to 40 years          Leasehold improvements                   4 to 15 years          Advertising structures                   5 to 20 years          Equipment and other (including capital           leases)                                 3 to 20 years Depreciation expense, including capitalized lease amortization, was $799.7 million (2000), $496.8 million (1999) and $441.8 million (1998). Amortization expense related to capital leases was $77.8 million (2000), $80.1 million (1999) and $62.6 million (1998). Accumulated amortization of capital leases was $296.6 million at December 31, 2000 and $295.5 million at December 31, 1999.     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets--The Company assesses long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows generated by those assets to their net carrying value. The amount of impairment loss, if any, will generally be measured by the difference between the net book value of the assets and the estimated fair value of the related assets.     Intangible Assets--Intangible assets, which primarily consist of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of tangible assets and liabilities acquired ("goodwill") and FCC licenses, are generally amortized by the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of up to 40 years. The Company evaluates the amortization period of intangibles on an ongoing basis in light of changes in any business conditions, events or circumstances that may indicate the potential impairment of intangible assets. At December 31, 2000, approximately $10.9 billion of intangible assets are attributable to FCC licenses. Accumulated amortization of intangible assets was $3.4 billion at December 31, 2000 and $1.9 billion at December 31, 1999.     Revenue Recognition--Subscriber fees for Cable Networks are recognized in the period the service is provided. Advertising revenues are recognized in the period during which spots are aired. Video segment revenues are recognized at the time of rental or sale. The Publishing segment recognizes revenue when merchandise is shipped. Revenues from the sale of outdoor advertising space are recognized ratably over the contract terms. Online advertising revenue is recognized ratably during the period in which the advertising is displayed and obligations are satisfied.     Revenues from films in the domestic and foreign theatrical markets are recognized as films are exhibited; revenues from the sale of videocassettes, discs and DVDs are recognized upon availability of sale to the public; and revenues from all television sources are recognized upon availability of the film for telecast. On average, the length of the initial revenue cycle for feature films approximates four to seven years.     Television series initially produced for the networks and first-run syndication are generally licensed to domestic and foreign markets concurrently. The more successful series are later syndicated in domestic markets and in certain foreign markets. The length of the revenue cycle for television series will vary depending on the number of seasons a series remains in active production.

AND SUBSIDIARIES              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  are recognized in the period that the films or television series are available for telecast and therefore may cause fluctuation in operating results.     Interest--Costs associated with the refinancing or issuance of debt, as well as with debt discount, are expensed as interest over the term of the related debt. The Company may enter into interest rate exchange agreements; the amount to be paid or received under such agreements would be accrued as interest rates change and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. Amounts paid for purchased interest rate cap agreements would be amortized as interest expense over the term of the agreement.     Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions--The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while results of operations are translated at average exchange rates for the respective periods. The resulting translation gains or losses are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses have been included in "Other items, net".     Subsidiary Stock Transactions--Gains or losses arising from issuances by a subsidiary of its own stock in a public offering are recorded within stockholders' equity.     Provision for Doubtful Accounts--The provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense was $124.1 million (2000), $33.5 million (1999) and $29.5 million (1998).     Net Earnings (Loss) per Common Share--Basic earnings per share is based upon the net earnings applicable to common shares after preferred dividend requirements and divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the effect of the assumed conversions of convertible securities and the exercise of stock options only in the periods in which such effect would have been dilutive.     The numerator used in the calculation of both basic and diluted EPS for each respective year reflects earnings (loss) from continuing operations less preferred stock dividends of $.4 million for 1999 and $57.2 million for 1998 plus the (premium) discount on preferred stock of ($12) million for 1999 and $30 million for 1998, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1998, incremental shares of 30.1 million and 9.5 million, respectively, for the assumed exercise of stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been anti- dilutive.     The table below presents a reconciliation of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS: 2000   1999  1998                                                 ------- ----- ----- Weighted average shares for basic EPS      1,225.3 695.2 708.7      Plus incremental shares for stock options      --   14.3   --                                                 ------- ----- -----      Weighted average shares for diluted EPS    1,225.3 709.5 708.7                                                 ======= ===== ===== In the first quarter of 2001, the Company completed the acquisitions of Infinity Broadcasting and BET Holdings II, Inc.

Change in Accounting--In June 2000, the Company elected early adoption of Statement of Position 00-2, "Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films" ("SOP 00-2"). SOP 00-2 established new film accounting standards, including changes in revenue recognition and accounting for advertising, development and overhead costs. Under the new accounting standard, all exploitation costs such as advertising expenses, marketing costs and video duplication costs for theatrical and television product will be expensed as incurred, whereas under the old accounting standards, these costs were capitalized and amortized over the products' lifetime. As a result of this early adoption in the second quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash charge of $754 million ($452 million after-tax or $.37 per share). This charge has been reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, effective January 1, 2000, in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000. Under SOP 00-2 for the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company reported lower operating results of approximately $77 million.     In June 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement 139 ("SFAS 139") which rescinds FASB Statement 53 on financial reporting by motion picture film producers or distributors. SFAS 139 requires public companies to follow the guidance provided by SOP 00-2.     Recent Pronouncements--In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"), effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000, as amended by Statements 137 and 138 in June 1999 and June 2000, respectively. These statements require companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. The statements also established new accounting rules for hedging instruments which, depending on the nature of the hedge, require that changes in the fair value of the derivatives either be offset against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or be recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company adopted SFAS 133, as amended, on January 1, 2001, which resulted in an immaterial impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial position.     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101"). SAB 101 summarizes certain of the SEC's staff's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company adopted SAB 101 and accordingly, reclassified previously reported gross revenues in its Television and Entertainment segments to a net basis.                                        II-37 VIACOM INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  2) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS     On February 21, 2001, the Company completed a merger with Infinity Broadcasting, acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of Infinity common stock that it did not already own, approximately 36%. Under the terms of the merger, which is tax free for the stockholders of Infinity and Viacom, each share of Infinity Class A common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.592 of a share of Viacom Class B Common Stock. The Infinity merger will be accounted for at historical cost, with the exception of minority interest, which will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The total purchase price of approximately $13.4 billion represents the issuance of approximately 232 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the fair value of Infinity stock options assumed by the Company.     On February 1, 2001, the Company initiated a share repurchase program to acquire up to $2.0 billion in the Company's Class B Common Stock and through March 19, 2001, the Company had repurchased under this program 2.8 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $141.5 million.     On January 23, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of BET for approximately $3 billion, which principally represents the issuance of approximately 43.4 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the assumption by the Company of approximately $590 million in debt. Beginning in the first quarter of 2001, BET's results will be reported as part of the Cable Networks segment.  3) ACQUISITIONS     On May 4, 2000, CBS was merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). The total purchase price of approximately $39.8 billion included approximately $37.7 billion for the issuance of 825.5 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and 11,004 shares of Viacom Series C convertible preferred stock, which were subsequently converted into 11.0 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and approximately $1.9 billion for the fair value of CBS stock options assumed by the Company and transaction costs. In addition, Viacom assumed approximately $3.7 billion of CBS debt.     The Merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. CBS' results of operations are included in the Company's reported consolidated results of operations from the effective date of acquisition. The total cost to acquire CBS has been allocated based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of the Merger. The excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired of approximately $50 billion was allocated to intangibles and is being amortized on a straight-line basis not to exceed 40 years. The final allocation of the purchase price will be based on comprehensive final evaluations of the fair value of CBS' tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.     The Company presently holds television stations which reach approximately 41% of United States television households (as calculated for this purpose under rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC"), which apply a 50% discount to the reach of UHF stations). These stations reach approximately 6% in excess of the 35% limit permitted by FCC regulations. In connection with FCC approval of the Merger, the Company was given one year to come into compliance with the limit. The Company has challenged the rule in federal court and is seeking a stay of the requirement to come into compliance with the limit, pending judicial review of the national ownership cap. The Company was also provided with one year to come into compliance with the FCC's "dual network" rule, which prohibits the Company from owning and controlling both CBS and United Paramount Network ("UPN"). On June 20, 2000, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making, in which it proposes to modify the dual network rule, the effect of which would be to permit the Company to own both CBS and UPN.                                        II-38 VIACOM INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)     On September 15, 2000, Infinity Broadcasting completed the acquisition of Memphis radio stations WMC-AM and WMC-FM from Raycom Media for approximately $76 million.     On August 24, 2000, Infinity Broadcasting completed the acquisition of 18 radio stations from Clear Channel Communications, Inc. for $1.4 billion in an asset transaction. These stations are located in San Diego, Phoenix, Denver, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Orlando and Greensboro--Winston-Salem.     On July 1, 2000, Infinity Broadcasting completed the acquisition of Waterman Broadcasting Corporation of Texas ("Waterman Broadcasting") in exchange for approximately 2.7 million shares of Infinity Broadcasting Class A common stock valued at approximately $88 million. Waterman Broadcasting owns radio stations KTSA-AM and KTFM-FM in San Antonio, Texas.     During the second quarter of 2000, Infinity Broadcasting completed the acquisition of Giraudy, one of France's largest outdoor advertising companies, for approximately $400 million. Infinity Broadcasting also acquired Societa Manifesti & Affisioni S.p.A., one of the leading Italian outdoor media sales companies, for approximately $90 million.     On March 31, 2000, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in UPN that it did not already own. In the second quarter of 2000, the Company consolidated UPN's results of operations. Prior to this acquisition, the Company reported its proportionate share of net losses of UPN in "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.     The unaudited condensed pro forma results of operations data presented below assumes the Merger, pre-merger CBS acquisitions, and other acquisitions, including UPN and the acquisition of Infinity Broadcasting's Class A common stock, had occurred as of January 1, 1999. The unaudited condensed pro forma results of operations were prepared based upon the historical consolidated results of operations of the Company and CBS prior to the Merger, adjusted to exclude the non-recurring merger-related charges and to reflect the adoption of the change in accounting principle as of the beginning of each period presented (see Note 1). Financial results of CBS subsequent to the date of acquisition are included in the Company's financial statements. The pre-merger CBS acquisitions assumed to have been acquired January 1, 1999 are Infinity Outdoor, King World and two Texas television stations. The aggregate impact of other acquisitions was not material to consolidated results of operations.

AND SUBSIDIARIES              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   4) MERGER-RELATED AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES     In the second quarter of 2000, the Company recorded non-recurring merger- related charges of $698 million ($505 million after-tax or $.41 per share) associated with the integration of Viacom and CBS and the acquisition of UPN (see Note 3). These amounts included non-cash charges of $415 million principally attributable to compensation for stock options and $283 million of cash payments and accrued liabilities for severance, transaction fees and integration costs. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had paid and charged approximately $92 million for severance liabilities, $27 million for transaction fees and $6 million related to integration costs.     In connection with the integration of the operations of Spelling into Paramount Television, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $81.1 million, of which $70.3 million was recorded as a restructuring charge and $10.8 million was recorded as part of depreciation expense in the third quarter of 1999. Included in the charge were severance and employee related costs of $48.1 million, lease termination and other occupancy costs of $17.7 million and other exit costs of $4.5 million. Severance and other employee related costs represent the costs to terminate approximately 250 employees engaged in legal, sales, marketing, finance, information systems, technical support and human resources for Spelling. Lease termination and other occupancy costs principally represent the expenses associated with vacating existing lease obligations in New York and Los Angeles. The depreciation expense of approximately $10.8 million was associated with the fixed asset write-offs for software, leasehold improvements and equipment located at these premises. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had paid and charged approximately $43.6 million against the severance liability, $11.3 million against lease termination and other occupancy costs and $2.0 million against the other exit costs.  5) DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS     The Company presented its educational, professional and reference publishing businesses ("Non-Consumer Publishing") and its music retail stores as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 1998.     On November 27, 1998, the Company completed the sale of Non-Consumer Publishing for $4.6 billion in cash. Viacom retained its consumer publishing operations, including the Simon & Schuster name. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a net gain on the transaction of $65.5 million.     On October 26, 1998, the Company completed the sale of its music retail stores to Wherehouse Entertainment, Inc. for $115 million in cash and recorded a net loss on the transaction of $138.5 million. The Company had previously closed the remaining music stores that were not part of the transaction.     Summarized financial data of discontinued operations are as follows: For the Year ended        Non-Consumer      December 31, 1998(1)(2)    Publishing  Music    Total     --------------------------------------------------------- Revenues                    $1,718.0   $293.5  $2,011.5      Loss from operations       before income taxes           (15.2)   (20.9)    (36.1)      Benefit (provision) for       income taxes                  (26.0)     8.0     (18.0)      Net loss                       (41.2)   (12.9)    (54.1)     --------------------------------------------------------- (1) Results of operations reflect Non-Consumer Publishing for the period     January 1 through November 26, 1998. (2) Results of operations reflect the music retail stores for the period     January 1 through August 10, 1998.                                       II-40 VIACOM INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)      The provision for income taxes of $18.0 million for 1998 represents an effective tax rate of (49.9%). The differences between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal tax rate of 35% principally relate to certain non- deductible expenses, the allocation of non-deductible goodwill amortization, state and local taxes.

Blockbuster adopted this new method of amortization because it implemented a new business model, including revenue sharing agreements with Hollywood studios, which dramatically increased the number of videocassettes in the stores and is satisfying consumer demand over a shorter period of time. Revenue sharing allows Blockbuster to acquire videocassettes at a lower product cost than the traditional buying arrangements, with a percentage of the net rental revenues shared with the studios over a contractually determined period of time. As the new business model results in a greater proportion of rental revenue over a shorter period of time, Blockbuster changed its method of amortizing rental inventory in order to more closely match expenses in proportion with the anticipated revenues to be generated therefrom.     Pursuant to the new accounting method, the Company records base stock videocassettes (generally less than five copies per title for each store) at cost and amortizes a portion of these costs on an accelerated basis over three months, with the remaining base stock videocassette costs amortized on a straight-line basis over 33 months to an estimated $4 salvage value. The cost of non-base stock videocassettes is amortized on an accelerated basis over three months to an estimated $4 salvage value. Video games and base-stock DVDs are amortized on an accelerated basis over a 12-month period to an estimated $10 and $4 salvage value, respectively. Revenue sharing payments are expensed when revenues are earned pursuant to the applicable contractual arrangements.     The new method of accounting was applied to rental inventory held at April 1, 1998. The adoption of the new method of amortization was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. The Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $436.7 million to operating expenses in the second quarter of 1998. Approximately $424.3 million of the charge represented an adjustment to the carrying value of the rental tapes due to the new method of accounting and approximately $12.4 million represented a write- down of retail inventory.  7) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE     As of December 31, 2000, the Company had an aggregate of $550.0 million outstanding under revolving receivable securitization programs. Proceeds from the securitization programs were used to reduce outstanding borrowings.                                       II-41 VIACOM INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)      The following is a summary of combined financial information that is based on information provided by the equity investees.

This difference is being amortized over a five-year period and as of December 31, 2000 the unamortized difference is $127.5 million. The amortization expense of the Company's initial basis is presented as "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.     At December 31, 2000, the Company's equity investments included three publicly traded Internet-based companies: Hollywood Media Corp., MarketWatch.com, Inc. and Switchboard Incorporated. Based upon quoted market prices at December 31, 2000, the aggregate market value of such investments was approximately $69.6 million.     At the date of acquisition, for equity investments in Internet-based companies, the Company typically records the investment at an amount equal to the cash consideration paid plus the fair value of the advertising and promotion time to be provided. The associated obligation to provide future advertising and promotion time is non-cash and is recorded as deferred revenue at an amount equal to the fair value of the advertising and promotion time to be provided. Any related deferred revenue balance is presented as deferred income and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred revenue is relieved and barter revenue is recognized as the related advertising and promotion time is delivered. Barter revenue of $125.2 million has been recognized for the year ended December 31, 2000.     At December 31, 2000, the Company had $126.7 million in cost investments that are included as a component of other assets. The 2000 mark-to-market adjustments in fair value for the publicly traded cost investments were $33.7 million, net of tax, and were recorded as a decrease in other comprehensive income. The Company determined that some of its cost investments in Internet- based companies experienced an other than temporary decline in market value as of December 31, 2000, and accordingly, the Company recorded a non-cash write- down of such investments for approximately $66.9 million in "Other items, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.     The Company, through the normal course of business, is involved in transactions with affiliated companies that have not been material in any of the periods presented.

The notes and debentures are presented net of an aggregate unamortized discount of $21.4 million as of December 31, 2000 and $10.1 million as of December 31, 1999.     As a result of the Merger, Viacom assumed approximately $3.7 billion of CBS debt.     On March 28, 2000, the Viacom Credit Agreements were amended to allow for the merger of CBS with and into the Company. On April 17, 2000, the CBS credit agreement, which consisted of a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing August 29, 2001 and the Infinity credit agreement, which consisted of a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing August 29, 2001, were amended to allow for the merger of CBS with and into the Company. On May 3, 2000, Infinity Broadcasting entered into two new credit facilities, totaling $1.95 billion, comprised of a $1.45 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and a $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility.                                       II-44 VIACOM INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  Borrowing rates under the CBS and Infinity facilities are determined at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on a floating rate index, the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR"), plus a margin based on the respective senior unsecured debt rating.     On March 7, 2001, the Company cancelled all of the above-mentioned credit agreements other than the Infinity Broadcasting $1.45 billion facility, and entered into two new credit facilities. These two new facilities total $3.5 billion and are comprised of a $1.5 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and a $2.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility. The Company also amended and restated the Infinity Broadcasting $1.45 billion facility; the terms and conditions were substantially conformed to the new $1.5 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and the Company was designated as the borrower. The primary purpose of the facilities is to support commercial paper borrowings. The Company, at its option, may borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the new $1.5 billion 5-year revolving credit facility. Borrowing rates under the facilities are determined at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on LIBOR plus a margin based on the Company's senior unsecured debt rating. At December 31, 2000, LIBOR for borrowing periods of one month and two months were 6.56% and 6.49%, respectively.     The new and amended facilities contain certain covenants which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2000 the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants.     The Company pays a commitment fee based on the total amount of the loan commitments. As of March 7, 2001, the facilities totaled $4.95 billion.     In March 2001, the Company increased its commercial paper program from $4.0 billion to $4.95 billion and Infinity Broadcasting cancelled its $3.25 billion commercial paper program. Borrowings under the program have maturities of less than a year and are supported by unused committed bank facilities. At December 31, 2000, the Company had borrowings under the program of approximately $1.7 billion and Infinity Broadcasting had borrowings under its commercial paper program of approximately $2.1 billion.     On January 9, 2001, the Company issued, under Rule 144A, $400 million of 6.40% unsecured senior notes due January 30, 2006, $500 million of 7.70% unsecured senior notes due July 30, 2010, and $750 million of 7.875% unsecured senior debentures due July 30, 2030; interest on the senior notes and debentures will be payable semi-annually. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay bank debt, including commercial paper. During March 2001, these notes and debentures were exchanged for registered notes and debentures. The unsecured senior debentures and the unsecured senior notes due July 30, 2010 are redeemable at any time at their principal amount plus the applicable premium and accrued interest.     On August 1, 2000, the Company issued $1.15 billion of 7.70% unsecured senior notes due July 30, 2010 and $500 million of 7.875% unsecured senior debentures due July 30, 2030; interest on the senior notes and debentures will be payable semi-annually. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay bank debt, including commercial paper. The senior notes and debentures are redeemable at any time at their principal amount plus the applicable premium and accrued interest.     On February 1, 2001, the Company redeemed all $60.3 million outstanding of Infinity Broadcasting's 9% senior subordinated notes due 2006 at a redemption price equal to 104.5% of the principal amount. On December 1, 2000, the Company redeemed all $105.3 million outstanding of Infinity Broadcasting's 9.75% senior subordinated notes due 2005 at a redemption price equal to 104.9% of the principal amount.                                       II-45 VIACOM INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)      During 1999, the Company redeemed the remaining $211.8 million principal amount of its 8% merger debentures outstanding and recognized an extraordinary loss of $37.4 million, net of tax, on the early redemption.     The Company has classified short-term indebtedness as long-term debt based upon its intent and ability to refinance such indebtedness on a long-term basis. The Company's scheduled maturities of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2000, excluding capital leases, are as follows: --------------------------------------------------------- Year of Maturity                        2001     2002    2003   2004    2005     --------------------------------------------------------- Long-term debt  $1,557.8 $2,507.4 $911.7 $667.5 $2,924.8     --------------------------------------------------------- Blockbuster Credit Agreement     On June 21, 1999, Blockbuster entered into a $1.9 billion unsecured credit agreement (the "Blockbuster Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks. The Blockbuster Credit Agreement was comprised of a $700 million long-term revolver due July 1, 2004; a $600 million term loan due in quarterly installments beginning April 1, 2002 and ending July 1, 2004; and a $600 million short-term revolver, which was paid down during 2000. The repayment of the short-term revolver permanently reduced the borrowing capacity under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement from $1.9 billion to $1.3 billion. Interest rates under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement are based on the prime rate or LIBOR at Blockbuster's option at the time of the borrowing. A variable commitment fee based on the total leverage ratio is charged on the unused amount of the revolver (.25% at December 31, 2000).     The Blockbuster Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, relate to the payment of dividends, repurchase of Blockbuster's common stock or other distributions and also require compliance with certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. At December 31, 2000, Blockbuster was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement.     On June 23, 1999, Blockbuster borrowed $1.6 billion, comprised of $400 million borrowed under the long-term revolver, $600 million borrowed under the term loan, and $600 million under the short-term revolver. The proceeds of the borrowings were used to pay amounts owed to Viacom. Blockbuster repaid $442.9 million of the short-term revolver through proceeds from its initial public offering and repaid the remaining $157.1 million of the short-term revolver during the year ended December 31, 2000. Blockbuster had $278.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the long-term revolver at December 31, 2000. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2000 for these borrowings was 8.0%.     Blockbuster's scheduled maturities of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2000, excluding capital leases, are as follows: ----------------------------------------------- Year of Maturity                      2001  2002   2003   2004  2005     ----------------------------------------------- Long-term debt  $8.0 $158.8 $279.3 $599.9 $1.0     ----------------------------------------------- 11) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS     The Company's carrying value of financial instruments approximates fair value, except for differences with respect to the notes and debentures and certain differences related to other financial instruments that are not significant. The carrying value of the senior debt and senior subordinated debt is $6.4 billion and the fair value, which is estimated based on quoted market prices, is $6.6 billion.                                        II-46 VIACOM INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)     The Company enters into interest rate exchange agreements with off-balance sheet risk in order to reduce its exposure to changes in interest on its variable rate long-term debt and/or take advantage of changes in interest rates. These interest rate exchange agreements include interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. At December 31, 2000, the Company had no interest rate exchange agreements outstanding with commercial banks.     The Company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the value of its firm commitments and certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows. These contracts generally mature within the calendar year. The Company does not enter into foreign currency contracts for speculative purposes. To date, the contracts utilized have been purchased options, spots and forward contracts. A spot or forward contract is an agreement between two parties to exchange a specified amount of foreign currency, at a specified exchange rate on a specified date. An option contract provides the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell currency at a fixed exchange rate on a future date. In 2000 the foreign exchange contracts have principally been used to hedge the British Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the European Union's common currency (the "Euro"). At December 31, 2000, the Company had outstanding contracts with a notional value of approximately $199 million that expire in 2001. Realized gains and losses on contracts that hedge anticipated future cash flows are recognized in "Other items, net" and were not material. Option premiums are expensed at the inception of the contract. Deferred gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts as of December 31, 2000 were not material.     The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. Outstanding letters of credit totaled $239 million at December 31, 2000. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. The Company's receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2000, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company's products and services are sold.  12) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY     During 2000, the Company repurchased 10,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock and 34.2 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $1.95 billion in the aggregate. During 1999, the Company had repurchased a total of 25,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock, 10.6 million shares of its Class B Common Stock and 1.1 million Viacom Five-Year Warrants, for approximately $466.4 million in the aggregate.     On July 7, 1999, the Viacom Five-Year Warrants expired. The Company received proceeds of approximately $317 million and issued approximately 9.0 million shares of its Class B Common Stock in connection with the exercise of 4.5 million warrants issued as part of the 1994 acquisition of Paramount Communications.     On December 2, 1998, the Company repurchased 12 million shares of its convertible preferred stock from Bell Atlantic Corporation for $564 million in cash. On January 5, 1999, the Company repurchased the remaining 12 million shares of its convertible preferred stock from Bell Atlantic Corporation for $612 million in cash.     Long-Term Incentive Plans--The Company has four Long-Term Incentive Plans (the "Plans"): the Viacom Long-Term Management Incentive Plan (the "Viacom Plan"), the Blockbuster Long-Term Management Incentive Plan (the "Blockbuster Plan"), the Infinity Stock-Based Compensation Plans (the "Infinity Plan") and MTVi Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "MTVi Plan"). The Plans provide for the issuance of fixed grants of equity-based interests, which include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, phantom shares and other equity-based interests.                                       II-47 VIACOM INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)      The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"). In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, the Company applies APB 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related interpretations in accounting for the Plans and accordingly, does not recognize compensation expense for any of the Plans because the Company typically does not issue options at exercise prices below the market value at date of grant. Had compensation expense for the Plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards consistent with the methodology prescribed by SFAS 123, the Company's consolidated net earnings (loss) would have been $(922.0) million or $(0.75) per basic and diluted common share, $263.2 million or $0.38 per basic and $0.37 per diluted common share, and $(162.9) million or $(0.23) per basic and diluted common share in 2000, 1999, and 1998 respectively. These pro forma effects may not be representative of future amounts since the estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period and additional options may be granted in future years.     Viacom Plan--The purpose of the Viacom Plan is to benefit and advance the interests of the Company by rewarding certain key employees for their contributions to the financial success of the Company and thereby motivating them to continue to make such contributions in the future. The Viacom Plan provides for fixed grants of equity-based interests pursuant to awards of phantom shares, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares or other equity-based interests ("Awards"), and for subsequent payments of cash with respect to phantom shares or stock appreciation rights based, subject to certain limits, on their appreciation in value over stated periods of time. The stock options generally vest over a four to six year period from the date of grant and expire 10 years after the date of grant. The Company has reserved a total of 14,038 shares of Viacom Inc. Class A Common Stock and 117,165,267 shares of Viacom Inc. Class B Common Stock for exercise of stock options.     During 2000, the total aggregate number of shares of Viacom Inc. Class B Common Stock that may be issued under the 1997 plan was increased by 5,000,000 shares. In the second quarter of 2000, the Viacom Inc. 2000 Long-Term Management Incentive Plan and 2000 Stock Option Plan for outside directors was adopted. An aggregate of 100,000,000 and 1,000,000 shares of Viacom Inc. Class B Common Stock may be issued under these plans, respectively. The stock options available for future grant under the Viacom Plans are as follows: December 31, 1998   14,849,484             December 31, 1999   11,726,413             December 31, 2000  107,266,077 The weighted-average fair value of each option as of the grant date was $27.39, $19.89 and $12.97 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2000   1999   1998                                        -----  -----  ----- Expected dividend yield(a)          --     --     --      Expected stock price volatility   32.10% 29.64% 32.76%      Risk-free interest rate            6.56%  6.11%  5.43%      Expected life of options (years)    6.8    7.5    6.0 -------- (a) The Company has not declared any cash dividends on its common stock for     any of the periods presented and has no present intention of so doing.

The tax benefit relating to losses from equity investments in 2000, 1999 and 1998 are $20.5 million, $17.7 million and $24.0 million, respectively, which represents an effective tax rate of 14.2%, 22.6% and 36.7%, respectively.     The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is presented net of a tax benefit of $301.6 million.     The difference between the effective tax rates and the statutory U.S. federal tax rate of 35% is principally due to the effect of non-deductible goodwill amortization, state and local taxes and foreign income taxed below statutory U.S. rates. In 2000 and 1999, respectively, $218.8 million and $58.8 million of income tax benefit was recorded as a component of stockholders' equity as a result of exercised stock options.

At December 31, 2000, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal, state and local and foreign jurisdiction of approximately $437.8 million, which expire in various years from 2001 through 2019. In addition, the Company had alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $203.2 million that have no expiration dates and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $64.3 million that expire through 2004.     The 2000 and 1999 deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance of $172.1 million and $96.0 million, respectively, principally relating to tax benefits of net operating losses which are not expected to be recognized as a result of certain limitations applied where there is a change of ownership.     The Company's share of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries not included in its consolidated federal income tax return that could be subject to additional income taxes if remitted, was approximately $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, respectively. No provision has been recorded for the U.S. or foreign taxes that could result from the remittance of such undistributed earnings since the Company intends to reinvest these earnings outside the United States indefinitely and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of such taxes.  14) PENSION PLANS, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS     The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have non-contributory pension plans covering specific groups of employees. The benefits for these plans are based primarily on an employee's years of service and pay near retirement. Participant employees are vested in the plans after five years of service. The Company's policy for all pension plans is to fund amounts in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Plan assets consist principally of common stocks, marketable bonds and U.S. government securities. The Company's Class B Common Stock represents approximately 8.0% and 20.8% of the plan assets' fair value at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.                                       II-53 VIACOM INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)      In addition, the Company sponsors a health and welfare plan that provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees and their covered dependents who are eligible for these benefits if they meet certain age and service requirements. The plan is contributory and contains cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance which are adjusted annually. The plan is not funded and the Company funds these benefits as claims are paid.     The significant changes in the components of the benefit obligation plan assets and the net periodic cost in 2000 were due primarily to the merger with CBS in May 2000.     The following table sets forth the change in benefit obligation for the Company's benefit plans: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Postretirement                                             Pension Benefits      Benefits      At December 31,                          2000     1999      2000    1999     --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Change in benefit obligation:       Benefit obligation, beginning of        year                                 $  795.2  $ 844.2  $   51.1  $53.6       Service cost                              38.5     33.7       2.1     .7       Interest cost                            278.9     61.5      59.3    3.7       Benefits paid                           (356.5)   (45.2)    (79.6)  (5.7)       Actuarial (gain)                         (14.8)  (147.9)     (1.2)  (1.6)       Business combinations                  4,238.7     52.0   1,092.0    --       Participants' contributions                 .5      --        2.9     .4       Amendments                                 1.5       .2      (6.4)   --       Cumulative translation adjustments        (3.0)     1.1       --     --       Special termination benefits               5.3      2.7       --     --       Curtailments                               --      (7.1)      --     --     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Benefit obligation, end of year       $4,984.3  $ 795.2  $1,120.2  $51.1     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     The following table sets forth the change in plan assets for the Company's benefit plans:      --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Postretirement                                             Pension Benefits      Benefits      At December 31,                          2000     1999      2000    1999     --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Change in plan assets:       Fair value of plan assets, beginning        of year                              $  973.8  $ 786.6  $    --   $ --       Actual return on plan assets             160.6    167.2       1.3    --       Employer contributions                    34.8      6.0      75.7    5.3       Benefits paid                           (356.5)   (45.2)    (79.6)  (5.7)       Business combinations                  4,082.4     56.5      46.1    --       Participants' contributions                 .5      --        2.9     .4       Cumulative translation adjustments        (4.4)     2.7       --     --     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Fair value of plan assets, end of        year                                 $4,891.2  $ 973.8  $   46.4  $ --     --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For those pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations were $511.9 million and $474.5 million, respectively, for 2000                                       II-54 VIACOM INC.

The Company contributes to multi-employer plans that provide pension and health and welfare benefits to certain employees under collective bargaining agreements. The contributions to these plans were $32.3 million (2000) and $26.1 million (1999).     In addition, the Company has defined contribution plans for the benefit of substantially all employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Employer contributions to such plans were $35.8 million, $16.5 million and $21.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.  15) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES     The Company has long-term noncancelable operating lease commitments for retail and office space and equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. The Company has also entered into capital leases for satellite transponders and buildings.     Infinity's outdoor advertising business has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on such media as buses, taxis, trains, bus shelters, terminals, billboards, and phone kiosks. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchiser is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment.

Rent expense amounted to $838.2 million (2000), $601.7 million (1999) and $533.8 million (1998).     The commitments of the Company for program license fees, estimated to aggregate approximately $15.2 billion, are not reflected in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2000. These commitments include approximately $10.8 billion for the acquisition of sports programming rights. A majority of such fees are payable over several years, as part of normal programming expenditures.     The Company, Blockbuster and Paramount Home Entertainment are among the defendants in a lawsuit filed on July 21, 1999 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas by one former and three present independent video retailers against the major motion picture studios and the Company. The plaintiffs, purporting to act as class representatives on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, allege that the Company and the studios conspired among themselves and with Blockbuster to restrain competition in the nationwide market for distribution of videocassettes for rental to the public in violation of federal and California law. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief under federal law as well as triple the amount of the alleged actual damages to themselves and those similarly situated under California statutes. In January 2001, plaintiffs moved to withdraw their California state law claims from the federal lawsuit in Texas and filed a substantially similar complaint with approximately 200 additional named plaintiffs in Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles. This complaint also sought certification of a nationwide class of similarly situated plaintiffs. In March 2001, the Texas court denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification of both the federal and the California state law claims in the federal action and denied the plaintiffs' motion to withdraw their California state law claims from that action. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' position in these litigations is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously in the litigations.     The Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits claiming various asbestos- related personal injuries, which allegedly occurred from use or inclusion of asbestos in certain products supplied by previously divested industrial business, generally in the pre-1970 time period. Typically, these lawsuits are brought against multiple defendants in state and Federal courts. The Company was neither a manufacturer nor a producer of asbestos. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had pending approximately 99,590 asbestos cases, excluding cases in various stages of settlement. The Company has brought suit against certain of its insurance carriers with respect                                       II-57 VIACOM INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)             (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  to asbestos claims. Under the terms of a settlement agreement resulting from this suit, carriers that have agreed to the settlement are now reimbursing the Company for a substantial portion of its current costs and settlement associated with asbestos claims. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to asbestos matters, that where appropriate it has adequately provided for resolution of matters and that any ultimate liability resulting from asbestos matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.     The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages, principally relating to discontinued operations conducted by companies acquired by the Company. The Company's liabilities reflect management's best estimate of its environmental exposure. Such liability was not discounted or reduced by potential insurance recoveries and reflects management's estimate of cost sharing at multiparty sites. The estimated liability was calculated based upon currently available facts, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. On the basis of its experience and the information currently available to it, the Company believes that the claims it has received will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity.     In addition to the above matters, the Company and various of its subsidiaries are parties to certain other legal proceedings. Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that these matters are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  16) REPORTABLE SEGMENTS     The following tables set forth the Company's financial performance by reportable operating segment. As a result of the merger with CBS, the segment information reflects a new organizational structure. Prior period information for Viacom has been reclassified to conform to the new structure. Intersegment revenues are recorded at fair market value as if the sales were to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation. Intersegment revenues of the Entertainment segment for 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $374.0 million, $248.4 million and $146.1 million, respectively. Residual costs of discontinued businesses primarily include pension and postretirement benefit costs for benefit plans retained by CBS for previously divested industrial businesses.     The Company evaluates performance based on many factors; one of the primary measures is EBITDA, defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is an appropriate measure of evaluating the operating performance of its segments. However, EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, operating income, net earnings, cash flows, and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). As EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

In 1999, "Other items, net" of $17.8 million principally reflects a $25.2 million foreign exchange gain and net gain of $17.1 million from the sale of land, property and equipment, partially offset by losses associated with securitizing trade receivables. In 1998, "Other items, net" of ($15.3) million reflects a loss of approximately $91 million associated with the closing of the Viacom Entertainment Store, losses associated with foreign exchange and securitizing trade receivables, partially offset by a gain of approximately $118.9 million from the sale of a cost investment.  18) EXTRAORDINARY LOSS     For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company recognized an extraordinary loss of $37.7 million, net of tax of $26.2 million, or a loss of $.06 per basic and diluted common share, on the early extinguishment of the 8.0% merger debentures and the 10.25% senior subordinated notes.     For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company recognized an extraordinary loss of $74.7 million, net of tax of $51.9 million, or a loss of $.10 per basic and diluted common share, on the early extinguishment of the 10.25% senior subordinated notes for $163.7 million, 7.0% senior subordinated debentures for $231.5 million and the 8.0% merger debentures for $555.6 million.  19) SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Year Ended December 31,                        2000      1999     1998     -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash payments for interest, net of amounts       capitalized                                $    651.4  $ 445.6  $ 668.2      Cash payments for income taxes              $     61.2  $ 615.8  $ 656.6      Supplemental schedule of non-cash       financing and investing activities:       Equipment acquired under capitalized        leases                                    $     72.9  $ 223.4  $ 116.8        Fair value of assets acquired             $ 61,910.3  $ 463.2  $ 138.2        Fair value of liabilities assumed          (14,849.3)     (.8)   (11.8)        Minority interest in net assets acquired    (5,712.1)  (150.0)     --        Cash paid, net of cash acquired             (2,380.0)  (312.4)  (126.4)     --------------------------------------------------------------------------       Impact on stockholders' equity             $ 38,968.9  $   --   $   --     -------------------------------------------------------------------------- II-61 VIACOM INC.

Accordingly, operating results are not      necessarily comparable on a year-to-year basis. (2)  Revenues have been restated based on the guidelines set forth in SAB 101,      "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements". (3)  The second quarter of 2000 included merger-related charges of $698      million ($505 million after-tax) related to the merger with CBS and the      acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in UPN that the Company did not      already own. (4)  The first quarter of 2000 included an after-tax charge of $452.3 million      related to the Company's early adoption of SOP 00-2. This charge was      reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle,      effective January 1, 2000. Under SOP 00-2, for the three months ended      March 31, 2000, the Company recognized additional operating expenses of      $14.6 million ($8.0 million after-tax). (5)  The third quarter of 1999 included a $81.1 million charge for integrating      the operations of Spelling into Paramount Television. (6)  The first and third quarter of 1999 included an extraordinary loss of      $23.5 million and $14.2 million, net of tax, respectively, on the early      extinguishment of debt (See Note 18).
